What is the future of the online world?
Robert Colvile meets Google's executive chairman
Eric Schmidt,
the man who knows the answer.
In the car park of an upmarket country house hotel near Watford, the
Telegraphs photographer is trying to get one of the worlds most powerful
men to fall into a hedge.
Lean over a little more, Eric, she urges,
in an attempt to conjure up a more interesting picture.
Rather than standing on dignity, Eric Schmidt
is happy to comply, shifting his weight deeper into the foliage with
avuncular nonchalance, before calling over his co-author for a shared
arboreal encounter.
Its not typical billionaire behaviour - especially when the next meeting in
your diary is with the Prime Minister.
But then, Schmidt is hardly a typical
billionaire. In 2001, the software executive was recruited by Googles young
founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to run the hottest
start-up in Silicon Valley.
After a decade as Googles CEO - during which it
grew into an internet-dominating behemoth - Schmidt stepped upstairs to
become executive chairman, serving as the companys public face, ambassador
and general plenipotentiary, as well as sitting on both David Cameron and
Barack Obamas business councils. If the hedgerows have left an impression,
he can certainly afford the dry cleaning bills.
Yet his willingness to play along with such stunts isnt the only thing that
marks Schmidt out.
For one thing, theres
The New Digital Age, the book hes in
Britain to publicize - first at Googles exclusive Zeitgeist conference
(described by the company as an intimate gathering of top global thinkers
and leaders, whose ranks have included everyone from Bill Clinton to Arsène
Wenger) and then at the Telegraph Hay Festival.
Im told that this is the most significant
book festival in the world, he says, excitedly.
Absolutely, I reassure him. He seems pleased.
Schmidt might not be terribly familiar with the literary circuit, but
theres no doubt that hes taking his book seriously. His co-author,
Jared Cohen, was a foreign policy strategist for the Bush and Obama
administrations, and now runs Google Ideas, the firms in-house think-tank.
Between them, they not only wrote up three different versions of the book -
the final one ruthlessly copy-edited by Schmidts daughter - but carved out
the time to travel to roughly 30 countries.
The book is littered with references to exotic
locations, such as Kabul and Baghdad (where Schmidt was among the first
visitors after the Iraq War). When, in the course of our conversation, Cohen
nominates Chad as the worlds poorest and most desperate country, I counter
with South Sudan: it turns out that he and Schmidt have visited both.
Why take such risks, particularly given Schmidts exalted position?
Cohen explains that the central theme of the
book - and of his work,
is what the world looks like when five
billion new people come online in the next decade.
And where, he asks, are those people?
Parts of the world where theres
instability, conflict, where the governance model is repressive. Theyre
actually going to be the vast majority of our future users, so Eric and
I sat down and said: Lets go meet them a little.
As a result, the book represents something of a
departure, both for Schmidt and for Google.
To date, the firms vision of the future has
largely concerned whizz-bang technological wonders, such as driverless cars
or hi-tech glasses that project a computer display in your peripheral
vision.
The New Digital Age does contain its
share of techno-dazzle: the opening chapters discuss the elimination of
pesky charging cables, the proliferation of robots and holograms, and even
haircuts that will finally be automated and machine-precise (I love the
finally, as if a hue and cry has been growing for years against slapdash
barbers).
Yet at heart, the book is a sober examination of what current technological
trends mean for our future.
That includes,
-
the ability of repressive governments to
turn every smartphone into a bugging device
-
the breakdown of privacy
-
the danger of countries setting up their
own, censored versions of the internet
-
the threat of hackers, terrorists and
cyber-warfare
-
at root, the fact that people and
governments will have to function in both the real and virtual
worlds, which will not just overlap but collide
The book, says Schmidt, is an attempt to get
the conversation going about these issues, to foster solutions.
The reception to Google's London head office
Some reviewers of the book have, I point out, argued that it ignores the
elephant in the room, namely Googles own role, and the amount of power it
is steadily accruing over our lives.
But for Schmidt and Cohen, there is essentially
no distinction between Googles good and the worlds. Giving more people
more information makes their lives better, and makes Google richer and more
able to help more people.
This is a virtuous circle from which, in their
view, everyone benefits: not just in terms of free email accounts or mapping
software, but greater connectivity, transparency and personal freedom.
Google is more than a business, says
Schmidt.
Google is a belief system. And we believe
passionately in the open internet model. So all of the answers to the
questions that we give are, at the core, about the benefits of a free
and open internet.
This near-evangelical approach explains the
pairs preferred solution to many of the worlds problems: in effect, more
Google.
Recently, they visited North Korea: they were
widely criticized, not least because the regime could depict them as
decadent capitalists paying due homage to Kim Jong-un.
Schmidt accepts that such propaganda was
inevitable, but argues that getting the dictator to open up the internet is,
the single best way to fix the problems of
North Korea - and adds that if you ask, you might just get.
Others, however, do not see Google so kindly.
This week, Schmidt was embroiled in a nasty row
about tax avoidance, due to accusations that - in seeming violation of its
famous pledge not to be evil - Google sold online advertising in London
but booked it in Dublin, creating billions in revenues but paying just £2
million a year in corporation tax.
In defence, Schmidt points to Googles record of job creation and
investment:
I understand that people are frustrated
but this is how international tax regimes work, and we have to follow
the rules.
He is similarly robust when I ask whether he
thinks his company has undue political influence.
Doesnt the Guardian, and the Telegraph,
and the Times? I think I could argue that the press has more impact on
politics than corporations.
And what about people who call for Google and co
to do more to regulate what people - especially children - can see on the
net?
The core problem, he says, is that the
world is full of people who would like to take 99 per cent of the
information thats on the internet, and eliminate 1 per cent. Everyone
has their own thing they dont like.
More broadly, Schmidt and Cohen do have plenty
of warnings about the way things are going - for instance, over governments
tendency, even in democracies, to increase surveillance of the population.
You have to fight for your privacy, or you
will lose it, Schmidt insists. Whenever theres a conflict, the logic
of security will trump the right to privacy.
He also talks passionately about the need to
balance entrepreneurial freedom and regulation, citing the way that the US
railroad system was mired in corruption when it was left to private
interests, and starved of innovation when the government cracked down.
Yet at heart, Googles executive chairman is something of an optimist.
He doesnt subscribe, for example, to the idea
that technology is somehow transforming our nature: the internet, he says,
is just another tool for empowering
individuals.
I mention Time magazines recent suggestion that
the webs delivery of what you want, when you want, is turning young people
into narcissists, and he makes a pained face.
To argue that this generation is different
is to ignore history, he insists.
Read the coverage about the Kings Road in
the Sixties, and the pop revolution. You want to talk about narcissism?
Those people all grew up, and theyre all 65 or 70 years old, and they
all seem to have perfectly fine lives.
Despite all the challenges that we face - both
in the developed and developing world - Schmidt retains a supreme
self-confidence that both he and Google are going the right way about
serving them.
Indeed, after the book tour, he and Cohen have a
one-line itinerary: implement its ideas.
This is what I do, says Schmidt.
Im not going to stop. I mean, I really do
believe this stuff, and I do believe its important. In whatever number
of years I have on earth, I think that promoting the values of free
expression, the openness of the internet, thats the best use of my
time.
As I leave, hes inquiring about the itinerary
for his trip to Downing Street - bracken stains and all.
