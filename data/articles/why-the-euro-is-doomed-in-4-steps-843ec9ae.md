It's the gold standard...
minus the shiny
rocks.
We're going to need a bigger acronym.
In the beginning, it was just the "Greek
debt crisis". Then markets realized Portugal, Ireland, Italy, and Spain
were in bad shape too, and the PIIGS (or
GIIPS) were born.
But now Cyprus and Slovenia have run into trouble
as well, giving us the... SIC(K)
PIGS? At this rate, we're going to have to buy a vowel soon,
assuming Estonia doesn't end up needing a bailout.
The Euro crisis is entering its fourth year,
and, sorry world, this won't be its last. Now, its long periods of
boredom have gotten a bit longer, and its moments of sheer
financial terror a bit less terrifying ever since the European Central
Bank (ECB) promised to do "whatever
it takes" to save the common currency.
But, as Cyprus and Slovenia
show, the battle for the Euro isn't over yet. Not even close.
Here's the Cliff Notes version of the Euro
crisis. The Euro zone doesn't have the fiscal or banking unions it needs
to make monetary union work, and it's not close to changing that. In the
meantime, the euro's continuing flaws continue to suck countries into
crisis. And their politics get radicalized.
Most recently, Cyprus was
forced to accept a
bailout and bail-in, because its too-big-to-save banks made some
horrendously bad bets on Greek bonds.
Slovenia looks like it could next
on the Euro-bailout tour, because, as
Dylan Matthews of the Washington Post points out, its
too-big-to-save-ish banks made some horrendously bad bets on its own
companies. Now, banks make bad bets all the time, but those bad bets can
bankrupt you as a country if you don't have your own central bank. Like
Euro countries.
Of course, this "diabolic
loop" between weak banks and weak sovereigns isn't the only problem
in Euroland. The common currency has plenty of other flaws.
Here's why
the Euro, as it's currently constructed, is a doomsday device for mass
bankruptcy. (How's that for solidarity?).
The Euro zone isn't what economists call
an "optimal currency area".
In other words, it was a bad idea. Its
different members are different enough that they should have
different monetary policies. But they don't. They have the ECB
setting a single policy for all 17 of them.
That's a particular
problem for southern Europe now, because their wages are uncompetitively high relative to northern European ones, and the ECB
isn't helping them out.
There are two ways to fix this
intra-Euro competitiveness gap. Either northern European wages rise
faster than normal while southern wages stay flat, or northern
European wages grow normally while southern European wages fall.
It's the difference between a bit more inflation or not - in other
words, between looser ECB policy or the status quo. Now, it might
not sound like it really matters which option they choose, but it
very much does. Falling wages make it harder to pay back debts that
don't fall, setting off a vicious circle into economic oblivion.
The ECB apparently prefers pushing more and more countries into oblivion
with too tight money than risk anything resembling more inflation.
Austerity has been a
complete disaster.
It's actually increased debt burdens across
southern Europe, because it's reduced growth more than it's reduced
borrowing costs. And now northern Europe is getting in on the act.
France (which is really somewhere in between "southern" and
"northern") just
missed its deficit target, and is set to slash more; the
Netherlands has put through
contentious tax hikes and spending cuts, even as its economy has
shrunk; and even Germany is contemplating
new budget-saving measures.
In other words, the Euro has become
an austerity suicide pact.
Excluding Germany, just over half of all
Euro trade is with each other.
But with bad policy pushing southern
Europe into depression and northern Europe towards recession, Euro
zone countries can't afford to buy as much stuff from each other.
That adds a degree of difficulty to recovery for southern European
countries that need to export their way out of trouble. As you can
see in the chart below from Eurostat,
intra-Euro zone trade has stagnated the past few years after
rebounding from its post-crash depths.
The Euro zone's weak links
are dragging the rest down - but only because the rest refuse to
pull the weak ones up.
4. Too Much Financial Interconnection
Other country's problems can quickly
become your own if your banks own their bonds.
Especially if your banks are bigger than
your economy. That's the lesson Cyprus learned the very hard way
after its banks
loaded up on Greek debt in 2010, only to get wiped out a year
later.
The Financial Times has a
great infographic (that you should play around with) on which
country's banks are exposed to which other country's debt across the
Euro zone.
As you can see below, any kind of
Italian restructuring would be tremendously bad for French banks.
The Euro is the gold standard minus the
shiny rocks.
Both force countries to give up their
ability to fight recessions in return for fixed exchange rates and open
capital flows. But giving up the ability to fight recessions just makes
it easier for recessions to turn into depressions.
And that puts all of
the pressure on wages to adjust down when a shock hits - the most
painful and destructive way of doing things.
But the gold standard had an even bigger
design flaw than creating depressions. That was perpetuating
depressions. Under the rules of the game, countries short on gold were
supposed to raise interest rates, which would push down wages, and push
up exports. More exports would mean more gold, and then lower interest
rates.
But there was an asymmetry.
Countries needed gold to create money, but
countries didn't need to create money if they had gold. During the Great
Depression, the U.S. and
France sucked up most of the world's gold, but didn't turn it into
money out of fear of nonexistent inflation.
Countries that needed gold needed to push
down wages even more to make their exports competitive - not that there
were any booming markets for them to export to, due to the
self-inflicted economics wounds of the U.S. and France. Instead, the
depression just fed on itself.
The Euro suffers from a similar asymmetry.
Debtor-Euro countries are to cut wages and deficits, but creditor-Euro
countries aren't forced to increase wages and deficits. Perversely, the
opposite. In other words, northern Europe isn't doing enough to offset
the demand destruction in southern Europe. And it's sinking them all.
Even worse, this slow-motion collapse is
turning loans that would have otherwise been good into losses - losses
that force bailouts and faster collapses. But, to be clear, this isn't
only a problem for the periphery.
As the U.S. and France found out in the
1930s, it's generally not a good idea to force your customers into
bankruptcy. That just creates depression without end - until the gold
(or Euro) standard ends. It's no coincidence that the countries that
ditched the gold standard first recovered from the Great Depression
first.
History doesn't need to repeat, or even
rhyme. Europe doesn't have to keep crucifying itself on a cross of
Euros, the gold standard of the 21st-century.
The euro's northern bloc could decide
to let the ECB do more. Or it could decide to start spending
more. Or not.
Eurocrats seem content to do just enough to keep
everything from falling apart, and nothing more. It's one part
inflationphobia, and another part strategy.
Indeed, it's how they try to keep the
pressure on the southern bloc to push through unpopular labor market
reforms. But doing enough today eventually won't be enough tomorrow if
the southern bloc doesn't have any hope of recovering within the Euro.
The politics will turn against the common currency long before that.
By that point, Europe won't need an acronym
anymore.
