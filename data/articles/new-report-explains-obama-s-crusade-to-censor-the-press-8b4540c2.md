The non-governmental organization (NGO) Human
Rights Watch (HRW) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
have released a report (With
Liberty to Monitor All - How Large-Scale U.S. Surveillance is Harming
Journalism, Law, and American Democracy) explaining the damage
caused by U.S. government surveillance agencies such as the National
Security Agency (NSA).
The report states:
"Journalists told us that officials are
substantially less willing to be in contact with the press, even with
regard to unclassified matters or personal opinions, than they were even
a few years ago.
Journalists and their sources, as well as
lawyers and their clients, are changing their behavior in ways that
undermine basic rights and corrode democratic processes."
More than 92 journalists, attorneys, as well as
current and former U.S. government officials were interviewed for the report.
Alex Sinha, author of the report and
fellow at the HRW contends that,
"the U.S. holds itself out as a model of
freedom and democracy, but its own surveillance programs are threatening
the values it claims to represent."
Sinha said:
"They're not in general convinced that there
is a chilling effect of the sort that we were talking about."
Both the ACLU and HRW call for the reform of the
Obama administration and Congressional approval of such surveillance
agencies and their ability to monitor average citizens across the world
without clear and legal purpose for doing so.
Earlier this year, citizen journalism was given
another prompt toward legitimacy with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling that bloggers have the same 1st Amendment rights as established
journalists when involved in a defamation of character suit; as long as the
issue is of public concern.
The outcome of this case establishes the fact
that protections afforded the news media are not exclusive to their realm,
but are also extended to citizen journalists and bloggers.
Most importantly, the judges found that,
"under the 1st Amendment, it doesn't matter
whether the person accused of defamation is a professional journalist,
an amateur whistle-blower or a crank with a Web page."
This case highlights the findings in 1974
wherein the U.S. Supreme Court
wrote that freedom of the press applies to everyone
- not only
journalists.
Senator Dianne Feinstein
commented last year
that the new Federal Media Shield would guarantee 1st Amendment protection
to federally recognized journalists who are "real reporters" - not those
"blogger" journalists in alternative media.
Feinstein claimed that the 1st Amendment is a
privilege, not an inalienable right as defined by our U.S. Constitution.
In 2013,
the mainstream media complained about
pictures of President Obama that
are not allowed to be made public.
Because images of the president are used by
independent and alternative media, as well as corporate-sponsored, the way
in which Obama is portrayed is important.
In controlling access to images of the
president, this is one way of making sure Obama's image remains intact.
Photographs end up in the hands of independent and alternative media which
make the president look bad.
The
Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) released a report showing that
President Obama is on a
crusade to subvert the freedom of the press and
democracy.
Leonard Downie, professor of journalism at
Arizona State University (ASU) and author of the report for CPJ said:
"Journalists and transparency advocates say
the White House curbs routine disclosure of information and deploys its
own media to evade scrutiny by the press.
Aggressive prosecution of
leakers of classified information and broad electronic surveillance
programs deter government sources from speaking to journalists."
Downie pointed out that the Obama administration
has a,
"war on leaks and other efforts to control
information are the most aggressive I've seen since the Nixon
administration, when I was one of the editors involved in The Washington
Post's investigation of Watergate."
Journalists interviewed for the report conveyed
the fact that the,
"U.S. government has conducted more than twice
as many criminal prosecutions for alleged leaks of classified
information than all the previous administrations combined."
The Obama administration has taken internal
leaks seriously with the
implementation of aggressive measures under the
Insider Threat Program (ITP)
that conducts surveillance on journalists to prevent whistleblowing by any
means necessary.
According to the Pentagon, an "insider threat"
is defined as an employee,
"with a clearance who 'wittingly or
unwittingly' harms 'national security interests' through 'unauthorized
disclosure, data modification, espionage, terrorism, or kinetic actions
resulting in loss or degradation of resources or capabilities'."
The ITP is under high security to ensure that
leverage for blackmail and coercion are utilized to the fullest extent and
power by this current administration to mitigate potential leaks with
co-workers spying on each other, keeping profiles for future use and the
broad spectrum surveillance that remains intact long after a subject is no
longer an immediate threat for future consideration.
The Obama administration made public a portion
of this initiative with the
presidential memorandum entitled, "National Insider Threat Policy and
Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs" wherein
leaks are considered treasonous acts against the current administration.
The reward based system set up by the Obama
administration gave coverage and protection to those whistleblowers who
"followed the proper channels" when leaking out information and paved the
way for the ITP to punish other who did not allow the federal government to
control their leaks.
Under ITP, Obama asserted that intelligence
agencies would follow a subject for years after they had "defected" from the
U.S. government to determine if highly classified documents had been acquired
and could be released to media outlets or the general public.
By using public opinion against the potential leak, the ITP is designed to
discredit the whistleblower.
