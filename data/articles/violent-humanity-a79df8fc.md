The list of countries and cities disintegrating
or unraveling because of violence, economic and political turmoil, lack of
food and civil unrest is growing. Human violence is a very important subject
at this particular moment in time.
Violence has 'always' been a basic part of human
nature and we have a lot to be ashamed of.
It is a shame to find out that the most dangerous place for women and
children is actually in their own homes - homes being the place where we
actually find the most violence. Family life in our insane civilization has
turned into a nightmare for way too many people, but then again we have had
the same problems throughout history.
In the first part of this essay we will talk about the violence happening
out there but at the end we will come back full circle to the many forms of
intimate violence that betrays and abuses our deepest vulnerabilities. One
would be astounded at the spectrum of human violence and how well that
violence can be hidden.
Some of the cruelest, most violent men in
history are actually the ones who started the war on drugs - a war destined
to destroy not only huge segments of society but entire nations as well.
Mexico is a nightmare of unprecedented dimensions unfolding in Americas own
backyard. Mexico is descending into a bottomless pit of drug violence and
civil war. Nearly a
dozen people were shot to death in the Pacific coast
resort of Acapulco.
Authorities in the central state of Mexico
arrested a suspected drug-gang leader who
confessed to directly carrying out
300 homicides and ordering 600 others.
Governments & Cruelty
Syrian security forces swept through neighborhoods in a restive central city
firing machine guns and pulling people from their homes in a series of
arrests and killings.
On the last day of July 2011, Syrian tanks,
firing shells and machineguns, stormed the city of Hama on Sunday, killing
80 civilians. The Syrian president is just one more madman who thinks he has
the right to have his men going around killing hundreds upon hundreds of
people as the rest of the world watches in pathetic silence.
Two weeks later on Sunday, August 14, 2011,
Syrian gunboats firing heavy
machine guns pounded impoverished districts of Latakia, killing at least 19
people in a renewed assault on the Mediterranean coastal city, activists
said. As the gunships blasted waterfront districts, ground troops backed by
tanks and security agents stormed several neighborhoods.
The sharp crackle of machine-gun fire and loud
explosions could be heard across the city. Now the bullets are raining down
on the people of Yemen.
Dont get too comfortable - one day this kind of violence could come to a
city near you. Even if you live in the first world and only have the
occasional madman running around shooting people, someday it could be the
police, national guard, homeland security,
FEMA and even the army doing much
the same.
Last month a riot tore through parts of north Londons
deprived Tottenham
neighborhood casting a pall over Britains capital.
Eight officers were hospitalized during the
rampage, with rioters torching a double-decker bus, destroying patrol cars
and trashing a shopping mall.
This is just a glimpse into the abyss,
former Metropolitan Police Commander John OConnor told Sky News
television Sunday.
Thousands of rioters took to the streets in
China, with some
smashing and burning vehicles, after a city official injured
a female cyclist. Last month, hundreds of people in another
southern Chinese city rioted after a policeman was reported
to have beaten up a one-legged fruit seller. The seller, who
had apparently protested against the confiscation of his
cart for illegal parking, later died of his injuries.
Sino Daily
Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said about the
shooting massacre in Norway,
A paradise island has been transformed into
a hell.
Erik Kursetgjerde described the panic on Utoeya
when the gunman began shooting,
I heard screams. I heard people begging for
their lives and I heard shots. He just blew them away. The killer,
dressed as a policeman, would tell people to come over: Its okay,
youre safe, were coming to help you. And then I saw about 20 people
come toward him and he shot them at close range.
Some Hate Love
In an
Afghan love story that flouted dominant traditions of arranged
marriages and close family scrutiny, a romance between two teenagers of
different ethnicities brought the beastly side out of these kids families
and neighbors.
A group of men spotted the couple riding
together in a car, yanked them into the road and began to interrogate the
boy and girl.
-
Why were they together?
-
What right had they?
An angry crowd of 300 surged around them,
calling them adulterers and demanding that they be stoned to death or
hanged.
When security forces swooped in and rescued the couple, the mobs anger
exploded. They overwhelmed the local police, set fire to cars and stormed a
police station. The riot, which lasted for hours, ended with one man dead, a
police station charred and the two teenagers, Halima Mohammedi and her
boyfriend, Rafi Mohammed, confined to juvenile prison.
Ms. Mohammedis uncle visited her in jail to say
she had shamed the family and promised that they would kill her once she was
released.
Understanding Violence
Dr.
Aletha Solter, Ph.D., founder and director of the
Aware Parenting
Institute says,
There are two basic conditions that produce
violent tendencies in human beings. One condition is that the person has
been hurt. A child who is spanked, hit, beaten, or threatened with
violence will have a tendency to become violent himself.
Sexual abuse and emotional neglect are also
hurts that can lead to violent tendencies. The accumulation of minor
hurts (stress) can lead to violent behavior as well. The anxieties,
disappointments, and frustrations of childhood can build up and cause a
child to hit or bite.
The second basic condition is less well understood.
The person has not been allowed to release
the emotions resulting from the hurts. He has unresolved and unexpressed
feelings about what he has experienced. Only then will he have a
tendency to be violent towards others. Being the victim of violence and
other distressing experiences breeds violence in the child only when the
emotions are blocked and repressed.
When this situation occurs, violence toward
self or others is almost an inevitable outcome. Violence is a distorted
expression of the persons rage or terror in an environment where it is
not safe to reveal or release strong feelings, continued Solter.
Violence is tolerated and even glorified in most
industrialized countries and is culturally linked to appropriate male
behavior.
One of the greatest hidden forms of violence is
the mass
drugging of children. Yet its perpetrated within schools,
doctors offices, foster homes and juvenile facilities daily.
Dr.
John Monahan, Ph.D., Psychologist and
Professor, School of Law, University of Virginia-Charlottesville, asks why
so many Americans are afraid to walk home alone at night.
He says,
Many biological factors have been nominated
as candidates for causes of violence.
Hormones like testosterone, transmitters in
the brain like serotonin, and blood abnormalities like hypoglycemia are
only a few that have been mentioned. Biological factors do not have to
be hereditary. They could be caused by a head injury, poor nutrition, or
environmental events, such as exposure to lead paint.
Compared with Japan, a nation of roughly
comparable industrialization with cities much more crowded than ours,
the U.S. homicide rate is over five times higher, the rape rate is 22
times higher, and the armed robbery rate is an astounding 114 times
higher.
To prevent violence, we must first, stop
perpetrating violence on children.
This means no spanking or hitting. It is important to know that children
need the most love and attention when they act the least deserving of it.
Dr. Aletha Solter
When we begin to look at domestic violence we can see what brutes we humans
can be.

Pharmaceutical-induced violence
In 2006,
David Crespi, a former banking executive with no criminal
record or history of violence, killed his twin five-year-old daughters,
stabbing them multiple times with a kitchen knife.
Crespi was taking
Prozac when he killed his
daughters, along with the sleeping pill
Ambien.
Modern psychiatrys love affair with pharmaceutical drugs has turned psychiatrists into killers.
Psychiatric medications are known to cause
extremely violent thoughts and behavior in young males. Ten percent of
Americans over age six take antidepressants.
In the United States we have seen similar shootings by men with a
history of treatment with psychotropic drugs - typically SSRI
antidepressants. These shootings have three things in common:
-
the shooters are young males
-
the shooters exhibit a mind-numbed
disconnect with reality
-
the shooters have a history of taking
psychiatric medications
An estimated 2.2 million Americans are
hospitalized each year for adverse drug reactions. Over 100,000 die from
them.
Violence is normal for our race though most of
it is hidden from plain sight.
I am afraid that we are going into a new Dark
Age where violence will grow exponentially again as it has before. The
police and security forces around the world have trained heavily this past
decade preparing for civil violence and disobedience.
What will we do to protect our families?
Most of us fail miserably when it comes to protecting our loved ones from
the violence of the main institutions of civilization, from governments and
companies who love to bring harm to others with their poisons. Ninety
percent of parents cannot even utter a cry of protest as the pediatric
doctors inject vaccines laced with dangerous heavy metals and toxic
chemicals.
How many Americans understand and complain about
the violence of
water fluoridation?
Somehow we have left ourselves vulnerable to
massive abuse and violence.
