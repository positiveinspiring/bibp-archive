# Contact by a Rothschild's Family Descendant?

Hi Ben,
I thought I'd give you a little bit of an intro cause I think you might
be confused. The banking one... yes my Uncle Evelyn & Cousin Nathaniel
are a naughty pair but have disowned me after all I've been doing - no
inheritance for me!
I'm actually 51%
Anunnaki (my mothers side - don't ask
how the extra 1% got there cause it's cosmic). OK, OK, OK... you might
enjoy reading some of my notes - all my original work, very tongue in
cheek.
Truth is I crash landed here and have infiltrated all the top families
and elite people of the world (especially bored housewives) just by
being very PSI and amusing them all... everyone loves a family argument
and gossip if it's not their family... and have just started spreading
truth, information, disinformation and hilarity over the last few months
now I've got comfortable and in with the crowd.
The idea is not to tell people THE TRUTH
(cause who knows exactly what that is), the idea is to get in front of
their friends and others along the way and get them thinking and
discussing. I have a split-personality where one minute I can be gunning
for the truth, and the next I can be pro-NWO... all good fun to keep
people thinking and keep them on their toes. My wall is a melting pot of
people and ideas.
I could just be a useless eater peasant myself using the name for all we
know - however I think you'll find some love & light within me.
I feel a bit bad actually Benjamin, I've always been a bit cautious of
you because of just how you managed to get close to The Rockefellers...
I think I pre-judged you, however truth is only person I know I can
trust is me - and you probably feel the same about yourself.
That's another running joke how
ROTHSCHILD >
ROCKEFELLER just like LOVE > FEAR; damn
I love knocking those new money Rockefeller fools - they make us
Rothschild's look so so smart!
I just don't care anymore, I've been
investigating the NWO for far too long and decided to do
something totally original and different and take the info to people who
would not normally look for it, rather than just set up another ranting
blog or whatever.
I've been receiving death threats and harassment so I know I'm doing
something right. I think I'll be revealing myself soon cause I've become
quite influential on here and have lots of top contacts. I might get
shot for all I've done but I think it's been a hell of a ride.
One guy I don't like is Alex Jones, he doesn't speak about some
things and also to me he seems about the FEAR & money more than
anything.
Pleased to meet you Ben, thanks for accepting me and I'm willing to
start at 0 with you and judge you from what I see.
Namaste
