To better understand the uprising in Tunisia and the crisis unfolding in
Egypt, it is necessary to understand the historical context of the
situation.
During World War I, the British manufactured the phenomenon of Arab Revolt
to breakdown the Ottoman Empire, which controlled most of the Middle East.
The so-called Arab Revolt was lead by Lawrence of Arabia, an on-duty British
officer.
The flag of the Arab revolt bears a triangle
(below video).
But once the Ottoman Empire was dismantled, these regions were not given to
Arabs or to councils representing Arabs. They were quickly transferred to
certain secretive families within the Arabs, who may be neither Arabs nor
Muslims (though they do pretend).
These families went on the establish some
of the most repressive governments in the entire history of the region. A
good example are the rulers of Jordan and Libya. The rulers of Jordan now
exclusively marry into Western ruling elite.
Libya has such close secret
ties with the British ruling elite that it seems that the Lockerbie bombing
was outsourced to Libya instead of the MI6.
But since this transfer of power was done too fast and over too big a
region,
the Illuminati in the Western world could not transfer all of Middle
East to their cousins in the Middle East.
In some cases, they allowed local
powers to serve as clients of Western powers.
Now, the
Powers That Be no longer see the necessity of such client states
run by local powers and are transferring them to the direct rule of pretend
Muslims and pretend Arabs who have secret bloodlines that branch off the
Western ruling elite.
Is the unrest in Egypt and Tunisia a part of this
operation?
We are observing that the unrest is very region-specific. It does not seem
to be spreading to places like Jordan and Libya, which are already under the
thumb of the Powers That Be.
There is the case of German/Swedish
snipers/hunters being caught in Tunisia (below video).
The Western media appears to be
magnifying the crisis (this is
the same media that told you that USA was
attacked by Bin Laden on
9-11).
Like all revolutions, the mobs only seem to
be content in accomplishing a shake up of the existing power structure. Who
gets to inherit the power is not questioned.
In the case of Egypt, Mohamed ElBaradei is already being
touted as a new leader for Egypt.
ElBaradei won a Nobel prize after the Iraq War. Discerning readers will note
that Nobel prizes usually recognize those who have done immense service for
the Cabal.
And what was ElBaradeis service to the Cabal? Contrary to
popular perception, ElBaradei facilitated the Iraq Invasion!
This is best
described by Gulf News Amir Taheri
as follows:
Had Al Baradei, and his overall boss at the
time Hans Blix, come out with a clear statement that Iraq did not
possess any Weapons of Mass Destructions (WMDs), they might have made it
impossible for the US-led coalition to invade Iraq.
On the other hand, had they reported that Saddam should take specific
measures to prove that he had dismantled his arsenal of WMDs, and the
political and economic structures that could rebuild them at short
notice, they might have persuaded the despot to take the threat of war
seriously and transfer power to a caretaker administration in Baghdad.
In either case, a clear position from the
inspectors might have prevented war.
Did ElBaradei facilitate
the 2003 US invasion of Iraq
through his fishtail
reports on Iraq's nuclear program?
Al Baradei and Blix, however, chose the worst option: they equivocated,
thus encouraging Saddam in his defiance while leaving the US and its
allies no option but war to enforce the UN resolutions.
In other words, ElBaradei facilitated
unwarranted suspicion towards Iraq.
Of course, ElBaradei did many Nobel
things, like dismissing WMD reports that were outright forgeries, and these
have been exaggerated. But his role in
the IAEA being used as a pawn to cast
suspicion towards Iraq has been all but forgotten.
Prior to the invasion of
Iraq, ElBaradei promised he would resign as director of the IAEA if an
illegitimate invasion of Iraq was launched. But he didnt.
ElBaradei also
insists that the IAEA is not a stooge of
the CIA, despite the fact that the IAEA doesnt seem to mind Israels atomic program. Interestingly,
ElBaradeis most recent stint at the IAEA was involved assuaging suspicions
about Irans nuclear program (Iran is already with the Cabal).
If ElBaradei indeed has the blood of the Iraqis
on his hands, the violence in Egypt would be picnic in comparative terms.
Foreign Snipers caught in
Tunisia with their equipment.
Their bags were full of
catridges.
We were later told that they
were "hunters."
In the case of Tunisia, we know that countries that are at the forefront of
the New World Order, such as France, were quick to deny exile to the former
President of Tunisia.
Was this inhospitality out of sympathy for the
Tunisian people? Those that know the history of French involvement in North
Africa know the answer. It is obvious that the Tunisian President was
suddenly no longer a preferred client.
We are now learning that the United
States State Department is now reviewing the two billion dollar bakhsheesh
that it has been giving yearly to the Egyptian rulers for signing the Camp
David agreement that made Egypt the first Arab country to recognize Israel.
I am not implying that the rulers of Tunisia and Egypt deserve to be
sympathized.
To the contrary, one can observe their naiveté in trusting
Western powers and Western Intelligence Agencies. Little do they know that
being good clients does not exempt them from the predatory designs of their
Western counterparts. In fact, the more willingness they show to become the
perfect thugocratic client state of Western powers, the more susceptible
they become to overthrow by the Powers That Be.
I will show two historical
cases to demonstrate the same.
The Iranian Revolution
of 1970
While the Iranian Revolution did represent popular sentiment, it was more on
the lines of an Islamicized French Revolution (mob rule, executions, secret
courts, destruction and displacement of the former ruling class etc.)
The
revolutionaries managed to create a powerful police state that now
spearheads the clash of civilizations rhetoric prescribed by the Powers That
Be. The secret ties of the Western ruling elite with some of the
revolutionaries
has been documented and needs no repetition here.
The most tragic part of this revolution was the naiveté of the rulers of
Iran. Reza Shah, a cavalry soldier, was brought to power by the British to
supplant the
Qajar dynasty that ruled over Iran (Mossadegh had blood ties to
this great dynasty).
Reza and his successor, Reza Pahlavi assumed that the
continuation of their rule depended upon continued subservience to Western
Powers as operators of a client state. Little did they know that the Powers
That Be saw them only as temporary placeholders until Iran was consolidated
under a new regime that was to play a critical role in advancing the Clash
of Civilizations agenda.
Reza turned over the police, intelligence and
economic affairs of his country to his Western friends who promptly set
out to use them to create the conditions necessary for the revolution. In
fact, the revolution would have never succeeded were it not for the measures
pioneered by Rezas Western friends.
Once the revolution was underway, Reza
was even denied exile in Western countries. Apparently, he was no longer a
preferred client.
The Powers That Be now had Iran. They didnt need a client
anymore. Even in exile, members of the Pahlavi dynasty still saw themselves
as likely client candidates for Iran, much to the irritation of the Powers
That Be, who secretly opposed them at every turn. One major prince
associated with this dynasty has committed
suicide in Boston.
If only the Pahlavis better understood that Western powers were no longer interested in
their client services.
The 1977 Egyptian
Bread Riots
In 1970, an opportunist, Anwar Sadat, became President of Egypt. He be
believed that he could assure his perpetual survival by kowtowing to Israel
and the United States.
He went to great lengths to ensure just this, even
humiliating the entire Arab World by signing the Camp David agreement.
Little did he know that the same Powers he was kowtowing to were also
actively seeking to replace him with their own people. In 1977, Sadat
naively assumed that opening up Egypts economy to the West would bring in
Western capital.
The
World Bank moved in, insisting that he remove subsidies
on food and divert that money towards the World Bank instead, so that he
could get loans. Sadat could not comprehend that he was financing his own
overthrow, and naively towed along.
What followed were
the Bread Riots in
which 800 Egyptians were killed and Sadat was almost overthrown.
Sadat
managed to quickly cancel the World Bank policies before he was overthrown.
But the Powers That Be never give up. Sadat was assassinated by an Islamist
group, although it seems that this event did not bring up the desired
shakeup (and therefore the current crisis).
There is no doubt that those who carried on the assassination were authentic
jihadists who had deep grudges with Sadat. But it appears that there were
certain secretive and shadowy elements who coordinated the assassination,
who at the same time managed to avoid the limelight.
One such shadowy
operative,
Ayman Zawahiri is believed to have procured the weapons used in
Sadats assassination, although he avoided any involvement in the actual
operation. He later infiltrated Bin Ladens organization and succeeded in
introducing a clash of civilizations rhetoric, which jeopardized the
operations of Bin Laden. Although it did help bolster the case of Bin Laden
being involved in
the events of 9-11.
After 9-11, Zawahiri released a number
of videos gloating how his group carried the attacks, and special messages
for his followers.
Unlike the
Bin Laden gloat videos which were never fully
authenticated, Zawahiris videos appear to be authentic, suggesting he has
survived (or was allowed to survive) the American onslaught and continues to
infiltrate Jihadist groups.
Such videos serve little purpose other than
being a viral marketing campaign for the necessity of the
War on Terror.
Like a true operative of Western Intelligence, Zawahiri would go
globetrotting prior to 9-11 on multiple fake passports, to places as far off
as Thailand and Switzerland.
He was believed to have also worked for Russian
Intelligence (to suppress the Chechen jihad) and Iranian Intelligence (which
was an adversary of the Taliban).
Conclusion
Tunisia and Egypt have always faced real unrest.
But the failure of their
client rulers to address the unrest has resulted in outside forces hijacking
dissent to stampede in their
New World Order. I dont expect the remaining
client states in the Middle East to suddenly put their peoples interests
before themselves. But at least, in the interest of common sense, they
should be able to distinguish between friend and foe.
Serving as a client
state for Western Powers is no longer as lucrative as it once was. It can be
downright dangerous, as Western Powers are now bent on supplanting clients
with people straight from their think tanks.
If only the client rulers of
the Middle East knew that think tanks and intelligence agencies based in
Western countries were bigger sources of mayhem than the unarmed protestors
on the streets.
