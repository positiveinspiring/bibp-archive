# The Anglo Saxon Mission - The Timeline - Letter from a Whistleblower

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_endgame12.htm

Background
By the time I had become aware of the Timeline I had already traveled all
over the world with the UK military and was involved in many conflicts, and
had witnessed many mind changing events some of which are difficult describe
in any sensible manner.
One the most difficult events to rationalize was a gathering that took place
in 1975 that involved Admiral
Hill-Norton, who was then, I believe, Chairman
of the NATO Committee. I cannot go into the detail of this since to do so
might compromise the Official Secrets Act. Suffice to say this event was
pivotal and key to later events in providing evidence for the existence of
the Anglo-Saxon Mission or better described as the Timeline.
Therefore, no more can be publicly said about
this event, other than to state that this Timeline was very much in
existence 35 years ago, backed up by a very creditable insider, later
referred to as CW and from what I witnessed personally.
During 1980s, due to certain personal career events, which I am not yet
able to disclose, I could establish beyond any simple suspicion, that a
future wartime government of the UK will be conservative, right wing in
nature, and of high ranking military office, not civilian, with the officer
cadre from all 3 services properly inducted to be in obedient support. I
felt at the time that we would soon be in an extended state world wide armed
conflict, where this type of totalitarian/military Government would be put
in place.
I continued on with my military career and was now project working with
various military contractors such as BAE, Westland, and Plessey & Marconi
Systems. It was during this time that I was introduced into the future naval
weapons programs then running in the late 80s and early 90s. However, by
then, I was totally disillusioned and really did feel that ultra-right wing
hands were at hard at work manipulating people and events.
Again, what CW had told me (CW was
an insider,
known since 1975 and whose identity still needs to be protected) previously
told me came back with more solidity than I could have imagined.
In effect CW was turning out to be right, and in effect, I had a major
mindset change as I knew that everything I was told was based on ordinary
people being kept compliant and ignorant.
Cape Wrath Scotland
Anyway, these future weapons in themselves, I must say, were not remarkable.
They are of the kind anyone could read about in the glossy monthly defense
industry magazines.
However, due to my combat experience I was sent
to various weapon testing ranges in the UK, mostly at Cape Wrath in the
North of Scotland. My job, with many others of my rank, was to conduct range
tracking exercises against aerial targets. At the time we were using
development stage surveillance and fire control radars to see if we could
detect and lock-up small very fast moving targets coming in from high
altitude.
We used a whole series of targets from fast jets
to unmanned drones, to artillery shells.
On one occasion, during these range trials, I was on one weapons desk and a
BAE civilian technician (in the military we called such civilian
technicians, Boffins) was on another weapons desk with much different
equipment. This time there was much more pre-exercise setting up than usual
before the target run in. So it was some time before we got the normal,
Range Clear, Start Recording to commence the exercise. My job, as always,
was to get the best possible use out of the equipment for analysis.
This is where things started to get weird. The target, whatever it was,
since I wasnt told, was not detected on the equipment I was operating.
However, the BAE technician, the Boffin, did see the target on his
equipment and was voice reporting target information. To cut a long story
short: The target came in from an extremely high altitude, which I later
deduced (time/speed/distance) had to be in excess of 200 miles, i.e., coming
in from outside the earth atmosphere and at an incomprehensible velocity,
and most certainly outside spectrum of the kit I was operating.
Now, this wasnt some sort of UFO as the ground
operators were actually talking, clearly, to someone inside the target
throughout the exercise.
Later the Boffin said,
dont worry, its one of ours! I recall
saying, Thank f**k for that! because I didnt see a Scooby!
He said,
Well, you were not meant to see anything and if you did, then we would
have had some serious snags.
Later, I thought, I had been engaged in a
tracking exercise against a missile with an extremely low radar echoing
area, launched from a platform in orbit.
This was not so since, as I discovered, the
target was most definitely piloted, maneuvering, and came to an abrupt stop
at the end of the range. I instinctively knew better to ask anymore
questions about this. Instead I was more resolved to see if I could pick the
bloody thing up on my kit as a matter of professional pride. I never
managed to pick it up.
We conducted several more runs against this type
of target and it sounded as if there was more than one of them and not just
the same target repeating the runs.
You will realize by now I am taking about something akin to what is termed
Black Projects. The type of target that I was engaged against was
apparently over 30 years in development and this is by the early 90s; under
joint project control by BAE and other well known defense contractors.
These
targets are known only to a select few; however, as I later discovered,
that some officers, above the rank of Lieutenant Commander, have most
definitely been briefed on them. As a career military officer I was
witnessing war winning technology at work and was pleased we had this sort
of kit in our armory.
But once more, things began to get a bit
strange, and what follows still remains difficult for me to properly
describe:
After the last Cape Wrath exercise (I did many) I was bussed down to Glasgow
for the flight back down south to England. On the way to Glasgow the bus
diverted to a place near the town of Ayr, on the West Scottish coast, about
30 odd miles from Glasgow.
There we were taken to room in an ordinary looking red sandstone tenement
type building. Inside the room we were introduced to a group of uniformed
people. The uniforms were black military looking flight suits with silver
insignia on the collars.
These were silver bars, not unlike US military
rank insignia. However, they were not from the US. They all spoke with
crystal clear English accents. It soon donned on me that we were now in the
company of the pilots of the same craft used in the range exercises due to
the ensuing discussions that took place, which was a kind of post exercise
de-briefing.
The pilots were all relaxed, very friendly and radiated extremely good
health. One of them, a very healthy looking middle aged man, took time with
me to reassure me that all this was quite normal. He must have noticed that
I was nervous and new to all this.
Also, in the same room were other people. These were young males and
females, wearing some sort of uniform, but not the same uniforms as the
pilots. They (I think?) wore blue coveralls, making what were clearly
goodbyes to others (families?) who were present with them. This goodbye
scene was actually quite emotional albeit quite surreal.
The middle aged pilot mentioned they were going
up for spell. He pointed upwards with a finger as he said this. I was then
given what I can only describe as an instant telepathic vision that I knew
must have come from him.
This was a vivid description of the interior of
a circular vehicle with the same people, the ones in the room making their
goodbyes, sat inside the craft and whishing up through the atmosphere to
dock with a massive structure in space still with the earth in full view.
In this structure I briefly saw what I know to be
Greys glancing at us and
then completely ignoring us.
He then said,
This is how we get around and everyone is a
volunteer and no one is forced to do this.
He strongly emphasized this point. I must say
that I felt this person, the middle aged pilot, to be quite benevolent and
understanding.
He knew I was balking at the thought of going
into space and
seeing aliens and he understood this. I had a kind of
quasi-religious feeling from this man; he simply emanated complete
understanding and care. I cant remember how long we stayed there in the
building, but I recall feeling very much at peace afterwards as if it was
indeed all was very normal, but knowing at the same time it most certainly
was not.
I went back to my normal naval duties with very little inclination of what I
had witnessed was in any way fantastic.
However, towards the end of my
military career I became very stressed to the point of having a breakdown. I
thought it was all the conflicts I had been through or my difficult personal
life, but somewhere in my mind was this vision of this massive structure in
space, vividly dreaming I was regularly going back there.
These dreams became very intrusive, but
thankfully stopped some time ago. Together with this and the other knowledge
I had I knew my story was hopelessly and ridiculously unbelievable. How
can anyone talk about such things?
This is what upset me most: knowledge that I
could not possibly talk to anyone about.
Over Government
1999. Now a civilian after a long naval career, reaching middle officer
rank, I took up a senior post within a City of London institution, which I
felt fortunate to get since London was my home town.
I was directed to and
recommended for this job by my last Commanding Officer, a Commodore, who
seemed to have some high connections in the City. I realize now that I was
forwarded for this job because I was, in the know and a, safe pair of
hands someone who could be trusted. (They assumed I was a Mason)
Soon after starting with the City I was invited
to become an associate member with various
City of London Livery Companys.
I felt that I was being elevated into the Citys inner circles, which indeed
Livery Companies are. However, I decided, in my defense, to keep myself to
myself. None the less, I was always invited to dinners whose guest list was
a whose who.
These were mostly well known people from the
world banking community, well known politicians together with and serving
and ex-serving military. This was a real band of brothers and I knew many
of them on a first name basis. It was at these dinners and other social
events that I realized I was being vetted by them.
For my part, I played the role very well and was
soon incorporated as a trusted senior City employee, with middle rank so I
knew my place, as it were, and was accorded their trust.
What I picked up immediately from this band of brothers is their cold
disdain for the ordinary lives people live, as if the general public
mattered little, unless they were employed by them. (Those in their employ
are very obedient and servile)
This band all operated as if they were
governing the country, which indeed they were doing dealing with events with
extraordinary persuasive weight, wielding power through making direct
mostly financial decisions that were repeated exactly, as they determined,
to the so called elected government in Parliament. They always exude a
kind of overwhelming power, so much so, that being in their company, for any
length of time, is really not for the faint hearted.
It soon became apparent that
the government of the UK is directed from the
Citys Financial Institutions, to which I was connected and also the Livery
Company Buildings, the Guildhall, (the Citys HQ) and Mansion House.
(Mansion House is the traditional seat of the Masonic elected Lord Mayor of
London)
The guise for all this is very simple.
The City is historically independent
from anything emanating from the outside. No government body regulates or
audits their activity. They are a law unto themselves, answerable to no one,
save themselves, or the Monarch who is revered by the City with a Goddess
like passion. Anyone, and this became clear, operating at any
significant level of management in the Citys financial and government
structure
is a Mason and every meeting, social or
otherwise, will always be an extension of Livery Company Masonic
dealing.
The more one delves into their activity, and I
have, the more one can see that the City is very much like
the Vatican. That
is a tiny City state with an obscure power wielding political structure,
dating back more than 1500 years with no recognizable change save the
passage of time. I personally believe, unquestionably, that the City of
London extends its power over the other major world financial centers with
anecdotal evidence that the City controls the
US Federal Reserve.
I feel no one should be surprised that all
political and financial power is held firmly within the City of London.
The Timeline
In late 2005 I attended what I thought was a normal 3 monthly City security
& financial planning meeting since the usual crowd were emailed listed for
attendance. The meeting turned out to be something entirely different. To my
surprise (shock) this was very much a Masonic level meeting instead. No
notes taken word of mouth only.
At the meeting mention was made that
the Timeline for
war against Iran was
being delayed to a point where other contingencies had to be put in place.
Contingencies were then mentioned, in quite a
matter of fact fashion.
-
First was the Israeli reluctance to strike and
provoke Iran into armed action and that Israel promised action that action
would soon take place in order to provoke the required Iranian military
response. (Israel soon after attacked Iranian backed Hizbollah bases in the
Lebanon) That was my first surprise.
-
The second was mention of Japanese reluctance to
create havoc within the fledging Chinese financial sectors. China was
growing too quickly with the Chinese military the being main beneficiary.
-
The third surprise was open talk about the use of biological weapons when
they would be used since timing appeared to be crucial.
-
Then there was more talk centered on how Iran
must be engaged militarily in order to provoke the desired military response
from China.
The talk continued about how long conventional weapons should be
used, knowing they would be hopeless against a Chinese military onslaught in
the region. It soon transpired that they were not making decisions.
They were discussing something that had already
been planned and so they were simply sharing that information between
themselves. It also became clear that the central issue of the meeting was
when the balloon would go up. Further issues dealt with finances, the
moving of resources and protection of assets and the central control of
these resources: the bringing in outlying assets.
I recall the chain/sequence of events, which ran
something like this:
-
They needed either the Iranians or the Chinese to be guilty of first use
nuclear weapons in order to justify the next stage. (My information shows
that the Iranians do indeed have a tactical nuclear capability)
-
The next stage would be a measured regional
nuclear response, enough to cause an immediate ceasefire. This ceasefire
would create the time needed to put in place unified totalitarian western
governments.
-
Thereafter, or concurrent,
biological weapons would be used
against the Chinese population. This would then set of another chain of
events that would collapse the whole Chinese political and social
infrastructure.
-
This was mentioned as: Disease, followed by wide spread food
shortages, followed by mass starvation.
-
Somehow, this would then cause the Chinese
military to attack eastern Russia. The biological agents were described as
being flu like and would spread like wild fire.
It shocks and sickens me to
describe these events. It shocks me even more to know that plausible events
are being manipulated to cause the extinction of a whole part of the human
race.
The evidence was clear. There does indeed exist a Timeline for future
conflict that this country, the UK, was using this as some sort of world
government business plan and many millions would die as a result.
The plan is openly described in these circles as
the Anglo Saxon Mission.
For those living in
the UK
Interestingly, the meeting was attended by a former Commissioner for Police
(name withheld).
His role, it became clear, is gaining enough
legislation to empower the private security industry to enable him to be
head of what he himself called:
The Greater Policing Community to control
dissidence within the UK population.
Few people realize, that, at this moment, there
are some 500.000 people working in the UK private security industry.
Fewer
still realize this industry has already been empowered through government
backed public control policing powers, linked to the Public Order Act. This
Parliamentary Act of police empowerment is currently being extended to
include more powers such a direct powers of arrest and detention the same
as those currently being sought for Community Police Officers and Civil
Enforcement Officers.
In time of war Britain will become a totalitarian police state headed by a
military government empowered through the City of London.
I can be certain of this, and to which, people
living in the UK remain, by and large, oblivious.
Just to re-cap
The above can only be considered as simply a background briefing, knowing
that its contents can be checked and easily verified by those with the will
to do so.
However to be clear:
-
Iran will soon be attacked, possibly
within 18 months of writing this.
-
China will come to the aid of Iran to
protect its own interests.
-
Nuclear weapons will be used by either
Iran or China, with Israel provoking their first use.
-
Much of the Middle East will be laid to
waste. Millions will die in a very short period of time.
-
China will forcibly move into parts of
Russia to extend ceasefire lines.
-
Biological weapons will be deployed
against China. China will catch a cold.
There is some sort of malevolent ET alliance at
work, profitably being used by the UK, US and other western powers,
including Japan. Refer to Black Projects.
I also understand that other, more humanitarian
ET entities are working against this Timeline and are, somehow, maintaining
a precarious balance without taking any direct intervention themselves.
I have more to add to this:
-
The western powers are actively seeking
a perfect war and have been engaged in doing so throughout the
20th century up to present times.
-
WWI and WWII were simply stepping stones
both pre-determined and successful.
-
The next Great War is now just round the
corner.
-
This war will significantly reduce the
worlds population, possibly by half, in a very short period of
time.
-
This over government feels this course
of action to be wholly righteous and is pursuing this action with
astonishing determination.
For my part I feel that I have contributed in
some way to all this happening, more so, since I knew about this many years
ago, but failed to see its full significance- a denial on my part no doubt.
There is only so much that a person can take in
not unless one willingly gives over their own spirit to their cause the
greatest of evils.
Stay with me on this
The wider picture remains to me quite unclear. None
the less, I have seen what will become of the physical shape of this world
in a few short years to come.
The over-government knows this too and is using
this Timeline as way of preparation. They know that the survivors from what
is about to happen will determine the physical future of mankind on this
planet for millennia to come. They see this as a race against time before
time itself prevents them.
You see, they are governed by time, while most
everyone else living on this planet is not.
I discovered this phenomena some time ago and
came to understand why those involved with this over government are
desperate not be caught in the present moment. They cant stand still and
must at all costs keep striving towards their own manufactured goals. By
doing so they are corralling everyone else, sheep like, into pens. The fuel
they use to do this is fear.
The wider picture I mentioned, while much of it still remains unclear to me,
is most definitely signaling a massive geo-physical change, a change that is
very much like the seasons albeit a season that only occurs once in every
11,500 years. Those in over government are very much aware of this season
and are driven to survive this change with their bloodline intact and to
remain in overall control, very much as it is now.
One big question, to those awake to this change, is when will happen?
Personally, I have little idea of an exact time
other than it will be soon. I regard precise timings, such as
21st Dec 2012,
with much suspicion.
However, I say soon. Soon, to me, is something that is
highly likely to happen in my own lifetime. I say this since I was here
during the last season of change and see again, quite clearly, a chain of
events that cannot be confused with anything other than this change taking
place again soon.
Before this change happened last time, 11500 years ago, there was much
warning from those who were coming and going between space to earth. These
people were very much part of the human race at the time and not regarded as
Gods. They had always been here and were, by and large, though not always,
quite compassionate in nature.
They lived among us and shared what they could,
being able to do so, since the population then living on earth was far fewer
in number since people then lived to very old age compared to the 3 score
and 10 of today. Then the visible changes were noted as the earth magnetic
poles drifting further and further away from true north and south. This
caused seasonal differences that badly affected agriculture and living
conditions, causing many of the larger settlements to migrate away from both
Polar Regions.
Incidentally, the space traveling people were
known then as the, Alhoo (thats how it sounds)
The Alhoo went to great lengths to ensure that
as many people as possible would survive the change. There was no
discrimination as to who would be saved. Additionally, around this time,
other ET races appeared on earth. Some of these races interfered with the
preparations being made by the Alhoo causing much disruption, which finally
led to open conflict both in space and here on earth.
This was a battle of domination that continued
right up until the earths surface finally changed its position. This is
when the earths crust shifted some 30 degrees towards the south. It is worth
knowing that the Alhoo came back to earth afterwards, but, unfortunately,
only remnants of the civilization they had built was left, scattered along
the coastal regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It should also be
known that the Alhoo were not suited to life on earth and so never became
permanent residents.
They came, stayed a while and then went, very
much like visiting parents.
Now, after the last change, came the other
races, some able to live more comfortably on the planet. The pre-dominant
race was
reptilian and did not resemble any human made after the Alhoo.
It
is the reptilian residency that was to mark the new season that had just
begun in the aftermath of the change. These people were not kind or
compassionate and far less spiritual in nature. They were cold and
demanding, regarding fear and total respect from the human survivors as
values.
I shall come back to this period later.
The Pyramids of Giza
As part of the preparations for the coming change, the Alhoo built what is
now known as the
Giza Complex, just outside Cairo.
This site was built well in advance of the
change and took just 5 years to complete with most of the effort going into
planning rather than construction. These pyramids contained every example of
Alhoo technology, serving principally as a beacon that could be heard far in
space, providing a vast/diverse range of geo-physical information regarding
the real time state of the earth.
This meant that the Alhoo could remain in space
and listen to what was happening on the surface. Other less known sites
were constructed on a belt, crossing the continents at latitudes 60
degrees north and south of the equator. I knew about this then as did most
other people alive at the time. There was an energy that our civilization
would physically survive the coming change.
Much discussion has ranged over what type of
technology was used to construct the Giza complex. It wasnt ropes, tackles
and muscle. It was sound. Everything has a frequency even stone. Stones
were cut and lifted just by tapping into the frequencies contained within.
Nothing more was needed. More than this the pyramids were self illuminating
and shone brightly throughout the night.
All this was possible just by changing the
frequency. I will add, for sake of argument, that the pyramids fell into
disrepair, though misuse, thousands of years before the Pharaohs came into
power. Cheops did not build them; he and others attempted a repair without
knowing fully the original purpose of the complex. I feel this is important
to know.
I am asked what life was like before the change and while the Alhoo were
present together with mankind?
There were 2 main cities situated on the North Antarctic coast. The first
and oldest city was called Charmaran with a population of around 300,000
souls. The second city was called Charmaran Te, whose population was far
more. This newer city resembled a mountain from the distance since it was
building upon building rising high almost into the clouds.
Both cities were separated by a mountain range
and both enjoyed temperate weather conditions throughout the year. There
were very little differences in the seasons, very much like the South Africa
of today. This means of course that
the Antarctic land mass was situated
further to the north in those days. Life was based around subsisting on
agriculture and maritime trading mostly from the east from the lands where
India and China now are.
This was a healthy trade that lasted many
thousands of years with communities on both sides of the world developing
together with very little effort. However, the Charmarans were quite
spiritually evolved. This was mostly due to the patient influence of the
Alhoo.
Therefore, other human communities were very much attracted to them
but were not allowed to cross breed. This was forbidden by the Alhoo, simply because
of the time it would take to develop those other communities to a similar
level enjoyed by the Charmarans.
I am reminded that long life was apparent
throughout the world in those days and having children, though welcome, was
quite a rare occasion. It was not unusual for someone to live healthily for
over a 1000 years.
Try to imagine your physical body continually
renewing itself in a healthy mature condition until such times that the
spirit must move on. 1000 years here on earth is quite enough time for any
soul.
The short life span of this age is a by product of a further cross
fertilization processes conducted by the reptilians. However, physical life
span is not such an important issue.
I can tell you, however, that mankind is able to
live long lives, as before, if simple measures were taken to readjust the
human DNA.
Who are these
reptilians?
11,500 years ago not much was known about
the reptilian looking race other
than they shared knowledge of space through time travel with other races
such as the Alhoo of earth. What became apparent is their low spiritual
development and disdain for anything they feel is weak, even among their own
kind. As I mentioned their lives are determined by time.
They are not aware of a timeless present due to
their low level of conscious awareness. However, this low level of conscious
awareness is superbly masked by their ability to live extremely long lives
and the ease at which they can control anyone who comes into contact with
them.
They live on fear and are energized/empowered through this. The
reptilians became the dominant controlling entity on earth because of their
abilities to sustain themselves here.
The Alhoo, while they have never left, can never
be permanently resident. However, it must be known that the Alhoo do live
through us since we are them and they are us. We are no different from the
Alhoo when all is said and done. The Alhoo are essentially now space
dwellers and are far in advance of the reptilians.
Now, the reptilians know
very well that the Alhoo started civilization here on earth doing so through
the early human forms and that we, the current form of humankind, look and
think very much like them.
They also know that we have a level of conscious
awareness that can be easily affected through fear in order to gain our
compliance. That fear network has been with us and developed by them
throughout this current age. All through this present time the reptilians
have held kingship over mankind, dominating and controlling all aspects of
our physical lives on earth.
This age has been marked by them as one of
continual conflict and forced manipulation shaped by fear. The Alhoo have
been aware of this, but to them, as it is to us, time means nothing at all.
Time is meaningless even in the physical world we think we know so well.
Now, the Alhoo will change this experience once it has seen itself out.
The reptilian experience is about to end and of
course they do not wish it to end and are trying extremely hard to ensure it
doesnt. They cannot and will not, understand that their experience here is
transitory.
They believe it is eternal, since they are
unable, at any level, to comprehend otherwise.
