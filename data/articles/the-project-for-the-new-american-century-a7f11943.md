This film goes in detail through the untold history of
The Project for the
New American Century with tons of archival footage and connects it right
into the present.
This film exposes how every major war in US history was based
on a complete fraud with video of insiders themselves admitting it. This
film shows how the first film theaters in the US were used over a hundred
years ago to broadcast propaganda to rile the American people into the
Spanish-American War.
This film shows the white papers of the oil company Unocal
which called for the creation of a pipeline through Afghanistan and how
their exact needs were fulfilled through the US invasion of Afghanistan.
This film shows how Halliburton under their "cost plus"
exclusive contract with the US Government went on a mad dash spending spree
akin to something out of the movie Brewster's Millions, yet instead of
blowing $30 million they blew through BILLIONS by literally burning millions
of dollars worth of hundred thousand dollar cars and trucks if they had so
much as a flat tire.
"A stunning film. It should be seen as widely as
possible, in cinemas, bars, clubs, at meetings and, of course, through
the internet.
I'm sure the film will continue to be a source of debate
and political education for many years. Maybe until the war criminals
have been brought to trial."
Ken Loach
While Massimo Mazzucco's first political documentary,
GLOBAL DECEIT
(2006), focused on the long list of
inconsistencies in the official version of the 9/11 attacks,
THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY
explores the historical, philosophical and
economic background that suggests a matrix for such events that is much
closer to home than the so-called "Islamic terrorism".
The film provides solid evidence for the true reasons behind
the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, whose unfolding is described in chilling
detail in a document called "Project for the New American Century",
published in the year 2,000, that seems to have served as the actual
blueprint for such dramatic events
This film is astonishing, it goes in detail through the untold history of
The Project for the New American Century
(below insert), with tons of archival footage and
connects it right into the present.
