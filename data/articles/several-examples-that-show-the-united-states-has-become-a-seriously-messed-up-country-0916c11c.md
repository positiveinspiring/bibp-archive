Messed-Up Country

1 - The
American flag is starting to be banned in schools all over the nation,
and federal courts are
backing them up on this
Last week in Dariano
v. Morgan Hill Unified School Dist., the 9th Circuit ruled
that a public school can actually
ban the American flag.
Making matters worse, the decision
allows the school to ban the American flag and still allow students
to display flags of other countries.
2 -
Speaking of our courts, many of them appear to have literally gone
insane
Just check out what the highest court in
Massachusetts
recently ruled
Massachusetts' highest court has ruled
that a man accused of secretly snapping photos up a woman's skirt on
an MBTA train did not break the law.
The State Supreme Judicial Court on
Wednesday dismissed charges against Michael Robertson of Andover,
who was arrested in August 2010 by transit police.
Officers had set up a sting on the Green
Line after getting reports that Robertson was using his cellphone to
take photos and video up female rider's skirts and dresses.
3 - Parents
are starting to lose the natural affection that they should have for
their children
For example, a pregnant mother that already
had three children recently tried to kill them all by driving her
minivan
into the ocean
"The two in the back seat was crying,
with their arms out saying 'Our mommy's trying to kill us, please
help'," said Tesseneer.
A bystander's video of the rescue shows
a rescuer carrying two children away from the sinking van when the
children tell them there was another child inside.
"The kids are like, 'No there's a baby.
There's a baby'," Tesseneer said. "She (the mother) wouldn't say a
word. She didn't tell us nothing about a baby."
The men are seen on video frantically
trying to get to the small child through the hatchback and the
driver's side door.
4 - In the
old days, some people would cruelly abandon their pets in the woods, but
now this is actually happening
to children
A Florida couple was arrested for
allegedly abandoning their three young children in the woods,
authorities said.
Michael and Sarah Butcher, both 30,
were first arrested Friday after illegally parking their red
truck in a private RV park in Punta Gorda.
Cops later found crystal meth in their
car's glove compartment, along with a syringe and a burnt spoon,
according to the arrest report.
After the pair was taken to jail -
where they repeatedly claimed to be brother and sister - the police
received a call that three children were found walking in the woods,
"very dirty, hungry, and cold," according to a police report.
5 -
Teenagers in America just continue to become
even more cruel
Perhaps we should rethink the way that we
are raising our children
Four teenagers are accused of carving a
swastika into the forehead of a 16-year-old boy.
The Oregonian reports that
Jenna Montgomery, 15, Jess Taylor, 17, Blue Kalmbach, 15, and a
14-year-old boy attacked the boy in a shed, shooting him with a BB
gun and hitting him with a crow bar, on top of
carving a swastika into his
forehead.
6 - The FDA
is actually considering making it legal for doctors and scientists to
create "three
parent babies" in the United States
7 - Our
financial system appears to be more corrupt than it ever has been before
And yet nobody ever seems
to go to prison
In a nearly $13 billion settlement with
the U.S. Justice Department in November 2013, JPMorganChase
admitted that it, along with every other large U.S. bank, had
engaged in mortgage fraud as a routine business practice, sowing the
seeds of the mortgage meltdown.
JPMorgan and other megabanks have now
been caught in over a dozen major frauds, including LIBOR-rigging
and bid-rigging; yet no prominent banker has gone to jail.
8 - Sexual
perversion of all types is running rampant in America.
Just consider what one Florida man recently
did
with a dog
Police have arrested a Tampa man after
his neighbors reported that he was having sex with a dog.
According to Tampa Police, officers were
flagged down by the man's neighbors on N. Marks Street Tuesday
afternoon.
"When officers arrived on scene,
they were greeted by a small crowd of residents who were
disturbed by their neighbor's activity with the dog," a police
spokeswoman explained.
"Several of the witnesses stated
that they yelled at the suspect to stop, but he ignored their
commands."
9 - An
all-time high
59 percent of all Americans believe that the traditional definition
of marriage needs to be changed
10 - The
popularity of "throuples" has surged so much that a new dating website
has been launched
that will cater to them specifically
11 -
Authorities around the nation are alarmed at the rise in occult-inspired
crimes that appears to be happening
Most of you have probably heard about "the
Craigslist Killer" by now
A woman in Pennsylvania who has been
charged with murder for killing a man she met on Craigslist has
told reporters that she has committed over 20 murders as part of a
satanic cult.
"When I hit 22 [murders], I stopped
counting," 19-year-old Miranda Barbour told the Daily Item
on Saturday.
12 - The
United States already has the highest rate of divorce in the entire
world, and now the divorce rate is on the rise again
Some pundits are blaming the "improving
economy" for this.
13 - In
America today, there are
60 million people that abuse alcohol and there are 22 million people
that use illegal drugs.
14 - As I
wrote about
recently, there are
747,408 registered sex offenders in the U.S. according to the
National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
That number only includes the ones that have
been caught and convicted.
15 -
Planned Parenthood has produced a video "that
promotes bondage and sadomasochism" to teens
Planned Parenthood of Northern New
England (PPNNE) - which received more than $2.75 million in
government funding in 2012 - has produced and posted online a video
specifically aimed at teenagers that promotes bondage and
sadomasochism (BDSM) and proposes "rules" to follow when engaging in
these activities.
"People sometimes think that those who
practice BDSM are emotionally scarred or were once abused - not
true, it's a total myth," the host of the video, Laci Green, informs
its intended audience of teens.
"BDSM relies upon and creates trust,"
she says.
By the way, the U.S. government gives
hundreds of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood each year.
16 -
Speaking of Planned Parenthood,
more than 56 million American babies have been slaughtered in this
country since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973
