According to a group of researchers, their
mathematical model using food prices can predict social unrest and riots.
Given the drought and rampant speculation, this
may bode ill for several regions in the world.
Food prices have been rising for quite some time, and arent showing any
sign of slowing.
People raise their voices and go to arms for
reasons too complicated to address here altogether, but it would be folly to
leave hunger out of the equation.
The spark may be an anti-Islam film or an
incident of police brutality, but Yaneer Bar-Yam of the New England Complex
Systems Institute (NECSI) in Cambridge, Massachusetts says that its high food
prices that create,
the range of conditions in which the
tiniest spark can lead to riots.
History of Accurate
Predictions
The NECSI has received attention of late for its
accurate predictions of food price behavior, most notably those showing
spikes in food prices that coincided with the 2007-2008 riots.
They even submitted findings to the U.S.
government - four days before Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian produce
vendor, set himself on fire and, many say, catalyzed
the Arab Spring.
The institute has also drawn fire for not being
peer-reviewed.
One such critic, economist Dave Lobell,
nevertheless
concedes that at least the public sees the institutes predictions well
before the completion of a theoretical peer review process, and time will
tell if the predictions are accurate.
Ready to Riot
The NECSI models show that the stage is set for
rioting when the food price index surpasses 210.

Unfortunately, the index has been sneaking
around that number since July, thanks especially to the summer drought.
Wheat is $9 a bushel - a problem especially for the Middle East which
imports most of that staple.
Also, thanks to ethanol production, corn is
$7.56 a bushel.
Peter TImmer, a Harvard professor
emeritus recently inducted into NECSI faculty, says that the model is,
better than anything my economics
colleagues have done to explain food prices. The model really works.
Time will tell, though it seems history is on
the institutes side.
