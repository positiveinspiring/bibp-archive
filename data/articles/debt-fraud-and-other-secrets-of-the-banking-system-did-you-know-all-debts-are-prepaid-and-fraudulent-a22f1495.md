Shortly after the Federal Reserve (FED) was established in the USA in 1913, the international Banksters changed the process of how banks lend money to the American people and the rest of the world.
They did this by removing the gold backed US dollar and replaced it with fiat currency that is backed by the good faith and credit of the American people.
This criminal act made every American a slave to the Banksters and has slowly destroyed the Western economy.
Today, banks don't actually lend out 'real money,' but instead lend out notes or checks that are backed by a promise to pay.
Before lending out these notes or checks, the borrower has to sign documents that have terms and conditions written on them along with a price tag (the amount of money the borrower agrees to pay back). A more specific name for these documents is "negotiable contracts."
These negotiable contracts or negotiable instruments are basically IOUs with a natural person's signature on them.
Due to the corruption in the financial system, banks can legally create money out of thin air. However, they can't lawfully create money. Unfortunately, the people have become too scared and ignorant to challenge the criminal banking system, and therefore the Banksters who control the banking system think they can do whatever they want.
Before I expose more secrets of the banking system, let us turn our attention to the two words lawful and legal. When it comes to the Western justice system, knowing the difference between these two words can either free you or enslave you.

It is crucial to define the difference between legal and lawful. The generic Constitution references genuine law. The present civil authorities and their courts use the word legal. Is there a difference in the meanings? The following is quoted from A Dictionary of Law 1893: Lawful. In accordance with the law of the land; according to the law; permitted, sanctioned, or justified by law. "Lawful" properly implies a thing conformable to or enjoined by law; "Legal", a thing in the form or after the manner of law or binding by law. A writ or warrant issuing from any court, under color of law, is a "legal" process however defective. See legal. [Bold emphasis added] Legal. Latin legalis. Pertaining to the understanding, the exposition, the administration, the science and the practice of law: as, the legal profession, legal advice; legal blanks, newspaper. Implied or imputed in law. Opposed to actual "Legal" looks more to the letter [form/appearance], and "Lawful" to the spirit [substance/content], of the law. "Legal" is more appropriate for conformity to positive rules of law; "Lawful" for accord with ethical principle. "Legal" imports rather that the forms [appearances] of law are observed, that the proceeding is correct in method, that rules prescribed have been obeyed; "Lawful" that the right is actful in substance, that moral quality is secured. "Legal" is the antithesis of equitable, and the equivalent of constructive. 2 Abbott's Law Dic. 24

Here is another excerpt from a different website (SpoonFedTruth.ucoz.com) about the difference between lawful and legal.
In order to understand the difference in what is legal, and what is lawful we must understand how assumption, and presumption plays a major role in the fraud called "The Legal System". As an example lets take a really basic event like marriage. As we all know marriage is a "lawful" institution. People have been getting married for centuries. In fact in ancient times all it took for two people to marry was to stand in their village before their piers, and THEIR god (nothing about religion), and announce their intentions, and their vows to each other. Now they are married, and recognized as such under the natural law "Common Law". Let us now look at the process today. You decide to marry your soul mate. The first thing you must do (planning aside) is apply for a marriage license, which seems pretty straight forward right? Wrong! The need for a license is a presumption, or assumption on your part! This assumption results from the constant feeding of misinformation that you have been subject to throughout your life, and the way that the religious, government administered education systems have indoctrinated you during your growing years.

In simple terms, something that is lawful is above something that is legal.
If something is legal, it doesn't necessary mean that it is lawful. For example, killing someone is unlawful but can be legal:
Lawful is more about natural rights (God given rights) Legal is more about rights given by man or the government
Lawful is more about natural rights (God given rights)
Legal is more about rights given by man or the government
When it comes to spiritual freedom, Natural Law is the most important knowledge you need to know. One of the most basic natural laws has to do with injury.
This natural law simply states that as long as you don't harm others or their properties, you are free to do whatever you want.
Once you know Natural Law and how to defend your natural rights, judges and attorneys will be scared to even look you in the eyes, because they know that you might know you are above their jurisdiction and statutory rules.
For more information about Natural Law and how to defend your natural rights, read my empowering article titled Why You Need to Study Natural Law.
Another important fact you should be aware of is the difference between a lawful term and a legal term. Since I already explained the difference between lawful and legal, I'll just give you an example of something that is a lawful term and something that is considered a legal term.
For example, traveling is a lawful term and driving is a legal term. Traveling is a natural right and therefore you can't be arrested for traveling. On the other hand, driving is a privilege. If a cop pulls you over and you consent to be driving, the cop can legally arrest you for breaking traffic statutes.
When we apply for a license (e.g., marriage license, driver's license), what we are actually doing is asking the government permission to do something that is legal.
However, we already have the natural right to marry or travel, so we don't need permission from the government. In other words, we aren't lawfully required to get any kind of license.
A license is basically a permission contract. Guess who often ask for permission before they do something? Children!
Due to our irresponsible action of always asking permission to do something legal, the government views us as children and therefore the government thinks that it has the legal right to control us.
One of the main reasons why the government has become corrupt and tyrannical is because we just don't want to freaking grow up.
Since you now have a general idea of the difference between lawful and legal, let us turn our attention back to the secrets of how banks create "money."
When you go to apply for a loan at a bank, if approved, the bank gives you a piece of paper written with specific legal words on it to sign. Once you sign this piece of paper, it becomes a negotiable instrument with value.
The only reason why this piece of paper has value is because you have agreed to pay back the bank with real money. To keep it simple, this piece of paper, which is known as a loan contract, has now become a debt.
Guess who is the collateral for that debt? You the borrower!
After you sign the loan contract, the bank places a lien against the contract and then sells it as a security on the stock exchange after three days. The bank does this because it knows that it is committing fraud.
By selling it to other investors, the bank can relieve itself from obligation while at the same time make some profit. The bank also purchases an insurance policy for the loan contract, so that if you default on the loan, the bank can collect even more profit from the insurance company.
Furthermore, if you used the loan to purchase a car, a house, or something with great value and can't pay your monthly payment, the bank will eventually take you to court and try to take that property from you, so that it can sell the property for more profit.
What a bunch of crooks!
This process of how banks create and lend "money" is all based on trickery and deception. Banks don't actually lend money because they create money out of thin air. Since they create money out of thin air and are committing fraud, these actions nullify their loan contracts and thus there is no debt!
Do you realize now why banks are criminal organizations?
Through our birth certificate, which is a bond that is traded as a security in the stock market, all of our current debt and future debt are pretty much prepaid.
When the government securitizes our birth certificate, it also converts it into a public trust.
As described at DailyPaul.com.
So the 'state' or 'government' sends you back a copy of the Trust (birth certificate) that was created for you, by "THEM" and your mother; you go about your merry way using that birth certificate as a means of identity to obtain other adhesion contracts like your drivers license and ss card etc. So the 'state' makes the presumption YOU are operating as a government employee; performing acts of government, etc. It's your brand new-shiny Government Name Badge; makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, doesn't it? The only problem with this little con is: They are treating you like a government employee by forcing their rules/regulations/statutes/taxes down your throat, but somehow seem to be forgetting one thing..., you're not getting your government check! Did you ever dictate to them the hourly rate for your services? (Rod Class also explains this if you listen to his archived shows below). Why aren't YOU getting paid? Why aren't they taking care of all vehicle maintenance? Why are they charging you with an income tax? Why do they laugh at your "I'm a free man on the land arguments?" Because YOU haven't rebutted the presumption that YOU are a government employee; operating in that capacity. You must rebut the presumption you're operating as a government official; performing any act of government; and that you're being paid to so. EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE USING "THEIR" MEMBERSHIP CARDS, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO OPERATE IN THAT CAPACITY AS AN EMPLOYEE! No one can force you to work for free; not even your own government. So if they insist you're a government employee because you haven't rebutted THEIR claim, why aren't they paying you your government check?

Once you know the process of how banks create money out of thin air and how your birth certificate is used as collateral for your debt and the national debt of your country, you should know that all debts are prepaid and fraudulent.
Two decades after the Federal Reserve was established (1913), the USA became "bankrupt."
This bankruptcy was engineered by the Banksters to enslave the American people with debt and destroy their freedom and sovereignty.
The Banksters also did this to many other countries throughout the world.
On March 9, 1933, House Joint Resolution No. 192-10 by the 73rd Congress, was voted into law, which is the Emergency Banking Act. This Act declared the Treasury of the United States 'Bankrupt', which is an impossible feat since the U.S. Treasury was secretly closed by the Congress twelve years earlier in 1921. The Emergency Banking Act succeeded in abrogating America's gold standard and hypothecated all property found within the United States to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank. All Sovereign American Citizens residing within the Republic of States suddenly and falsely were expatriated from their Sovereign American status without their knowledge or consent and their labor, souls, children, property, sweat equity and credit became the financial collateral for the public debt, which had then been converted into a Public Trust, which had been scripted after the ancient Roman Trusts. "Script" money or negotiable debt instruments was issued by a private corporation, which is owned by a group of Sabbatean European Jewish Bankers and which is known to everybody as "The Federal Reserve System." These promissory notes were called Federal Reserve Notes and our future treatment by the U.S. Government was to be redefined under USC [United States Code] Title 50, 'The Trading with the Enemy Act' in which American citizens are defined as, "an enemy of their government" and this is the reason why Lincoln's Declaration of War is renewed yearly by Congress and the President! In the same year President Roosevelt closed THE VIRGINIA COLONY CORPORATION and opened a new Government Corporation called THE UNITED STATES, INC.

So there you go folks! A little history of the USA that they never taught us in high school.
The UNITED STATES is a CORPORATION owned and controlled by the CROWN OF ENGLAND, which is controlled by the VATICAN. The Crown of England and the Vatican are corporations controlled by secret societies!
If you want proof that secret societies control the USA and its financial system, look at the Great Seal on the one dollar bill below:
Here is a closer view of the Great Seal on the one dollar bill:
If you look at the top of the Great Seal, you will see the phrase Annuit Coeptis.
The word Annuit is translated as "our enterprise" and the word Coeptis is translated as "crowned with success." Together the two words means "our enterprise is now a success."
To find out what enterprise they are talking about, look at the bottom of the Great Seal and you should see the phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum, which translates as the "new order of the world" or the "new world order."
At the top of the pyramid, there is an illuminated triangle with an eye inside of it. This illuminated triangle is a masonic symbol, which is often referred to as the "all seeing eye." Besides looking at the all seeing eye symbol, try counting the number of stairs on the pyramid and you should get 13 stairs.
Also notice that the phrase Annuit Coeptis has 13 letters. The number 13 is a very important number in the religion of secret societies. Have you ever wondered why the USA used to have 13 colonies?
At the bottom of the pyramid, there is the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI. When decoded, they add up to 1776. Most historians agree that the year 1776 was the year the USA officially declared its independence from Great Britain.
What many of them don't know is that 1776 was also the year that the Bavarian Illuminati was founded.
If you look at the right side of the back of the one dollar bill, you should see another symbol, which has an eagle in it. Some researchers of secret societies believe it is actually a phoenix.
This symbol also has the number 13 encoded in it. If you look closely at the symbol, you should see the eagle holding a branch with 13 leaves. There are also 13 berries on the leaves. On the other leg, the eagle is holding 13 arrows.
Plus, there are 13 stars above the eagle's head and 13 stripes on the shield.
Did you notice that the 13 stars above the eagle's head is shaped like a 6-pointed star, also known as the Hexagram or the Star of David?
The Hexagram is a Masonic symbol that the Zionists start using in the late 1800s to represent their secret society. This symbol doesn't really have much to do with the common Jewish people.
Why are secret societies so obsessed with masonic symbols, numerology, and secret codes you may ask? Secret societies are similar to street gangs, except that they are much more organize and a lot more powerful than street gangs.
Like street gangs, secret societies like to mark their territories with signs and symbols to let other secret societies know that they own a property or a territory. By marking the one dollar bill with the all seeing eye, the Illuminati is telling you that they control the financial system of the USA.
Secret societies also use symbols that contain sacred geometries and sacred seals to produce dark magic effects. These dark magic effects can affect our mind to a certain point. It is important to know that sacred geometries aren't evil things, because they can be used for good or evil purposes.
Sacred geometries are some of the building blocks of the Universe.
Without them reality and life can't exist.
Rick Ross - CNN Proof Freemason - The Illuminati Control the World
The NWO is a secret organization made up of a few secret societies, including but not limited to,
the Illuminati the Jesuits the Freemasons the Zionists the Nazis the Vatican the Skull and Bones
the Illuminati
the Jesuits
the Freemasons
the Zionists
the Nazis
the Vatican
the Skull and Bones
These secret societies are very obsessed with numerology, sacred geometry, sacred science, and dark magic.
Why? Because if you understand how numerology, sacred geometry, sacred science, and magic work, you can affect how energy manifests itself into material things. This allows you to control how nature creates reality to a certain point.
Thus, "he who has the knowledge has the power" to control the world!
Two of the main goals of the NWO are to establish,
a one world religion a one world government,
a one world religion
a one world government,
...to control and enslave humanity.
Unfortunately for the NWO, too many people are waking up to its diabolical plans.
The NWO's empire is collapsing because the cycle of the dark ages is coming to an end. We are in the process of moving to the new age of Aquarius and this age will help wake up many people to the fact that they have been enslaved.
As long as this great awakening continues, humanity will have a bright future.
After certain politicians allowed The Trading with the Enemy Act to become a law, it made every American citizen an enemy of the UNITED STATES federal government.
Do you now realize why our votes don't really mean anything and why most politicians never live up to their promises?
If you don't live in the USA but live in a Western country, your government most likely consider you as its enemy too. Many Eastern governments also follow this kind of tyrannical system of government.
The good news is that most people working for the government are good people. The problem is that many of them don't understand what is truly going on behind the scene of their political system.
Since most governments throughout the world have become tyrannical and don't care about our natural rights, we shouldn't rely on them and wait for them to save us. Instead, we need to be more responsible people by stop acting like children and start taking actions to create real positive change.
Real change will always come from the people, not the government. The government actually has no power over us when we know how to defend our natural rights.
To learn why we have the real power, read the enlightening article Real Power Comes from the Energy of the People - Why Comprehending this Truth is Essential for Freedom.
