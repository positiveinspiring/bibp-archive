# 9/11 and Operation Gladio

RT: My name's Daniel Bushell. Top
officials say the White House is behind the terrorism of their
population, and new evidence from 9/11. Coming up.
Announcer.
Whistleblowers leak US talks with the head of Al-Qaeda.
World Trade 7 is shown on Times Square.
And the father of a Twin Towers victim tells us about being attacked by
mainstream media.
RT: Decades of Terror against their own population, blamed on
extremists, has actually been funded and planned by the White House,
top-level officials in the government and the CIA confirmed. The
campaign known as Gladio is called by former CIA head Bill Colby a
major operation.
In sworn testimony one of the conspirators confessed: You have to
attack civilians, the people, women, children far removed from any
political game, so authorities can bring in a state of emergency.
Dr. Daniele Ganser, author of NATO's Secret Armies, thanks very much
indeed for coming on. So mainstream media don't report this but it is
now on the record and officially documented that decades of terror
attacks against their own population are in fact organized by the CIA
and the White House.
Dr. Daniele Ganser, author NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Northwoods
with evidence of Operation Gladio, we have the data now available. And
then the people understand that this exists, but they still have a
psychological moment when they have a hard time to believe that it still
goes on, because its bad news. It basically means that terrorism can be
manipulated in order to move people around like sheep really.
And if
youre told youre sheep, youve been moved by false flag terrorism,
this is really something you dont want to hear.
RT: We keep finding this term 'strategy of tension' by the White House.
What does it mean?
Ganser: Strategy of tension actually means that you blow up a bomb and
say your enemy did it. What we do have is evidence that this strategy of
tension goes on it's not over.

Bigger than Watergate, the FBI's Dennis Saccher called US
Shielding of Al-Qaeda leaders up to 2001, and Veterans Today reports it
is still ongoing.
FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds has exposed the innumerable regular
meetings between US representatives, and bin Laden's deputy, now head
of Al-Qaeda Ayman Al-Zawahiri, leading up to September 2001.
July 2001: FBI agents closing in on the 9/11 plotters were thrown off
the case and threatened with prosecution.
Then, when officers arrested Mohammed Khalifa, directly linked to
America's most wanted terrorist Ramzi Yousef, the Secretary of State
himself intervened, had Khalifa immediately deported to Saudi and
released.
Dr. Kevin Barrett is the author of Questioning the War on Terror, great
to speak to you. We actually have leaders admitting, these terrorists
are just tools.
Dr. Kevin Barrett, author of Questioning the War on Terror:
And thats
what Al-Qaeda is. It's a cats paw for Western intelligence agencies.
And we heard this from the Arab worlds leading political commentator
Mohamed Heikal, who told us immediately after 9/11 that this official
story of 9/11 is ridiculous.
He said when he was at the highest levels
of government in Europe he was the one who was in charge of essentially
infiltrating and virtually running so-called Al-Qaeda. He said Al-Qaeda
is full of people from Saudi intelligence, from US intelligence, Israeli
intelligence and of course Egyptian intelligence and it couldnt do
anything on its own.
British scholar Nafeez Ahmed, who's one of the world's leading scholars
of terrorism, talks about an incident that happened in Turkey - I
believe it was a little bit before 9/11.
A supposed senior Al-Qaeda
commander was arrested in Turkey, and the guards of the prison who were
Muslims noticed that he wasnt praying, he was asking for pork and they
said
I thought you were a radical Muslim and he kind of laughed and
said, No, this is all just a strategy of tension.
RT:
This 9/11, the world's top physicists, pilots, engineers join
victims' families to sidestep the mainstream media wall of silence.
Huge billboards on Times Square and across the states confront the fact
most Americans don't know a third giant tower on 9/11 wasn't even hit by
a plane, yet somehow collapsed in free fall.
At 5:20pm, World Trade 7 suddenly, neatly and symmetrically just folded
like a pancake. Visit
ReThink911.
Roland Angle P.E., civil-structural engineer:
This is high-school
physics.
Jonathan Smolens P.E., structural engineer:
A building cannot do a free
fall with 40,000 tons of structural steel, and its structural system,
without it being blown up.
RT:
The government version is that office fires made all 84 steel
columns break at the same time, but there are other versions.
Jon Cole's among thousands of leading independent experts with
Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, great to speak to you. So who
did it?
Jon Cole, Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth:
Who didnt do it is
the 19 hijackers who allegedly flew the planes. It is impossible to melt
that steel by the office fires, the jet fuel, or the collapse itself.
It's a physical impossibility; it cannot be replicated experimentally.
It defies the laws of physics.
If you set aside your politics, if you set aside your beliefs and
religion and you use the scientific method, World Trade Center 7 is
basically a classic controlled demolition when a building free falls and
comes straight down into its own footprint.
Its the only explanation that explains all the evidence:
-
the nano-thermite
-
the iron microspheres
-
the high temperatures found out
there
-
the free fall
-
the uniform acceleration of the towers, when those
came down there was no impact or jolt when it hit the undamaged section
below
Because there was no jolt, something blew those towers out
allowing them to uniformly accelerate downward.
The only thing that makes any sense at all, from a scientific
perspective, is those towers were blown up.
RT:
Jon made a mockery of mainstream sites NatGeo and PopMechanics,
who've desperately tried for instance to show 175 pounds of military
nano-thermite couldn't break the columns. Jon did it, with just one
pound.
Renowned librarian and researcher Elizabeth Woodworth has come in to
help form the Consensus 911 panel, confirming it uses best practice
with the most rigorous peer review. Thanks so much for joining us,
there's this remarkably high consensus among experts that the government
version can't be right.
Elizabeth Woodworth, Consensus 911:
We have some of the top experts in
the field who've published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and
yes, these scientific journals exist, like the Heritage Study, but
they're never covered in the media.
If people knew about the research, they would find it compelling. Dr.
Griffin has said he's never heard of anybody who saw the evidence,
became converted to this point of view and then changed back.
RT:
The panel has made the government already change its story, and
admit Skyscraper 7's free fall.
Woodworth:
Thats right, David Chandler is an extraordinary model maker,
Chandler is on the panel and he devised a model to prove the top floors
fell with no resistance.
There's only one way that that can happen and
that is that all 84 columns were severed at the same moment.
RT:
Dr. Graeme McQueen accessed the New York Fire Department records
from that day, thanks very much for joining us. Never broadcast by
mainstream media, but more than 100 witnesses have even reported the
explosives bringing down the Twin Towers.
Dr. Graeme McQueen, Eyewitness Research:
Here was these roughly 10,000
pages of extremely rich eyewitness material and I found that there were
118 people who clearly perceived explosions.
You know, we have firefighters who are used to fighting high-rise fires,
who are used to encountering smoke explosions and boilers, and yet they
use the words like bombs.
They dont identify with the things we would
expect.
RT:
Bob McIlvane has wanted answers why the post-mortem of his son Bobby
found his fatal injuries in the North Tower consistent not with
fireballs, but explosives.
Yet mainstream host Rachel Maddow here recently sneered he's not only a
conspiracy theorist for asking questions, but also attempted to connect
him to violence and Al-Qaeda.
Rachel Maddow, The Rachel Maddow Show:
All of these nefarious
conspiracies about government plots, to kill, and conspire, and cover up
the real truth, I mean this stuff is as ridiculous as it has ever been
but it is as ridiculous as it is dangerous.
RT:
Bobby's father joins us... How do you feel first losing your son, now
being portrayed as the bad guy?
Bob McIlvane, son died on 9/11:
My son died, he died from an explosion.
I can prove that beyond reasonable doubt. If I was in a courtroom a jury
cannot not accept that as proof.
So thats where we have our problem - when I say,
Well, this is an inside job, my son died from an inside
job, from someone putting bombs detonations.
I would make her sit in this room and go through what I just went with
you, and then I would say,
You as****e now you tell me Im a conspiracy
theorist.
It just shows you how awful our media is. I dont want to call her a
w***e but she's a media w***e. She makes over a million dollars and they
tell her what to say.
One newspaper reporter from the Philadelphia area was very upfront with
me.
She said,
You know Bob, as a reporter I am the problem because we
will lose our jobs. If I take that, just that little bit you just said,
to the editor, he will crush it. So Im telling you right now I cant
put your story out there.
The media owners would not allow it.
The press would not cover it, just that, because it will put a little
doubt in people's minds.
RT:
Who do you blame for all this?
McIlvane:
The people of the Unites States are just as much to blame
because they just want to believe that we are good people, we are an
exceptional country, but this is what governments do, it's very
Machiavellian. Now we have an endless War on Terror.
I know what these people in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan are going
though, because theyre all losing children. And thats what it's all
about - everybody's losing family members. It's pure hell.
So that's it Daniel.

Tomorrow Congress votes
to bomb Syria, the latest war of the
post-9/11 era.
The US would now officially be Al-Qaeda's air force, notes former
congressman Kucinich.
But America's had enough. Nine in ten oppose this invasion, the most
unpopular in history.
Regarding 9/11, a massive 84 percent now say the government's lying.
We now have the precedents documented that the governments prepared to
commit supreme crimes against its population.
Exactly what happened on 9/11 can be argued by both so-called
conspiracy theorists and the authorities. Whats beyond dispute is on
the 11th of September, the world will join to mourn the almost 3,000
innocent people who lost their lives.
This is The Truthseeker.
