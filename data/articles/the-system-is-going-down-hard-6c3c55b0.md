I asked
Gerald Celente how bad things are going to get because he has a feeling for
that more than most. In the interview its a man from Brooklyn talking to
the street wise guy from the Bronx.
The interview leads off an essay that
addresses the converging simultaneous events of,
In Japan today the news is dire on every front.
It is important to note that
only 15% of Japans land is suitable for cultivation, meaning they have to
import
about 50% of their requirements for grain and fodder crops and rely
on imports for most of their supply of meat.
Japan is the worlds 2nd
largest fishing nation having over 2,000 fishing ports and one of the most
advanced aquaculture (sea farming) industries on the planet.
"For Japan, a nation that lives by the sea, food comes in by the sea, energy
comes in by the sea and exports go out by the sea. Everything stops if a
quarter of the coastline has been wiped out," said Weinberg who teaches at
New York University.
The main destruction that has been wrought upon Japan
was centered on that 15% of their cultivatable land and has destroyed a
great part of their ability to feed themselves along with annihilating their
fishing fleet and ports.
Until now, in the first world at least weve pretty much taken food for
granted but thats about to change as the seriousness of the food crisis
bites down harder each month.
Fears grow over global food supply
Riots
spread as global food shortage worsens
We are sleepwalking into a
crisis,
This is a crisis that is going to slice through humanity though
interestingly enough it is coming ashore with other simultaneous crises that
are bringing an abrupt change to modern day life. In Japan it is
unimaginable how life has changed adding one more pressure on the worlds
food supply as well as its financial system.
The United
Nations in March expressed
alarm at a huge decline in bee colonies under a
multiple onslaught of pests and pollution, urging an international effort to
save the pollinators that are vital for food crops. Much of the decline,
ranging up to 85 percent in some areas, is taking place in the
industrialized northern hemisphere due to more than a dozen factors,
according to a report by the UNs environmental agency.
They include
pesticides, air pollution, a lethal pinhead-sized parasite that only affects
bee species in the northern hemisphere, mismanagement of the countryside,
the loss of flowering plants and a decline in beekeepers in Europe.
The bees
are going, bats too.
Fish are dying off in staggering numbers and the birds
are dropping from the sky. Are we next?
The New York Times
reports,
These forecasts of apocalypse have touched a
nerve. Americans, still reeling from the devastating impact of the mortgage
debacle, are fearful that the next economic disaster is only a matter of
time.
To anyone reading the headlines of budget deficits and staggering
pension liabilities, it takes little imagination to conclude that the next
big one will be government itself.
In this report the Times is writing
specifically about a collapse in local government and the services they
provide.
The consequences of western financial indulgences will have a devastating
impact. The adjustment that we are just beginning to undergo will be of such
colossal magnitude that life will be very different for coming generations
compared to our current financial and moral decadence. But this dire
prophecy is not going to play out through a long period of time but will
crash down heavily on everyone during the next two years.
The trend is down with us coming closer and closer to the edge of a
frightening fall that could come as early as next week or next year, its
hard to tell as Gerald Celente shares in the above interview. In agriculture the
world is consuming grains faster than farmers are growing them, draining
reserves and pushing prices up to record levels.
Russias ban on grain
exports means the countrys farmers will plant the fewest wheat fields in
four years, another sign that global prices will keep rising.
Wheat
plantings in Russia, once the second-biggest exporter,
will drop 2.3 percent
to 64.2 million acres for this years crop.
London Store Shelves - November 2010
Supermarkets typically only have an average of 72
hours of inventory so even a temporary shortage of
food supplies could be catastrophic for the unprepared.
In a true emergency most of us will have to fend for ourselves. In a true
emergency forget about finding what you need at the store.
You know what
its like when theres even a moderate snowstorm in the forecast - no bottled
water, no toilet paper, no bread to be found anywhere. The shelves are
stripped bare in hours. The Japanese have reported several supermarkets
running out of food in Tokyo as locals rushed to get essential items.
Most
people simply dont realize
how fragile the food distribution system is in
this or any country and
how vulnerable we are to the climate as well as
insane monetary policy.
China is gobbling up nearly a quarter of the
U.S. soybean crop in order to fatten hogs
and chickens craved by its middle class.
There are seven billion mouths to feed on earth with more arriving every
day.
Growing demand, falling production, a market based upon speculation,
using food to produce fuel, dramatic climate conditions and the huge
reduction of the number of farmers in the first world are all leading to
crisis in and the result is seen in food prices increasing for eighth
consecutive months.
Global food prices reached new highs in February, a U.N.
food agency said last week, warning that oil price spikes could provoke
further increases.
The
Ogallala Aquifer, the worlds largest underground
body of fresh water, has irrigated thousands of square
miles of American farmland. Now it is running dry. In a
brief half-century we have drawn the Ogallala level down
from an average of 240 feet to about 80 feet.
Tyler Durden
writes,
There are several significant factors contributing to
rising food prices, such as extreme weather conditions, biofuel production
and
Wall Street speculation; but the Federal Reserves policies deliberately
threw gasoline all over those brush fires.
Kevin Hall
reports,
The truth
of the matter is that when the Federal Reserve moved on the quantitative
easing, it did export inflation to a lot of these emerging markets
Theres
no doubt that one of the side effects of the weak dollar and quantitative
easing has been rising commodity prices. As food prices increase, food
stamps are obviously going to buy you less food.
On top of that, as food
prices escalate, millions more will need food assistance, right at the point
when the current safety net can least afford it.
In a recent segment, Feeding the Fires of Revolution, CNNs
Fareed Zakaria
says a spike in food prices, ignited, for example, by protests in North
Africa, isnt limited to third-world countries and,
may prove to be the
biggest influencer of global events in 2011.
Higher prices mean more hunger
worldwide.
It is predictable that higher prices and eventual hyperinflation
will lead to famine, misery and social unrest. The rising prices and the
conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East were predictable outcomes of
US
Quantitative Easing.
National Uprisings
Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey,
writing for Pravda.Ru says that under the
worlds present financial and economic system,
It is not a question of not
producing enough food to eat - it is far worse; we have created mechanisms
which exclude countless and growing millions from the right to eat, to work
and to live. This system does not work.
And
people are getting mad and
madder and eventually it will be civil disobedience all over the world as
citizens just get sick of their governments and what is being done to them
by their arrogant leaders.
Tyler Durden
writes in detail about this system and the revolution that is
starting to rise up against it.
He says,
We are witnessing a decentralized
global rebellion against Neo-Liberal economic imperialism. While each
national uprising has its own internal characteristics, each one, at its
core, is about the rising costs of living and lack of financial opportunity
and security.
Throughout the world the situation is the same: increasing
levels of unemployment and poverty as price inflation on food and basic
necessities is soaring.
Whether national populations realize it or not, these uprisings are against
systemic global economic policies that are strategically designed to exploit
the working class, reduce living standards, increase personal debt and
create severe inequalities of wealth.
These global uprisings, which have
only just begun, are the first wave of the inevitable reaction to the
implementation of a centralized worldwide Neo-Feudal economic order. I am
afraid we have yet to see how brutal western governments are going to get
and to what lengths they will go to preserve the status quo.
There are hundreds of millions of people who will not know what hit them and
the government and the press are certainly not warning anyone to prepare for
anything. A huge segment of earths population who has been accustomed to
the good life will be left with a whole lot of nothing when the next
financial collapse occurs.
In the end it looks like its going to be: no
services, no benefits, no jobs, no homes and lots of hungry people with
empty stomachs. The world system based on debt and thin air is about to do a
disappearing act but before it does it is going to go through an agonizing
death dance.
One of the hidden drivers of increasing food prices is the increasing
competition for food around the world as governments and individuals horde
and stockpile. It is bad enough when governments buy large tonnages with
real money, but consider what the United States government is doing to feed
40 million of its citizens with food stamps.
They do not have the money for
that program or any other program, being a bankrupt nation, so they are
borrowing the billions each month and their Federal Reserve is simply
monetizing that debt.
Imagine if everyone could borrow unlimited funds to
buy food what kind of situation we would end up with.
Even though the government is not warning its citizens about any imminent
dangers, it is preparing for disaster. One of the nations largest suppliers
of dehydrated food has
cut loose 99% of their dealers and distributors
because the United States federal government is ordering huge amounts of
freeze-dried foods, 420 million meals, to be exact, or one billion dollars
worth.
Now all we have to do is wait until China gets into the act and puts
some of their small change down on world food exchanges.
