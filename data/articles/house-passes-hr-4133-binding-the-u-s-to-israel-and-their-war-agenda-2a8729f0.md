Without any mainstream media coverage at all, the House of Representatives
passed the United States - Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012
(USIESC).
The USIESC,
written by Eric Cantor, claims there is a need to provide
Israel with unlimited military and financial aid as a result of the
disturbances caused by the Arab Spring.
Israel will have an essentially unlimited amount of funds allocated to them
through
the Federal Reserve Bank.
The country will also enjoy an,
expanded role of NATO that consists of an
enhanced presence at NATO headquarters and exercises.
The USIESC pledges the US governments
commitment to assist Israel in remaining a Jewish State; as well as
protection from the UN if the UN Security Council resolves to hold Israel
accountable to international laws.
The US governments counter-terrorism unit will also aid Israel by any
means.
This USIESC asserts that,
supported by the American people the US
government will repeatedly affirm the special bond between the United
States and Israel and that the two countries have shared values and
shared interests.
If there were ever language to suppose that
there were a merging of these two nations, the USIESC fits that bill.
The
Executive Summary of USIESC says that the following actions to assist
in the defense of Israel are:
-
Provide Israel such support as may be
necessary to increase development and production of joint missile
defense systems, particularly such systems that defend the urgent
threat posed to Israel and United States forces in the region.
-
Provide Israel assistance specifically
for the production and procurement of the Iron Dome defense system
for purposes of intercepting short-range missiles, rockets, and
projectiles launched against Israel.
-
Provide Israel defense articles and
defense services through such mechanisms as appropriate, to include
air refueling tankers, missile defense capabilities, and specialized
munitions.
-
Allocate additional weaponry and
munitions for the forward-deployed United States stockpile in
Israel.
-
Provide Israel additional surplus
defense articles and defense services, as appropriate, in the wake
of the withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq.
-
Strengthen efforts to prevent weapons
smuggling into Gaza pursuant to the 2005 Agreement on Movement and
Access following the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and to protect
against weapons smuggling and terrorist threats from the Sinai
Peninsula.
-
Offer the Israeli Air Force additional
training and exercise opportunities in the United States to
compensate for Israels limited air space.
-
Expand Israels authority to make
purchases under the Foreign Military Financing program on a
commercial basis.
-
Seek to enhance the capabilities of the
United States and Israel to address emerging common threats,
increase security cooperation, and expand joint military exercises.
-
Encourage an expanded role for Israel
within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including an
enhanced presence at NATO headquarters and exercises.
-
Support extension of the long-standing
loan guarantee program for Israel, recognizing Israels unbroken
record of repaying its loans on time and in full.
-
Expand already-close intelligence
cooperation, including satellite intelligence, with Israel.
USIESC goes on
to claim that:
Iran, (3) which has long sought to foment
instability and promote extremism in the Middle East, is now seeking to
(4) exploit the dramatic political transition underway in the region to
undermine governments traditionally aligned with the United States and
support extremist political movements in these countries.
On the contrary, Israel and the US have been the
biggest proponents of violence toward unprovoked nations in recent times.
The collaboration of the US, Israel and NATO,
with help from CIA operatives al-Qaeda and other US funded terrorist groups,
have synthesized fake revolutions (i.e. the Arab Spring) to destabilize
foreign governments and force regime changes.
Right now, al-Qaeda is being used by the Obama administration to force the
Syrian President out of office through repeated attacks and massive killing
of innocent Syrians.
In Africa, specifically the south Sudan region, Obama has teamed up with
Israel to create the new nation of South Sudan by using terrorism to force
their current government out.
USIESC continues
its assault on Iran:
At the same time, (5) Iran may soon attain
a nuclear weapons capability, a development that would fundamentally
threaten vital American interests, destabilize the region, encourage
regional nuclear proliferation, further empower and embolden Iran, (6)
the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism, and (7) provide it the
tools to threaten its neighbors, including Israel.
Although publicly, both the Obama administration
and the Israeli government have admitted that Iran has absolutely no
intention of building nuclear weapons. Both governments assume that by using
words like they may or they might denotes a definite intention to do so.
The Mullahs that have ultimate authority in Iran have stated numerous times
that the acquisition and use of nuclear weapons goes against the law of
Islam. Independent studies, outside of the US and Israeli reach, have also
confirmed that not only does Iran not have nuclear weapons at present, but
are not perusing their allocation.
To justify the fabricated need to assist Israel in remaining safe the
USIESC states:
As a result, (8) the strategic environment
that has kept Israel secure and safeguarded United States national
interests for the past 35 years has eroded.
At the present time, Israel is in possession of
an estimated 200 - 300 nuclear weapons.
They are the covert superpower of the world.
Israel also enjoys one of the most intensive and explicit armies in the
world. While Israel continues to invade the sovereign nations that surround
them, they are not being invaded themselves.
The USIESC is a propaganda piece of legislation designed to set the stage
for full military support of Israel when they launch an unprovoked strike
against Iran. While now, there are campaigns to coerce a fake grassroots
effort to force a regime change in Iran, the inevitability of war
declarations are looming in the distance.
China and Russia have made it clear that they have absolutely no intention
of ending their relations with Iran.
The distractions in the mainstream media concerning Obama are just that. The
sudden inflation of gay rights in the political arena and other nonsensical
and unimportant social memes are being touted as if they will define our
nation.
The USIESC has clearly set a precedent and definition of who America is.
The Obama administration, under careful control of the global Elite, is
consolidating powers with Israel in a joint effort to take over the world .
. . by toppling one government at a time.
