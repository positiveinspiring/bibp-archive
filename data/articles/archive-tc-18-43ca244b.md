Question: We just had lunch with a member from Australia who tells
us that there are the 'good-guy' aliens, and the 'bad-guy' aliens,
and they're both implanting entities on this plane. Could Awareness
go into this subject of implants a bit and explain what the purpose
of these are and how entities can detect them and how they can get
rid of them, if possible?
A: This Awareness indicates that often entities are implanted by these
aliens with an implant that is either inserted up through the
nostril into an area near the optic nerve, or will be given an
implant in the back of the head near the medulla oblongata, or it
will be near the back of the head in the area of the right ear,
behind the ear; that these can be detected by certain means as
described by Whitley Strieber in his lectures, wherein he shows
certain scan pictures of his own head where the implants were, and
entities can see their location.
This Awareness indicates that there is also a kind of standing rule
that anyone who has such an implant should not go near military
bases because these implants can be monitored by military guards and
they are under orders to shoot anyone coming near with an implant;
that this as being expressed or explained in the
[William]
Cooper
material. There is, in some cases, the possibility of removing
implants through operations; these, of course, can be costly and
dangerous. This is in reference to these material implants that are
implanted by the physical aliens.
This Awareness indicates that your friend today referred to the use
of these implants as being able to cause pain, and this was correct.
They are also able to cause disorientation, and to cause an entity
to hear voices, or to get directions or instructions. It is likened
unto having some kind of radio contact with an entity, with the
contacts being implanted in the head so that the entity thinks these
are his own thoughts. These also serve as monitoring devices,
whereby the entity can be located at any time.
This Awareness indicates that this is in reference to the physical
implants by those physical aliens on Earth. The so-called good-guy
aliens, those entities from the Pleiades, also have their way of
monitoring and communicating ethereally and psychically with humans,
and that they also have a kind of implant that they produce but it
does not take the form of a physical implant. It is an ethereal or
astral type of implant.
This Awareness indicates generally, this would be more like an
ethereal implant into the ethereal body, and it is for those who are
especially open to receive instructions from higher spiritual guides
so that there can be a closer communication and link between them
and the higher spiritual guides; that the aliens from
the Pleiades
have a direct link or quality relating to beings of a higher
dimension.
These being the Elohim, from whence humans were partially
formed and the Pleiades types as more highly evolved humans, or
those which might be termed angels, and the combination of the
genetics that came from the Elohim and angelic qualities mixing with
the more mundane qualities of Cro-magnon man and the earlier forms
of humankind on Earth, the Neanderthal and stone-age types, has
gradually brought about the evolution of the homosapien, but the
homosapien as also being a kind of mixture, began evolving toward a
higher spiritual path with each successive generation, and it is
continuing to do so, and in doing so, there is that vibration that
allows for closer and closer communication to those Elohim and to
those guides of the Pleiades.
This Awareness indicates that these reflect into and from dimensions
paralleling your physical dimension, so that much of what you sense
as your guides are also higher vibratory frequencies that correlate
to Pleiadian types of human or what you may wish to call angels;
that these, when in physical form, may be seen as angelic or as
human types, depending on what form they wish to take. In ages past
they took on the form of winged angels of great beauty, but in more
recent times they take on the form of humans of great beauty, having
spacecraft. These entities are capable of taking on the form that is
appropriate. These are your ancestors and forbearers of your race.
This Awareness indicates that the so-called implants which this
entity referred to in regard to these 'good-guys', are not actually
physical implants. They are there in the consciousness levels of the
ethereal body, to allow you to have closer contact, and these are
there also for that time when things require communication and
contact with them, so that indeed, you can receive instructions and
the blessings that they would have to offer.
This Awareness indicates that so long as your motives, intentions
and purposes are of the highest, and your qualities are truly
spiritual, these entities remain in contact and keep the lines of
contact open in a protective manner. It is important that you do not
move into grossness in your behavior, or it will shut down the
contacts.
This Awareness indicates that the question of the implants
by the physical aliens on Earth as to how to get rid of these; it is
possible for entities not to be controlled by these things, if they
have their motives, purposes and spiritual intentions focused on the
highest spiritual thing they can imagine, whatever they perceive to
be God, the Creator, or the most spiritual aspect of creation.
By having themselves so focused, it tends to disorient those who
would seek to control these entities. This Awareness indicates that
there is a strong likelihood that in the event of a crisis, a global
crisis relating to aliens and a conflict between humans and aliens,
that those who have alien implants of a physical nature will be
rounded up and confined for fear that they might in some way be
agents, or become agents of the alien factor. This Awareness
indicates that the next question may be asked...
Question: In relation to the
implants, they're putting out that
nearly 58%, like Strieber, are convinced that whatever their
experiences were with these aliens, it has in some way prompted a
kind of illumination, revelatory, or cosmic consciousness
experience. Is is true with these negative type aliens who lift
entities up to inspect them and so forth and insert physical
implants?
A: This Awareness indicates that these entities are inspecting
individual, human individuals, in part for their own scientific
research. In part they have been carrying on long experiments in
trying to create a kind of new being which will allow their race to
merge with humans, because their race is deteriorating from
excessive repeated cloning. Each generation or each clone becomes
less vital, losing its vitality and they are seeking a way to
recharge their race by somehow commingling with the new vital energy
of humans in a kind of genetic recreation for the purpose of
bringing about a new creation, a new being.
That this, however, is not what this Awareness has referred to as
the new being of the New Age, for this would bring about certain
benefits to the offspring, having the benefit of much of the
intelligence of the aliens. It would benefit the aliens in giving
them much of the compassion and passion and feelings of humans which
they lack, therefore, it would be a new race or a new being but it
would not add greatly to the spiritual aspect. The new being would
not gain that much spiritually.
This Awareness indicates the need for humans to have some kind of
spiritual upliftment is essential if there is to be any merging with
aliens toward the creation of another species of beings; that for
this reason, the need to move toward those beings of a higher
spiritual nature is imperative and entities should be most cautious
about any allegiance or alliances formed with those aliens who do
not have the higher spiritual values.
Question: Well, is it correct then that there was something
intrinsic in the experience; that the aliens imposed a sense of
spiritual evolvement in those they abducted?
A: This Awareness indicates that it appears the aliens have, in the
experience of abducting individuals, introduced a certain sense of
confusion and have taken away their feeling of free will and
personal destiny, and that many entities will transfer this feeling
into a need for greater spiritual dependency on something higher
than themselves, and they will interpret this as though the aliens
have given them something spiritual.
Others will recall or will feel
from the experience, that they have been greatly violated at having
had their own free will tampered with; that they were essentially
raped by aliens, which in fact, is more close to the truth for many,
and these entities will tend to be more fearful of aliens and will
have many disturbing days, weeks, years of confusion that follow
abductions.
There are many entities whose lives are totally ruined from having
been abducted. Others, who upon having their abduction occur in
which perhaps they were not violated so heavily, or they were well
protected from the memory, will distort the experience as something
that was quite beneficial to them. You will recall that Strieber was
told by the aliens, in fact, chastised severely, for having eaten
chocolate.
This Awareness indicates that these entities do not like
the glandular substance taken from entities who have eaten
chocolate. It is disturbing to them. The entity did not have his
glandular substances taken from him, and therefore was not violated,
did not have the serious repercussions that many others would have
in a similar situation.
This Awareness indicates that other foods that disturb the glandular
substance as far as the aliens are concerned are sugar, sweet foods,
and spinach and rhubarb, hot spicy foods, such as chili peppers;
that the aliens do not like certain of these energies affecting the
glandular substances and therefore, do not gain the benefits, so
they are less likely to bother with the glandular extractions from
such entities.
This Awareness indicates that the need for entities
to be cautious in regard to any contact with UFOs cannot be
overstated, for these entities are not here as guardian angels. This
was the reputation earned by the Pleiades type, not those from
Orion
or the Zeta Reticuli, these entities being more interested in what
they can get from humans for their own benefit.
Question: In regard to these abductions, is there a factor involved
where there is agreement on some level given to these aliens? For
example, our friend Michael had an abduction experience as a child,
and he's questioned this. He was lifted up by this blue beam, I
believe it was, and he's positive they have returned many times, or
at least several times since, now that he's grown up.
We have
discussed this with him, and he wonders whether he gave some sort of
agreement originally as a child, or was it necessary to give
agreement for this experience to happen. He seems to think it was a
violation, but he says it was a great experience and he wouldn't
have missed it for anything, because he feels that there was some
kind of illumination given.
A: This Awareness indicates that indeed there is a kind of exchange
that occurs in which the glandular substances are taken, but at the
same time there are certain influences; this as difficult to
explain; that there are certain psychic or psychological influences
that are returned to the entity in a manner that works somewhat like
osmosis, in which the entity's intellect can be enhanced by such a
contact.
This Awareness indicates that generally, these entities
tend to look for those who are either lonely or confused, who are
not clearly or strongly grounded in any particular individuality. In
other words, that wherein an entity has a strong individuality, they
are less likely to be a candidate for abduction, but wherein an
entity is relatively open and receptive to environmental influences
of a wide order, in other words, one who is in need of help, in need
of friendship, in need of clarity or in need of something stable in
his or her life; these are those types that are more likely
candidates for abduction and these entities will tend to look for
those types.
This Awareness indicates it is best to see these entities, these
aliens as being hunters, that essentially they are out hunting for
sources of glandular substances, and do not want to experience any
personal harassment from the action, so they generally will attempt
to find entities who are alone, or to themselves, of the type that
is more unbalanced or unstable or socially disoriented at the time.
This Awareness indicates that by these terms 'unbalanced, disabled
or disoriented', it does not imply this to be a permanent state of
mind, it is referring to perhaps only a temporary state of mind.
If an entity, for example, is walking through the park, that entity
is alone. If the entity, walking through the park is monitored by
the aliens and is sensed to have a great number of friends who are
waiting for him or a family, this would tend to hold off the alien
abduction more so than if the entity is going home to his own place
and no one would really miss him if he disappeared for an hour or
two.
This Awareness indicates that they are able, by their devices,
to determine such things, and these things are often considered in
an abduction. It will depend of course, on how anxious they are to
abduct, how willing they are to risk, and other factors.
Question: In the case of a child then, who probably was violated and
gave no permission, doesn't the High Self of the child, or the
guardian angel, or whatever name one cares to call it, wouldn't it
protect the child from that violation or does it see somehow the
long-term growth of the child and see that there might be some
benefit in the experience, and allows it to happen?
A:
This Awareness indicates it will protect the child's soul, care for
and comfort the child's soul. It cannot interfere with the action.
It may protect the child prior to such an abduction to prevent it
from occurring, but if there is a reason in a karmic sense for the
child to experience a negative event of this nature; perhaps the
child participated in some kind of torture to others, or perhaps the
child simply needs to develop a greater self-awareness, the higher
guardian angel of a child may allow an event to occur that is
traumatic to the child.
This Awareness wishes to explain something that is not understood.
Guardian angels are not inclined to interfere unless one asks for
such help. It is part of a general rule by which they are directed
to abide. If there is the request for help by a guardian angel or
higher being, then they are free to help, if it is in the fate of
the child to be helped, or if it is something preordained that the
child must go through this experience in order to learn something
that was preordained prior to the child's birth in physical form;
even then, the guardian angel or higher spiritual guide will allow
this to occur. They are powerless to stop it.
This Awareness indicates that it may, for example, be part of the
child's own free will to return to this plane, to pay back certain
karmic debts, by enduring certain pain or suffering or action at the
hands of some force, not necessarily the one whom the child had
previously harmed, which calls for that karmic repayment.
This
Awareness indicates that this is not to say that entities should
simply say: "Oh, well, that's just the kid's karma", for it is also
given that a child or an entity having karma, even though the higher
forces may not be able to remove the entity's karma without the
entity showing remorse and requesting the removal of a karma, even
though this may not be possible from higher beings, if an individual
of physical form takes on someone else's karma by rescuing, by
helping or by carrying that karma, the entity then can be freed of
the karma.
This Awareness indicates that it then becomes a situation in which
the one who rescued or took on the karma is obligated to have the
burden of that karma in place of, in lieu of the other, and though
it may be difficult and painful to carry the karma of another, there
are also greater rewards for having done so.
This Awareness
indicates that these rewards do not always come because the entity
may then turn to the child and say: "You owe me your life! From now
on you do what I say!", or something else, and thus the rescuer
becomes the tyrant over the rescued, and of course, this is not a
proper role for one who has rescued another, and the rescuer would
not then be a likely candidate for greater reward for having
rescued, if the entity is attempting to gain greater reward on his
or her own.
This Awareness indicates that it is somewhat difficult to explain
karma because karma has to do much with what is felt within an
individual in regard to an action which the individual is involved
in. If an individual is involved in an action of rescuing another
and has no ulterior motive, either at the time or thereafter, and
simply does it out of spontaneous reaction, indeed, even though the
entity may suffer from that rescue, such as the young boy who made
sure that his teenage girlfriend got off the tracks, but in so doing
was run over by the train; this entity gained good karma.
He has
taken on what could have been her karma, and therefore, the entity
as having good karma for his action of saving her.
This Awareness indicates that generally speaking, the giving and
receiving of self to benefit others or to benefit self as that which
serves as a kind of basis for karmic debt or for karmic earning, and
therefore, entities may simply weigh and balance from their
intention and motives if they wish to judge whether an action was
karmic, negatively or positively.
Question: It would seem that any abductee would almost have to
define their experience in the best possible light, such as
spiritual enlightenment, in order to live with it psychologically;
but does the event itself, encourage spiritual growth because of its
intensity?
A: This Awareness indicates that this will depend on the individual and
how the individual wishes to relate to the event. In most cases the
individual does not recall much of the event because the event is
usually of such a nature that the aliens wipe out the memory on a
conscious level through the use of chemicals or drugs and also
through the use of certain trauma involved in the event.
They also
have the benefit of frequency programming, whereby certain
frequencies are used that can totally distort the memory or an
event, so that while the event is occurring, the brainwaves are
being scrambled simultaneously so that the brain does not record the
event clearly.
This Awareness indicates that because some of the events of the
abduction may be interesting, consciously remembered and even
pleasant or intriguing, entities may remember only that part and
parts that are more of a violative nature may be repressed into
subconscious levels and not remembered at all.
That for some, they
are not recorded deeply in the subconscious, or they are recorded
deeply in the subconscious and still have a kind of gnawing effect
on the entity's emotions, causing a feeling of dread or fear or
anxiety in regard to the event, and depending on the individual and
the degree of memory, dread, fear or anxiety, each individual will
have a slightly different attitude toward the abduction.
Some entities can take it better than others. Most entities do not
like the experience and have a negative feeling toward what
happened, and see it as a kind of violation. Some entities will
experience it and remember only the best and will then attempt to
make the best of it, remember it in the best light and express it as
something wonderful.
Question: In regard to implants, there's been literature circulating
around that doctors have been told around the country to send X-rays
when they run across an implant, to a place in California, I
believe, which has records of tens of thousands of these, and the
stories that it is impossible to surgically remove these without
killing the entity.
Now, my question is, if this is true, is there
anything, herbal for example, or otherwise, entities could take that
would remove these? One member, for example, wrote in that she has
heard that germanium dissolves implants.
A: This Awareness indicates that it does appear there is a benefit in
the taking of germanium in regard to this; it appears that it would
need to be taken over an extended period of time to have such an
effect. This Awareness indicates that the surgical removal of
implants is on occasion possible, especially that which is implanted
behind the right ear.
An implant by the medulla as that which would
be nearly impossible to remove, and an implant near the optic nerve
would be quite difficult, if not impossible, to remove without
serious damage to the individual.
This Awareness indicates that it
would appear that the use of germanium over a period of
approximately one year, taken on a regular basis, in accordance with
normal dosage, would be sufficient in most cases to defuse the
effectiveness of an implant. This Awareness wishes a pause. (Long
pause)
This Awareness indicates that there appear to be other substances
that can be beneficial, but these are not seen clearly at this time,
that this may become clear and available at a future time.
Question: B.A. sent in a copy of a question and answer session with
Dr. Fred Bell who is a pretty well-known UFO expert who goes around
lecturing, and he claims that these neuro-implant transmitters in
the brain are planted by the Greys, using holographic laser
equipment. Is that true? Is that the method they use?
A:
This Awareness indicates that this appears to be a good description
of the method used. It is a kind of projection and creation at the
same time. It is not an action so much as making a hole and asking
it in, it is more likened unto creating a laser-sized incision or
hole between the molecules to the place for implant, and then
projecting on that light or laser track the information or coding
that creates the implant in that spot, that it is first created in a
kind of holographic vision and then it materializes as a substance.
Question: This information comes from a question and answer
session
with this Dr. Fred Bell, and the questioner says:
"Didn't you
mention in Hawaii that you had been in Dulce and you were going to
take videos of level 7 and 8?"
And Dr. Bell says:
"Yes, I've been to
Dulce. I'm getting ready to take a film crew in there with
helicopters. I will go there with the assistance of the Pleiadians.
Brad Steiger and I are hoping to get video of their operations, like
on levels 7 and 8, where they are crossbreeding with humans and are
cloning themselves."
Does Awareness see that this will actually be brought about, that
entities can actually bring video tapes back of some of these levels
where these aliens are running experiments there?
A: This Awareness indicates that this could occur, only with the help
of the Pleiadeans, that this as that which is planned and which may
take place. There is some indication of it being successful. There
is also some indication of failure. It is at this time seen as being
likely. There are some dangers involved. However, the assistance of
the Pleiadians as that which minimizes the danger.
There is seen no other way by which this can be accomplished. These
entities in fact, would dematerialize, moving into other dimensions,
and then appearing in those areas for the filming purposes.
Question: From this same paper the questioner asks: 'We have heard
that the Greys were robotic and therefore did not carry any spirit."
Dr. Bell replies:
"Well, judging from what I know and how they
behave, I know that they often times implant a human being and then
cause an abortion at three months. They take that fetus into a
laboratory and grow it from there. I know they have created robotic
types which are in the underground caverns at Dulce."
Does Awareness see that information as being valid, and if so, how
prevalent is this, creating abortions women and taking the fetus at
three months?
A: This Awareness indicates that this is a common practice. It is a way
by which they gain the genes that they need and use for their
various genetic experiments. It is part of the operation they use in
the cloning processes. It helps them to take some of these
substances of the genes and to grow new clones of themselves with
these energies.
It is a situation in which they manage to take on
certain human qualities though the fetuses and thereby alter their
own nature. This is part of their effort to bring about a new
life-form for themselves to inhabit the Earth with greater ease.
This Awareness wishes you to understand that these entities are not
well adapted to the atmosphere on Earth. It is for this reason that
they live underground. It is also because of this reason that
entities aboard an alien spacecraft will feel a sense of nausea,
because the atmosphere is not suitable for human life.
The
atmosphere being different, and that by arranging the molecules and
genetic engineering to commingle human, and alien lifeforms, this new
creation which they are working on can better adapt to the new
environment which is being prepared on the outer surface of the
Earth.
This Awareness indicates that this essentially relating to
the weakening of the ozone layer, the diminishment of oxygen, and
the general changes that are going on environmentally. Essentially
the aliens are helping through the environmental disturbances to
rearrange the environment for their own needs.
