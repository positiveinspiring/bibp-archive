The benefit of the new information is that the world around you will finally
make sense. Hot, flat, and crowded Thomas L. Friedman will finally
know what planet
George W. Bush is on.
Bush lost the war on terrorism and the war in
Iraq, but is winning the war on the environment.
At this point, it is advantageous to consider the efforts of writer
Andrew Hitchcock, author of
The History of the House of Rothschild:
"The Rothschilds have been in control of the
world for a very long time, their tentacles reaching into many aspects
of our daily lives, and are the hidden hand behind all the social
cataclysms in history.
The French and American Revolution, the Civil
War, World Wars, the Industrial Revolution, the Federal Reserve and our
consumer society.
Rothschild policies include total ruthlessness
and as Frederic Morton writes in the Preface to The Rothschilds,
For the last one hundred and fifty years,
the history of the House of Rothschild has been to an amazing degree the
backstage history of Western Europe... The overwhelming success of the
Rothschilds lay in their willingness to do what had to be done.
What follows is the history that has been
intentionally left out of our textbooks.
The historical research by Toqueville, Chartier
and Hitchcock if examined without prejudice supports a prima facie case that
the House of Rothschild orchestrated the French and American Revolutions to
create the middle class (consumers) for the purpose of trashing the planet.
Our last President Bush, connected to the House of Rothschild Global
Financial Empire, was deadly serious when, after rejecting the global
climate change targets of the July 2008 G8 summit, he said,
"Goodbye, from the (then) world's biggest
polluter." [1]
Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.
John F. Kennedy
In the early 20th century historians (such as
Charles Beard), looking for the social forces they thought controlled
history, emphasized industrialization and urbanization. These were forces
unleashed by the industrial revolution and the textile industry. [2]
By the mid 20th century, attention turned to the
broader concept of "modernization," which included industrialization,
urbanization, psychological changes and changes in values.
Eric Hobsbawm called "modernization
(Consumerism),
"probably the most important event in human history.
Consumerism Needs the
Middle Class
If you were living in the 18th century looking for humans to consume the
resources of the planet, where would you find them?
Answer: 95-97percent of the population of Feudal Society.
The Third Estate
had potential consumers but first they would need to be enlightened with a
philosophy and movement based on respect for the dignity of man, concern for
his welfare, and the creation of favorable conditions for a just social
life.
Men began to think government was not something kings exercised by divine
right and then Maximilien Robespierre started the French Revolution. The
order was given to Robespierre in book form by Rothschilds agent
Adam Weishaupt and his associate Xavier Zwack. [3]
At the beginning of the Revolution, Kings, Monarchs and the despots of our
history books held supreme power; by the time it ended, the human rights
movement replaced centuries of tyranny and oppression for the common man.
Is that possible?
Revisionists are still trying to explain why the despots of our history
books wouldnt use the Guillotine to dispense with such a heretical
movement.
Roger Chartier writes in
The Cultural Origins of The French Revolution,
the popular notion that the Enlightenment caused the Revolution makes the
mistake of post hoc ergo propter hoc:
"after the fact, therefore because of the
fact."
Thus, Chartier and other historians claim it was
the French Revolution that made the Enlightenment.
The Declaration of the Rights of Man is often seen as the quintessential
Enlightenment document but the declaration called for a meritocratic social
order, not an egalitarian one. Equality was conspicuously absent.
The revisionists are consistent in dismissing the Marxist interpretation,
but without a 20th century perspective on environmental damage they have no
systemic theory explaining the events in late 18th century France.
Ecocide was a pivotal and necessary part of the
Rothschild plan for a
New World Order.
Liberté, Egalité,
Fraternité
In the summer of 1789 when France rose up in revolt it wasnt over
intellectual, social or political issues; it was food. The country was in
the midst of a famine caused by abnormal weather.
The common man was having trouble developing his natural talent and
potential because he was hungry.
"The French Revolution will only be the
darkness of night to those who see it in isolation; only the times which
preceded it will give the light to illuminate it.
The whole social edifice of Ancien
Regime France collapsed at a single blow, and the fact that this was
in the midst of one of the worst El Niño episodes of the millennium is
something that should be taken into account when examining this
history.
de Tocqueville 1952, p. 249
September 11, 1814 should be examined as well.
[4]
The rise of humanism and the social injustices in the 18th century did not
create the revolutionary brew that saw the overthrow of the French monarchy.
The House of Rothschild and the weather changed the course of history.
When the French government on the verge of bankruptcy from the seven years
wars was unable to provide famine relief, public frustration erupted into
violent demonstrations and the French Revolution.
Of course most despots would call for an inquisition and blame the peasants
for the worst El Niño episode in history.
In 1795 when the people rebelled against a provision of the National
Convention, Napoleon simply fired a whiff of grape shot into the mob, and
the rebellion was over. [5]
Why did the House of Rothschild allow the revolution to succeed?
Answer: There were not enough consumers in the First and Second Estates in
18th century Feudal Society to weaken the planet.
The House of
Rothschild Global Financial Empire
The vast accumulation of wealth, financial and natural resources of the
House of Rothschild is legendary.
"And there was no news more precious than
the (predetermined) outcome at Waterloo..."
Considered the turning point in history,
exploiting the Battle of Waterloo gave the Rothschild family complete
financial control of Europe, and soon after, the world. England would set up
a new Bank of England, with Nathan Mayer Rothschild in control.
According to one source in the late 1800s, when the planet was still in
ecological balance,
"it was estimated the House of Rothschild
controlled almost half the wealth of the world [6]
That would be real wealth: raw materials,
commodities, copper, iron ore, petroleum, lead, copper, silver and gold.
How much are they worth today?
Almost half of the world's fiat wealth about $500 trillion of the fiat
currency (monopoly money) they created out of thin air to finance our
consumer society. [7]
And their real wealth, where is it now?
Used up, as in consumed, by the middle class so former members of the Third
Estate (serfs and slaves) could have houses, cars, RVs, TVs and DVDs - the
affordable things we take for granted which put the planet on the bridge to
Ecocide.
One of the more absurd notions that found its way into the history books and
the writings of economic experts, is that somehow the International Bankers
(swindlers and scoundrels of history) were made wealthier accumulating the
monopoly money they printed.
The swindlers and scoundrels wealth, not yours or mine, was eventually cut,
mined and hauled away, so that Americans could have that cheap stuff that
is currently trashing the planet.
During the last 100 years those swindlers were able to distort the structure
of relative prices; generate misallocations of labor and capital throughout
the economy; rationalize new governmental interventions in the face of the
market "instability" manipulate the patterns of and the profits from
international trade which resulted in the Industrial Revolution, the Great
Depression, the
stagflation of the 1970s, the
dot-com and the housing
market bubbles
which resulted in unprecedented prosperity for the middle
class
and $500 trillion of monopoly money for the House of Rothschild.
Did Woodrow Wilson ruin his country when he signed The Federal
Reserve Act of 1913 and made the middle class prosperous beyond precedent in
the most powerful nation in the world?
Yes, because prosperous beyond precedent was unprecedented environmental
damage for the planet.
Capitalism never made
sense unless the goal was ecocide
The ideal and the principle of the market economy of Capitalism was never
fulfilled.
What is called capitalism is a distorted, twisted and deformed system of
increasingly limited market relationships as well as market processes
hampered and repressed by state controls and regulations. And overlaying
this entire system are the ideologies of 18th-century mercantilism,
19th-century socialism, and 20th-century welfare statism.
Professor Ebeling, the Ludwig von Mises professor of Economics at Hillsdale
College, understood something was wrong when he wrote:
the perverse development and evolution of
historical capitalism, the institutions necessary for a truly
free-market economy have been either undermined or prevented from
emerging.
But when he claimed,
it is the principles and the meaning of a
free-market economy that must be rediscovered in order to overcome the
burden of historical capitalism and save liberty.
He should have written principles must be
rediscovered in order to save the planet from ecocide.
It didnt matter if we listened to Keynes, Friedman or Mises; or for that
matter anyone from the Rothschild-funded Austrian School of Economics,
consumerism never made economic, environmental, or common sense. [8]
Even conscious consumers consume, as in use up the resources of the planet.
Revolution
The American and French Revolutions made consumers out of 97% of the
population who could now afford, thanks to those scoundrels behind the
Federal Reserve, their own castle with all the furnishings and a two-car
garage for their mobile pollution devices - the personal automobile.
[9]
Let me repeat, since 1910 the
House of Rothschild and
the Rockefellers have
exchanged their real wealth for 600 trillion of
fiat currency (monopoly
money) they printed so former members of the Third Estate (serfs and slaves)
could have houses, cars, RVs, TVs and DVDs - the stuff which put the
planet on the bridge to Ecocide.
The only thing dumber is when a poor person in the Peoples Republic of
China loans about $4,000 to everyone in the (rich) USA. [10]
Rockefeller philanthropy wasnt limited to dimes.
Footnotes
[1] If trashing the planet was his
military objective, our last President Bush was not stupid, but a
brilliant commander-in-chief waging an all-out war on biodiversity,
animals and rainforests. He wanted to drill in the ANWR to trash
Americas last Arctic Wilderness. Sonar Testing is about torturing
whales and dolphins. And the Border Fence that keeps everything out but
illegals will disrupt an extraordinary source of biological diversity
along the 2,000-mile long region.
[2] By 1850 the United States following the
lead of England built their own industrial revolution around textiles.
There arose a great demand for the one crop that does more damage to the
environment than planting coffee or even tobacco
Cotton. Today, our
planet is in desperate trouble. Earth is suffocating as large tracts of
rain forests disappear. Pollution, poisons and chemicals are killing the
planet. These problems could have been avoided if the British textile
industry hadnt suddenly discovered Cotton.

[4] El Niño and mankind before the 20th century by ELinacre,
August 25, 1814, British troops captured the nations capital during the
War of 1812, setting fire to buildings in retaliation for American wins.
A tornado struck as the government buildings burned, killing 30 soldiers
and many local residents. One British historian noted, "More British
soldiers were killed and wounded by this stroke of nature than from all
the firearms the American troops had mustered in the ineffectual defense
of the city." The account in "Washington Weather" tells of a British
admiral who asked a local woman whether the storm was typical of the
weather "in this infernal country." The lady told him that it was a
storm specially sent by God "to drive our enemies from the city."
September 11, 1814 the decisive battle of the War of 1812.
