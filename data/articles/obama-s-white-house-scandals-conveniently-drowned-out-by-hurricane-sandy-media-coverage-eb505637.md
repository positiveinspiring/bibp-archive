Throughout the past week, the media has
been focused almost completely on the ongoing developments of Hurricane
Sandy, which has already taken the lives of at least 62 people and caused
tens of billions of dollars in damage, according to reports.
But nonstop coverage of this "perfect storm" has
also conveniently diverted attention away from several perfect political
storms in the White House, including the infamous Benghazi scandal and the
"Fast and Furious" gun-smuggling operation, both of which just so happen to
have the potential, albeit the very small potential, to have key Obama
administration players charged with war crimes.
Just as
some of the sordid details were finally starting to come to light about
the Obama administration's treasonous actions following the September 11,
2012 attack in Libya that resulted in the deaths of U.S. Ambassador J.
Christopher Stevens, U.S. State Department communications specialist and
former U.S. Air Force veteran Sean Smith, as well as two U.S.
Marines, along comes Hurricane Sandy to redirect focus and paint the
administration in a new light just before election day.
The same goes for
the "Fast and Furious" scandal, which was given the back burner as the
storm of the century came burrowing in off the East Coast, causing untold
damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Some reports indicate that
it could take weeks or even months for many of the hardest hit areas to
fully recover, while millions of people living throughout the region are
still without power.
What will happen in the meantime with the Obama
administration and its role in
smuggling firearms to Mexican drug cartels?
None of this, of course, is meant to downplay the storm disaster in any way
- Hurricane Sandy was very real, and the extensive damage it has already
caused is truly devastating.
And yet at the same time, many news sources have
become so preoccupied with storm-related issues that the Obama
administration's role in these various scandals is barely even on their
radars anymore, if it ever even was in the first place.
On the flip side, the American people still seem to have their gazes fixed
on the scandals, at least to some degree, regardless of the media's
acquiescence.
Particularly in the internet realm, there is
much talk about bringing all the grim details of the scandals to bear before
the election, despite the Obama administration's clear intention of sweeping
them under the rug until after the election.
