Is Russia Today (RT)
Part of The Controlled Media Matrix
and The
Imposition of Global Government?
There is a storm coming.
It is not hyperinflation I'm speaking of. It's
not even global government. It is the KIND of global government that is
being created. Follow along with me and you will understand EXACTLY what
"they" are doing and how they intend to do it.
We arrive at these conclusions as we always do, using facts to intuit
patterns. The patterns are what we call the dominant social themes of the
elite.
There are a number of recent patterns we've identified that we haven't been
able to put into a fully cohesive order. That's how it is when you spend
your time watching the top elites, the ones that control central banking and
are worth collectively many TRILLIONS of dollars.
They are not exactly a different species. But F. Scott Fitzgerald had
it right.
The "rich"... the REAL rich are different than
you and me.
-
They spend their professional lives on elaborate plots that shake the world.
-
They think nothing of displacing or even murdering mass numbers of people.
-
They plan inter-generationally.
-
They operate an "open conspiracy."
-
They
control almost the entire world with the exception perhaps of Somalia,
Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Only recently have they hammered Iraq and
Libya and are in the process of instituting forced Islamic conformity in
Syria - all under the cloak of instituting "democracy."
And now they are making their move. What we call
the
Internet Reformation has forced their hand, in my view. They are
moving quickly to create
world government.
This article is about the KIND of world government they are creating.
I became aware of this while doing research on Russia Today (RT), rapidly
emerging to join the world's leading TV and 'Net-based TV networks. I've
appeared on RT but scaled back my appearances over the past year - despite
very kind requests for interviews - because I was vaguely uncomfortable.
Now I know why.
What I discovered is that RT is part of a Hegelian Dialectic to implement a
certain kind of world government. Top leaders of Russian-based media moguls
affiliated with RT behind the scenes appear to come from the former KGB
(along with Vladamir Putin).
Additionally, they are members of,
...and other elite facilities.
That's a fact. Look it up.
And lately RT has begun using the language of Occupy Wall Street, apparently
a
George Soros-funded and controlled false-flag operation.
RT supports programs by Julian Assange, a former writer for the
British Round Table (Rothschild)
controlled Economist magazine, which used to award him prizes.
WikiLeaks is probably another false flag, in our view.
RT, one of the fastest growing media conglomerates in the world, is a
Russian Intel operation that puts libertarian faces on their channel for
purposes of credibility, in my humble opinion. But it is not a free-market
channel.
Yes, dear reader, I believe it is part of a pincer movement to create a
certain kind of world government and simply another cog in the international
media matrix - right up there with the CNNs and Fox News networks of the
world.
They are just playing at the margins - closest in appearance to
free-market biased news reporting.
I am not going to appear on RT anymore. Libertarians and freedom-loving
types in the alternative media should think hard before participating in RT
programs, as well.
Leave RT appearances to the "other part" of the alternative media.
I won't name names, but strip out the libertarian appearances and you are
left with a certain kind of "alternative media" guest.
-
It is a guest raging against Wall
Street, Goldman Sachs and the corruption of capitalism.
-
It is a guest seeking government control
of money.
-
It is a guest who seeks to use the
genocidal power of the US penitentiary Gulag to "punish" Wall Street
bankers.
-
It is a guest who seeks "control" of
central banking rather than its downfall.
-
It is a guest who would not be opposed
to neo-Pecora hearings of the sort that started the full-fledged
downfall of modern capitalism in the 1930s. These hearings are
apparently already being prepared in the bowels of Washington DC
committees.
These hearings are of integral importance
because they will fully bring capitalism under control of the public sector.
Today's Wall Street is bad enough. I have no
sympathy for it. Henceforth, politicians will control all aspects of finance
under the further control (at arm's length) of the top banking elites.
The government being formed in the US is the government that will rule the
world.
It will be run by the power elite from,
...and
probably Jerusalem with sub-nodes in,
All these entities shall be powers unto themselves, enclaves separate from
the nation-states in which they reside.
The government now being formed will have a certain character:
-
It will be a government where legalisms
outweigh natural law.
-
It will be globalist but highly
nationalist in its vocabulary.
-
It will be free-market in its
positioning but in actuality, control will reside with the
government itself when it comes to money and other issues of real
import.
-
It will control all aspects of people's
lives including, most importantly, their consumption of energy.
Now that I understand RT's involvement, the
strategy is clear.
Just like the increasingly controlled
non-libertarian and leftist portion of the alternative media, at least some
of RT's rhetoric directly or indirectly bolsters efforts to:
-
Undermine what is left of the capitalist
system via Occupy Wall Street and other such movements.
-
Jail the domestic banking class.
-
Create a national central bank under
control of the "people."
-
Put money under control of the
"government."
-
Put industry under control of the
government (see GM) but let it function with some day-to-day
latitude.
-
Elevate the status of the military and
make a cult of its "heroes."
-
Further develop an invasive security
apparatus to protect people from "terrorism."
Are you getting the picture yet? All this is
speculative but it fits together.
The government being formed is a totalitarian NAZI-style government. Not a
communist one as people have been led to expect... and fear.
And eventually, it will devolve into mere totalitarianism and even genocide.
But the "ism" is important for now because it is going to be how we will get
there.
The totalitarian state is being built as I write. Over at LewRockwell.com,
Paul Rosenberg recently posted an article entitled
It's Happening Faster
Than Even I Thought.
It begins as follows:
2012 has been a banner year for amoral marketers and soul-dead overseers,
and the situation is probably much worse than you realize.
Allow me to illustrate it briefly:
-
The NSA is spying on every American, and
very deeply spying on us.
-
A surveillance system has been installed
inside of Facebook.
-
AT&T has been giving all of its Internet
traffic to the NSA since at least 2006.
-
Union thugs have no problem intercepting
emails.
-
Newspapers are having no problems
intercepting emails.
-
Stores are now installing face
recognition systems.
-
The FedGuv is paying big bucks for
systems to "predict crime."
-
The FBI is building a nation-wide facial
recognition system.
-
Biometric identification is being rolled
out in grammar schools.
The power elite likes to work with opposites.
Peace is war, prosperity is inflation, etc.
Nazi Germany has been pilloried in the West for 75 years. But it lives
through the reflective political regime that is now being put into place in
the US and eventually throughout the world.
It is the regime the power elite prefers because it maintains a pretense of
capitalism within a government that is highly adaptable to the mercantilist
control the power elite likes to exercise.
In other words, the elites shall run their neo-Nazi government behind the
scenes. The only real difference will be that Hitler ran it out front. We've
written about this National Socialist model here: Poison of Neo-National
Socialist Public Banking. So has economist Gary North.
The current power elite was behind the rise of National Socialism in
Germany. Swiss banks administered, sheltered and assisted in funding it. The
US Bush family had some of its assets seized over support of Nazi Germany.
In a 2010 article entitled
Cheerleader for Hitler's Economics, Gary North
persuasively laid out the modern parallels between the government fiat-money
crowd and pre-World War II boosterism for National Socialist economics.
He writes:
Ellen Brown is a lawyer by profession, a
Greenbacker by confession, and a fan of Adolf Hitler's economics by
consistency.
She is quite open about her support for National Socialism's economics,
as I shall demonstrate. What is depressing is this: she is getting a
respectful hearing in Tea Party circles. Her book, The Web of Debt
(2006), is widely cited on the World Wide Web.
As of early October, 2010, a Google search
for "Ellen Brown" and "Web of Debt" generated close to 600,000 hits.
This is huge.
Here is a tactical problem. For two generations, conservatives have been
shouted down by the Left with this accusation: "Fascist!" Ellen Brown is
now making this accusation plausible. Yet the great irony is this: Ellen
Brown is a Leftist.
There is nothing even remotely free market
or conservative about The Web of Debt.
It is a call for a Federally funded welfare
state.
She praises the New Deal. She praises John
Maynard Keynes. She has only one objection to their recommended
programs: governments borrowed money to fund them. She wants a welfare
state that is funded entirely by paper money printed by Congress.
She is about as conservative as Nancy
Pelosi.
It is this movement that RT seems to be covertly
supporting.
Were Gary North to write another article on the subject (he
wrote so many so well that Ms. Brown refuses to debate him anymore), he
might focus on how the power elite of the day was behind the rise of
National Socialist economics in the US.
Personally, I'm no expert on the 1930s but I believe I can see elite
handprints all over this modern-day revival.
For me, it is no coincidence that
George W. Bush named his most invasive, anti-freedom security
apparatus "Homeland Security" with its echoes of the "Fatherland."
The Nazi model with its emphasis on eugenics and
invasive state supervision of the private sector is the preferred model of
the coming world government.
It will not be built upon a platform of the
current regulatory democracy.
Nor will it be socialist.
Or communist.
Our overlords are planning global Nazism of the kind they first
installed and then destroyed in Germany.
They are nearly there, in my view. China's model is already a Nazi one.
Russia's, too, in many ways. The BRICs have similar models.
The EU has been compared to the USSR but Nazi Germany might be a better
model.
We write a lot about the "Internet Reformation."
My hope is that the free-flow of information will create a pushback that
will disallow the creation of a global Nazi regime.
I'm doing my part by writing this article.
Sure, maybe it will go down the memory hole. But one day people will
remember. Make no mistake. It was the power elite that helped fund Hitler,
just as the Internet has revealed to us that the West funded what became the
Soviet Union.
The intergenerational power elite always has preparatory runs. But I think
the future world government will be based on the Nazi model - if it gets
that far. I hope it won't.
The same great families are now re-erecting what they first built in Europe
75 years ago. Feel free to search "who
is the power elite" and you will undoubtedly find many suggestive
answers.
Let me add that it is truly difficult to write this editorial, as I enjoyed
the people I met working with RT, especially their international news
producer with whom I had regular contact. I have no doubt there are many
genuinely well-meaning individuals working for RT. As with any big media
organization, only the few at the top know the real agenda.
But I cannot sit by silently and not share my
opinion.
Come hell or high water we will continue to spell out what we see as gross
violations against individualism and humanity as a result of power elite
manipulations.
Help spread the word... Let people know we know. Let THEM know.
They are deathly afraid of the Internet Reformation - or should be.
It is our hope. And yours, too...
