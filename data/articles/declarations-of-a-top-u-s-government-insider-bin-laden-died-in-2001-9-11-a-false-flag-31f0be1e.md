Top US government insider Dr. Steve R. Pieczenik, a man who held
numerous different influential positions under three different Presidents
and still works with the Defense Department, shockingly told The Alex
Jones Show yesterday that
Osama
Bin Laden died in 2001 and that he was prepared to testify in
front of a grand jury how a top general told him directly that
9/11 was a false flag inside job.
Pieczenik cannot be dismissed as a conspiracy theorist.
He served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State under three different administrations, Nixon, Ford and Carter, while
also working under Reagan and Bush senior, and still works as a consultant
for the Department of Defense.
A former US Navy Captain, Pieczenik achieved
two prestigious Harry C. Solomon Awards at the Harvard Medical School as he
simultaneously completed a PhD at MIT.
Recruited by Lawrence Eagleburger as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
Management, Pieczenik went on to develop,
the basic tenets for
psychological warfare, counter terrorism, strategy and tactics for transcultural negotiations for the US State Department, military and
intelligence communities and other agencies of the US Government,
...while
also developing foundational strategies for hostage rescue that were later
employed around the world.
Pieczenik also served as a senior policy planner under Secretaries Henry
Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, George Schultz and James Baker and worked on George
W. Bushs election campaign against Al Gore.
His record underscores the fact
that he is one of the most deeply connected men in intelligence circles over
the past three decades plus.
The character of Jack Ryan, who appears in many Tom Clancy novels and was
also played by Harrison Ford in the popular 1992 movie Patriot Games, is
also based on Steve Pieczenik.
Back in April 2002, over nine years ago, Pieczenik told the Alex Jones Show
that Bin Laden had already been dead for months, and that the government
was waiting for the most politically expedient time to roll out his corpse.
Pieczenik would be in a position to know, having personally met Bin Laden
and worked with him during the proxy war against the Soviets in Afghanistan
back in the early 80â€²s.
Pieczenik said that Osama Bin Laden died in 2001,
Not because special
forces had killed him, but because as a physician I had known that the CIA
physicians had treated him and it was on the intelligence roster that he had
marfan syndrome, adding that the US government knew Bin Laden was dead
before they invaded Afghanistan.
Marfan syndrome is a degenerative genetic disease for which there is no
permanent cure.
The illness severely shortens the life span of
the sufferer.
He died of marfan syndrome,
Bush junior
knew about it, the intelligence community knew about it, said Pieczenik,
noting how CIA physicians had visited Bin Laden in July 2001 at the
American Hospital in Dubai.
He was already very sick from marfan syndrome and he was already dying,
so nobody had to kill him, added Pieczenik, stating that Bin Laden died
shortly after 9/11 in his Tora Bora cave complex.
Did the intelligence community or the CIA doctor up this situation, the
answer is yes, categorically yes, said Pieczenik, referring to Sundays
claim that Bin Laden was killed at his compound in Pakistan, adding,
This whole scenario where you see a bunch of people sitting there
looking at a screen and they look as if theyre intense, thats
nonsense, referring to the images released by the White House which
claim to show Biden, Obama and Hillary Clinton watching the operation to
kill Bin Laden live on a television screen (click below image.)
Its a total make-up, make believe, were in an American theater of the
absurd
why are we doing this again
nine years ago this man was already
dead
why does the government repeatedly have to lie to the American
people, asked Pieczenik.
Osama Bin Laden was totally dead, so theres no way they could have
attacked or confronted or killed Osama Bin laden, said Pieczenik,
joking that the only way it could have happened was if special forces
had attacked a mortuary.
Pieczenik said that the decision to launch the
hoax now was made because
Obama had reached a low with plummeting approval
ratings and the fact that the birther issue was blowing up in his face.
He had to prove that he was more than
American
he had to be aggressive, said Pieczenik, adding that the
farce was also a way of isolating Pakistan as a retaliation for intense
opposition to the Predator drone program, which has killed hundreds of
Pakistanis.
This is orchestrated, I mean when you have people sitting around and
watching a sitcom, basically the operations center of the White House,
and you have a president coming out almost zombie-like telling you they
just killed Osama Bin Laden who was already dead nine years ago, said
Pieczenik, calling the episode, the greatest falsehood Ive ever heard,
I mean it was absurd.
Dismissing the governments account of the
assassination of Bin Laden as a sick joke on the American people,
Pieczenik said,
They are so desperate to make Obama viable,
to negate the fact that he may
not have been born here, any questions
about his background, any irregularities about his background, to make
him look assertive
to re-elect this president so the American public
can be duped once again.
Pieczeniks assertion that Bin Laden died almost
ten years ago is
echoed by numerous intelligence professionals as well as
heads of state across the world.
Bin Laden,
Was used in the same way that 9/11 was used
to mobilize the emotions and feelings of the American people in order to
go to a war that had to be justified through a narrative that Bush
junior created and Cheney created about the world of terrorism, stated
Pieczenik.
During his interview with the Alex Jones Show
yesterday, Pieczenik also asserted he was directly told by a prominent
general that
9/11 was a stand down and a false flag operation, and that he
is prepared to go to a grand jury to reveal the generals name.
They ran the attacks, said Pieczenik,
naming,
-
Dick Cheney
-
Paul Wolfowitz
-
Stephen Hadley
-
Elliott Abrams
-
Condoleezza Rice,
...amongst others as having been directly involved.
It was called a stand down, a false flag operation in order to mobilize
the American public under false pretenses
it was told to me even by the
general on the staff of Wolfowitz - I will go in front of a federal
committee and swear on perjury who the name was of the individual so
that we can break it open, said Pieczenik, adding that he was furious
and knew it had happened.
I taught stand down and false flag operations at the national war
college, Ive taught it with all my operatives so I knew exactly what
was done to the American public, he added.
Pieczenik re-iterated that he was perfectly
willing to reveal the name of the general who told him 9/11 was an inside
job in a federal court,
so that we can unravel this thing legally,
not with the stupid 9/11 Commission that was absurd.
Pieczenik explained that he was not a liberal, a
conservative or a tea party member, merely an American who is deeply
concerned about the direction in which his country is heading.
