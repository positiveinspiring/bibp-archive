The manhunt for
the Boston Marathon bombing suspects
offered the nation a window into the stunning military-style capabilities of
our local law enforcement agencies.
For the past 30 years, police departments
throughout the United States have benefitted from the governments largesse
in the form of military weaponry and training, incentives offered in the
ongoing War
on Drugs.
For the average citizen watching events such as
the intense pursuit of the Tsarnaev brothers on television, it would
be difficult to discern between fully outfitted police SWAT teams and the
military.
The lines blurred even further Monday as a new dynamic was introduced to the
militarization of domestic law enforcement.
By making a few subtle changes to a regulation
in the U.S. Code titled Defense
Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies the military has
quietly granted itself the ability to police the streets without obtaining
prior local or state consent, upending a precedent that has been in place
for more than two centuries.

The most objectionable aspect of the regulatory change is the inclusion of
vague language that permits military intervention in the event of civil
disturbances.
According to the rule:
Federal military commanders have the
authority, in extraordinary emergency circumstances where prior
authorization by the President is impossible and duly constituted local
authorities are unable to control the situation, to engage temporarily
in activities that are necessary to quell large-scale, unexpected civil
disturbances.
Bruce Afran, a civil liberties attorney
and constitutional law professor at Rutgers University, calls the rule,
a wanton power grab by the military,
and says, Its quite shocking actually because it violates the
long-standing presumption that the military is under civilian control.
A defense official who declined to be named
takes a different view of the rule, claiming,
The authorization has been around over 100
years; its not a new authority. Its been there but it hasnt been
exercised. This is a carryover of domestic policy.
Moreover, he insists the Pentagon doesnt,
want to get involved in civilian law
enforcement. Its one of those red lines that the military hasnt signed
up for.
Nevertheless, he says,
every person in the military swears an oath
of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States to defend that
Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.
One of the more disturbing aspects of the new
procedures that govern military command on the ground in the event of a
civil disturbance relates to authority.
Not only does it fail to define what
circumstances would be so severe that the presidents authorization is
impossible, it grants full presidential authority to Federal military
commanders.
According to the defense official, a commander
is defined as follows:
Somebody whos in the position of command,
has the title commander. And most of the time they are centrally
selected by a board, theyve gone through additional schooling to
exercise command authority.
As it is written, this commander has the same
power to authorize military force as the president in the event the
president is somehow unable to access a telephone. (The rule doesnt address
the statutory chain of authority that already exists in the event a sitting
president is unavailable.)
In doing so, this commander must exercise
judgment in determining what constitutes, wanton destruction of property,
adequate protection for Federal property, domestic violence, or
conspiracy that hinders the execution of State or Federal law, as these
are the circumstances that might be considered an emergency.
These phrases dont have any legal
meaning, says Afran.
Its no different than the emergency powers
clause in the Weimar constitution [of the German Reich]. Its a grant of
emergency power to the military to rule over parts of the country at
their own discretion.
Afran also expresses apprehension over the
governments authority,
to engage temporarily in activities
necessary to quell large-scale disturbances.
Governments never like to give up power when they get it, says Afran.
They still think after twelve years they
can get intelligence out of people in Guantanamo. Temporary is in the
eye of the beholder. Thats why in statutes we have definitions. All of
these statutes have one thing in common and that is that they have no
definitions. How long is temporary? Theres none here. The definitions
are absurdly broad.
The U.S. military is prohibited from intervening
in domestic affairs except where provided under Article IV of the
Constitution in cases of domestic violence that threaten the government of a
state or the application of federal law. This provision was further
clarified both by the Insurrection Act of 1807 and a post-Reconstruction law
known as the
Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 (PCA).
The Insurrection Act specifies the circumstances
under which the president may convene the armed forces to suppress an
insurrection against any state or the federal government. Furthermore, where
an individual state is concerned, consent of the governor must be obtained
prior to the deployment of troops.
The PCA - passed in response to federal troops
that enforced local laws and oversaw elections during Reconstruction - made
unauthorized employment of federal troops a punishable offense, thereby
giving teeth to the Insurrection Act.
Together, these laws limit executive authority over domestic military
action. Yet Mondays official regulatory changes issued unilaterally by the
Department of Defense is a game-changer.
The stated purpose of the updated rule is support in Accordance With the
Posse Comitatus Act, but in reality it undermines the Insurrection Act and
PCA in significant and alarming ways.
The most substantial change is the notion of
civil disturbance as one of the few domestic emergencies that would
allow for the deployment of military assets on American soil.
To wit, the relatively few instances that federal troops have been deployed
for domestic support have produced a wide range of results. Situations have
included responding to natural disasters and protecting demonstrators during
the Civil Rights era to, disastrously, the Kent State student massacre and
the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee.
Michael German, senior policy counsel to the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), noted in a 2009
Daily Kos article that,
there is no doubt that the military is very
good at many things. But recent history shows that restraint in their
new-found domestic role is not one of them.
At the time German was referring to the
militarys expanded surveillance techniques and hostile interventions
related to border control and the War on Drugs.
And in fact, many have argued that these actions
have already upended the PCA in a significant way.
Even before this most recent rule change, the
ACLU was vocal in its opposition to the Department of Defense (DoD)
request to expand domestic military authority,
in the event of chemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear, or high yield explosive (CBRNE) incidents.
The ACLUs position is that civilian agencies
are more than equipped to handle such emergencies since 9/11. (ACLU
spokespersons in Washington D.C. declined, however, to be interviewed for
this story.)
But while outcomes of military interventions have varied, the protocol by
which the president works cooperatively with state governments has remained
the same. The president is only allowed to deploy troops to a state upon
request of its governor. Even then, the military - specifically the National
Guard - is there to provide support for local law enforcement and is
prohibited from engaging in any activities that are outside of this scope,
such as the power to arrest.
Eric Freedman, a constitutional law professor from Hofstra
University, also calls the ruling an unauthorized power grab.
According to Freedman,
The Department of Defense does not have the
authority to grant itself by regulation any more authority than Congress
has granted it by statute.
Yet thats precisely what it did.
This wasnt, however, the Pentagons first
attempt to expand its authority domestically in the last decade.
Déjà vu
During the
Bush Administration,
Congress passed the 2007 Defense Authorization Bill that included
language similar in scope to the current regulatory change.
It specifically amended the
Insurrection Act to expand the presidents
ability to deploy troops domestically under certain conditions including
health epidemics, natural disasters and terrorist activities, though it
stopped short of including civil disturbances.
But the following year this language was
repealed under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 via a bill
authored by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) who cited the
useful friction between the Insurrection and Posse Comitatus Acts in
limiting executive authority.
According to the DoD, the repeal of this language had more to do with
procedure and that it was never supposed to amend the Insurrection Act.
When it was actually passed, says the
defense official, Congress elected to amend the Insurrection Act and
put things in the Insurrection Act that were not insurrection, like the
support for disasters and emergencies and endemic influenza."
"Our intent, he says, was to give the
president and the secretary access to the reserve components. It
includes the National Guard and, rightfully so, the governors were
pretty upset because they were not consulted.
Senator Leahys office did not have a statement
as of press time, but a spokesperson said the senator had made an inquiry
with the DoD in response to our questions.
The defense official confirmed that he was
indeed being called in to discuss the senators concerns in a meeting
scheduled for today. But he downplayed any concern, saying,
Congress at any time can say we dont like
your interpretation of that law and how youve interpreted it in making
policy - and so they can call us to the Hill and ask us to justify why
were doing something.
Last year, Bruce Afran and another civil
liberties attorney Carl Mayer filed a lawsuit against the
Obama
Administration on behalf of a group of journalists and activists
lead by former New York Times journalist Chris Hedges.
They filed suit over the inclusion of a bill in
the NDAA 2012 that, according to the
plaintiffs, expanded executive authority over domestic affairs by
unilaterally granting the executive branch to indefinitely detain U.S.
citizens without due process.
The case has garnered international attention
and invited vigorous defense from the Obama Administration.
Even Afran goes so far as to say this current
rule change is,
another NDAA. Its even worse, to be
honest.
For Hedges and the other plaintiffs, including
Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, the
governments ever-expanding authority over civilian affairs has a chilling
effect on First Amendment activities such as free speech and the right to
assemble.
First District Court Judge Katherine Forrest
agreed with the plaintiffs and handed Hedges et al a resounding victory
prompting the Department of Justice to immediately file an injunction and an
appeal. The appellate court is expected to rule on the matter within the
next few months.
Another of the plaintiffs in the Hedges suit is Alexa OBrien, a
journalist and organizer who joined the lawsuit after she discovered a
Wikileaks cable showing government officials attempting to link her efforts
to terrorist activities.
For activists such as OBrien, the new DoD
regulatory change is frightening because it creates,
an environment of fear when people cannot
associate with one another. Like Afran and Freedman, she too calls the
move, another grab for power under the rubric of the war on terror, to
the detriment of citizens.
This is a complete erosion of the rule of law, says OBrien.
Knowing these sweeping powers were granted under
a rule change and not by Congress is even more harrowing to activists.
That anything can be made legal, says
OBrien, is fundamentally antithetical to good governance.
As far as what might qualify as a civil
disturbance, Afran notes,
In the Sixties all of the Vietnam protests
would meet this description. We saw Kent State. This would legalize Kent
State.
But the focus on the DoD regulatory change
obscures the creeping militarization that has already occurred in police
departments across the nation.
Even prior to the NDAA lawsuit, journalist
Chris Hedges was critical of domestic law enforcement agencies saying,
The widening use of militarized police
units effectively nullifies the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878.
This de facto nullification isnt lost on the
DoD.
The DoD official even referred to the Boston bombing suspects manhunt
saying,
Like most major police departments, if you
didnt know they were a police department you would think they were the
military.
According to this official there has purposely
been a,
large transfer of technology so that the
military doesnt have to get involved.
Moreover, he says the military has learned from
past events, such as the siege at Waco, where ATF officials mishandled
military equipment.
We have transferred the technology so we
dont have to loan it, he states.
But if the transfer of military training and
technology has been so thorough, it boggles the imagination as to what kind
of disturbance would be so overwhelming that it would require the suspension
of centuries-old law and precedent to grant military complete authority on
the ground.
The DoD official admits not being able to
envision that happening, adding,
but Im not a Hollywood screenwriter.
Afran, for one, isnt buying the logic.
For him, the distinction is simple.
Remember, the police operate under civilian
control, he says.
They are used to thinking in a civilian way
so the comparison that they may have some assault weapons doesnt change
this in any way. And they can be removed from power. You cant remove
the military from power.
Despite protestations from figures such as Afran
and OBrien and past admonitions from groups like the ACLU, for the first
time in our history the military has granted itself authority to quell a
civil disturbance.
Changing this rule now requires congressional or
judicial intervention.
This is where journalism comes in, says
Freedman. Calling attention to an unauthorized power grab in the hope
that it embarrasses the administration.
Afran is considering amending his NDAA complaint
currently in front of the court to include this regulatory change.
As we witnessed during the Boston bombing manhunt, its already difficult to
discern between military and police. In the future it might be impossible,
because there may be no difference.
