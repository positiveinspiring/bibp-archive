# Germans Stock Up on Weapons for Self-Defense

Germans, facing an influx of more
than one million asylum seekers from Africa, Asia and the Middle
East, are rushing to arm themselves.
All across Germany, a country with
some of the most stringent gun-control laws in Europe, demand is
skyrocketing for non-lethal self-defense weapons, including
pepper sprays, gas pistols, flare guns, electroshock weapons and
animal repellants.
Germans are also applying for weapons permits
in record numbers.
The scramble to acquire weapons
comes amid a migrant-driven
surge in violent crimes - including
rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults - in cities and
towns throughout the country.
German authorities, however, are
going to great lengths to argue that the German citizenry's
sudden interest in self-defense has nothing whatsoever to do
with mass migration into the country, despite ample evidence to
the contrary.
In recent weeks, German newspapers
have published dozens of stories with headlines such as:
Since Germany's
migration crisis
exploded in August 2015, nationwide sales of pepper spray have
jumped by 600%,
according to the German newsmagazine,
Focus.
Supplies of the product are now
completely sold out in many parts of the country and additional
stocks will not become available until 2016.
"Manufacturers and distributors
say the huge influx of foreigners in recent weeks has
apparently frightened many people," Focus reports.
According to KH Security, a German
manufacturer of self-defense products,
demand is up by a factor of five, and sales in September
2015 - the month when the implications of German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's open-door migration policy began to dawn on
many Germans - were the highest since the company was founded 25
years ago.
The company says there is an
increased demand not only for self-defense weapons, but also for
home alarm systems.
Another manufacturer of self-defense
products, the Frankfurt-based company DEF-TEC Defense
Technology, has
reported a 600% increase in sales this fall.
According to CEO Kai Prase:
"Things took off beginning in
September. Since then, our dealers have been totally
overrun. We have never experienced anything like this in the
21 years of our corporate history.
Fear: This is not rational.
The important term is: 'refugee
crisis.'"
The same story is being repeated
across Germany.
According to the public broadcaster,
Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, citizens in Saxony can regularly be
seen
queuing up in large numbers waiting for gun shops to open.
A store owner in the Saxon town of
Pirna said he is now selling up to 200 cans of pepper spray each
day, compared to five cans a week before the migrant crisis
began.
He said he is seeing many new
customers who are not the typical clientele, including women of
all ages and men who are buying weapons for their wives.
Günter Fritz, the owner of a
gun shop in Ebersbach, another town in Saxony,
told RTL News,
"Since September, all over
Germany, also at my shop, sales of self-defense products
have exploded."
He added that his clients come from
all walks of life, ranging,
"from the professor to the
retired lady. All are afraid."
Andreas Reinhardt, a gun shop
owner in the northern German town of Eutin,
said he now sells four to five self-defense weapons each
day, compared to around two per month before the recent influx
of asylum seekers.
"The current social upheaval is
clearly driving the current rush to self-defense," he said.
"I never thought that fear would spread so quickly," he
added.
Eric Thiel, the owner of a
gun shop in Flensburg, a city on the Baltic Sea coast,
said that pepper spray is no longer available:
"Everything is sold out. New
supplies will not arrive until March. Everything that has to
do with self-defense is booming enormously."
Wolfgang Mayer, the owner of
a gun shop in Nördlingen, a town in Bavaria,
said he has an explanation for the surge in gun licenses:
"I think with the influx of
refugees, the rise in break-ins and the many tricksters, the
people are demanding greater protection."
Mayer added that there is a growing
sense within German society that the state cannot adequately
protect its citizens and therefore they have to better protect
themselves.
"Since the summer, sales of
pepper spray have increased by 50%," Mayer said, adding that
buyers are mainly women, of all ages - from the student in
the city up to the widowed grandmother.
Pepper spray and other types of
non-lethal self-defense weapons are legal in Germany, but a
permit is required to carry and use some categories of them.
Officials in all of Germany's 16 federal states are reporting a
spike in applications for such permits, known as the small
weapons license (kleinen Waffenschein).
In the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, nearly 10,000 people now hold a small
weapons license, an "all-time record level,"
according to the regional interior ministry.
Retailers in the state are also
reporting an "unprecedented surge" in sales of self-defense
weapons, with supplies of pepper spray sold out until the spring
of 2016.
In Saxony, retailers are
reporting an unprecedented boom in sales of pepper spray,
tear gas, gas pistols and even cross bows. Some stores are now
selling more self-defense weapons in one day than they did in an
entire month before the migrant crisis began.
Saxon officials are also
reporting a jump in the number of people applying for the
full-fledged firearms license (großen Waffenschein).
The rush to arms can be attributed
to a,
"subjective decline in the
people's sense of security," Saxon Interior Minister Markus
Ulbig said.
In Berlin, the number of
people holding a small weapons license increased by 30% during
the first ten months of 2015 compared to the same period in
2014, while the number of those holding the full-fledged
firearms license jumped by some 50%,
according to local police.
In Bavaria, more than 45,000
people now hold a small weapons license, 3,000 more than in
2014.
This represents a "significant
increase,"
according to the regional interior ministry. As in other
parts of Germany, Bavarian retailers are also reporting a boom
in sales of self-defense weapons, including gas pistols, flare
guns and pepper spray.
In Stuttgart, the capital city of
Baden-Württemberg, local gun shops are
reporting a four-fold increase in sales of self-defense
weapons since August. One shop owner said she now sells more
weapons in one week than she normally sells in one month.
She added that she has never seen
such high demand.
In Heilbronn, another city in
Baden-Württemberg, local officials
report that sales of pepper spray have doubled in 2015.
According to one shopkeeper, the
demand for pepper spray began surging in August, when many
mothers started purchasing the product for their school-aged
daughters.
"Our clients are extremely
afraid," the shopkeeper
said. "We are seeing this everywhere."
In Gera, a city in Thuringia,
local media
reported that at one store, the entire inventory of 120 cans
of pepper spray was sold out within three hours. The store,
which subsequently sold out of another batch of 144 cans, is now
on a waiting list to obtain more because of supplier shortfalls.
A woman in Gera who bought pepper
spray for her 16-year-old daughter
said:
"I think it is fundamentally
proper for me to protect my daughter.
She is at that age where she is
out alone in the evening. If she says she needs this for
protection, I think this is not unjustified. Of course, due
to the current situation that we now have in Germany. We
just do not know who is here.
There are quite a lot of people
who are not registered."
The same trend toward self-defense
is being repeated in the German states of,
...where spiraling levels of violent
crime perpetrated by migrants is turning some neighborhoods into
no-go zones.
Apologists for mass migration are
accusing German citizens of overreacting. Some
point
to recent studies - commissioned by pro-migration groups - which
claim, implausibly, that the number of crimes committed by
migrants is decreasing, not increasing.
Others
deny that the rush to self-defense has anything to do with
migrants at all.
They blame a variety of different
factors, including the early darkness associated with the end of
daylight savings time, the jihadist attacks in Paris (which
occurred in November, three months after sales of self-defense
weapons began to spike), and the need for protection from wild
wolves in parts of northern Germany.
The Süddeutsche Zeitung
described the deception this way:
"Anyone who asks for the reasons
for the surge in weapons purchases encounters silence.
Officially, the regulatory
agencies say that anyone who applies for the small weapons
license does not need to provide a justification and
therefore the government offices have no explanation.
'But it is true that
sometimes we clearly get the message that they are
afraid because of the refugees,' says one, on condition
that his name and office will not be mentioned in the
newspaper.
'People have already told me: I want to
protect my family.'
We have reported this to the
Ministry...
"The retailers also say nothing
officially about the reasons for the increase in sales. Call
a small gun shop. Many refugees arrived at the end of
August, and since September the numbers are up, can there
not be a connection?
'If you do not use my name:
Sure, what else?' says the man on the phone.
The people who come to the store
are afraid.
They believe that among the refugees there are
'black sheep.' Some customers openly admit it."
Empirical evidence shows an
indisputable nationwide
spike in migrant-driven crime, including
rapes of German women and girls on a shocking scale, as well
as sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions,
robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking.
The spike in violent crimes
committed by migrants has been corroborated by a confidential
police report leaked to a German newspaper.
The document
reveals
that a record-breaking 38,000 asylum seekers were accused of
committing crimes in the country in 2014. Analysts believe this
figure - which works out to more than 100 crimes a day - is only
a fragment: many crimes are not reported.
Not surprisingly, a new poll
shows that 55% of Germans are pessimistic about the future,
up from 31% in 2014 and 28% in 2013.
The poll shows that 42% of
those between the ages of 14 and 34 believe their future will be
bleak; this is more than double the number of those (19%) who
felt this way in 2013.
At the same time, 64% of those aged 55
and above are fearful about the future.
The poll also shows that four-fifths
(79%) of the German population believe the economy will
deteriorate in 2016 due to the financial burdens created by the
migration crisis, and 70% believe that member states of the
European Union will drift further apart in the coming year.
The most predictable finding of all:
87% of Germans believe their politicians will experience a
decline in public support during 2016...
