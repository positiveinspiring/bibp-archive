As long-planned sectarian
bloodbath unfolds,
UN deceitfully labels atrocities as
"reprisals."
As early as 2007,
it was reported that the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, together were not
only organizing, funding, training, and arming militants directly linked to
Al Qaeda to be used against Syria and Iran, but knew well in advance that by
doing so, they would trigger an unprecedented "cataclysmic conflict" driven
by sectarian extremism.
Not only was such sectarian violence expected, it
was desired ahead of redrawing a new map for the Middle East - one that
favored Western corporate-financier and geopolitical interests, while
keeping the region weak, divided, and infighting.
Now, the UN is feigning indignation over the inevitable, increasingly overt
sectarian nature of the so-called "Free Syrian Army" and its so-called
"rebellion." Entire communities of minorities face extermination.
To blunt
the impact this will have on public opinion, UN
special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Adama Dieng has preemptively
stated:
"I am deeply
concerned that entire communities risk paying the price for crimes
committed by the Syrian government."
According to
Reuters' article, "U.N.
anti-genocide envoy: Syria minorities face reprisal risk," the genocide
NATO and its allies are arming, funding, and willfully fueling is merely
"reprisals."
What Reuters doesn't report is that US, Saudi, and Lebanese
officials had for years warned that US foreign policy, started under Bush
and continued in earnest under Obama, would trigger this very sort of
sectarian violence - driven by Al Qaeda-style fanaticism, not "reprisals."
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh writing for the New Yorker,
wrote in his 2007 article, "The
Redirection - Is the Administrations new policy benefitting our enemies in
the war on terrorism?" that:
"To undermine Iran, which is predominantly
Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure
its priorities in the Middle East.
In Lebanon, the Administration has
cooperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in
clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite
organization that is backed by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in
clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of
these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that
espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and
sympathetic to Al Qaeda."
Hersh's report would continue by stating:
"the Saudi government, with Washingtons
approval, would provide funds and logistical aid to weaken the
government of President Bashir Assad, of Syria.
The Israelis believe
that putting such pressure on the Assad government will make it more
conciliatory and open to negotiations."

Seymour Hersh (2007)
Further admissions of a joint US-Israeli-Saudi
conspiracy against Syria included:
"...[Saudi Arabia's] Bandar and other Saudis
have assured the White House that,
they will keep a very close eye on
the religious fundamentalists. Their message to us was Weve created
this movement, and we can control it. Its not that we dont want the Salafis to throw bombs; its
who they throw them at - Hezbollah, Moqtada al-Sadr, Iran, and at the Syrians, if they continue to work with
Hezbollah and Iran.
The Redirection,
Seymour Hersh (2007)
In regards to
sectarian extremism in particular it was forewarned that:
Robert Baer, a former longtime CIA
agent in Lebanon, has been a severe critic of Hezbollah and has warned
of its links to Iranian-sponsored terrorism.
But now, he told me,
weve
got Sunni Arabs preparing for cataclysmic conflict, and we will need
somebody to protect the Christians in Lebanon. It used to be the French
and the United States who would do it, and now its going to be Nasrallah and the Shiites"
The Redirection,
Seymour Hersh (2007)
Hezbollah's leader,
Hassan Nasrallah was also featured in Hersh's
report and had also warned of imminent and spreading sectarian war
purposefully stoked by the West:
Nasrallah said he believed that President
Bushs goal was the drawing of a new map for the region. They want the
partition of Iraq. Iraq is not on the edge of a civil war - there is
a civil war. There is ethnic and sectarian cleansing.
The daily killing
and displacement which is taking place in Iraq aims at achieving three
Iraqi parts, which will be sectarian and ethnically pure as a prelude to
the partition of Iraq. Within one or two years at the most, there will
be total Sunni areas, total Shiite areas, and total Kurdish areas.
Even
in Baghdad, there is a fear that it might be divided into two areas, one
Sunni and one Shiite.
He went on,
I can say that President Bush is lying when he says he does
not want Iraq to be partitioned. All the facts occurring now on the
ground make you swear he is dragging Iraq to partition. And a day will
come when he will say, I cannot do anything, since the Iraqis want the
partition of their country and I honor the wishes of the people of
Iraq.
Nasrallah said he believed that America also wanted to bring about the
partition of Lebanon and of Syria. In Syria, he said, the result would
be to push the country into chaos and internal battles like in Iraq.
In Lebanon,
There will be a Sunni state, an Alawi state, a Christian
state, and a Druze state. But, he said, I do not know if there will be
a Shiite state.
The UN once again
is abusing its own self-appointed authority by excusing and spinning
premeditated sectarian genocide designed to advance a documented conspiracy
admitted to years ago.
More recently, this conspiracy to destroy Syria
through engineered and purposefully protracted violence was documented
further by the very corporate-financiers themselves amongst the pages of
reports turned out by their own policy think-tanks.
The Brookings Institution in their "Middle
East Memo #21 - Saving Syria: Assessing Options for Regime Change," openly stated they sought to "bleed" Syria in purposefully
protracted violence:
"The United States might still arm the
opposition even knowing they will probably never have sufficient power,
on their own, to dislodge the Asad network.
Washington might choose to
do so simply in the belief that at least providing an oppressed people
with some ability to resist their oppressors is better than doing
nothing at all, even if the support provided has little chance of
turning defeat into victory.
Alternatively, the United States might
calculate that it is still worthwhile to pin down the Asad regime and
bleed it, keeping a regional adversary weak, while avoiding the costs of
direct intervention."

8-9, Assessing Options for Regime Change, Brookings Institution.
Such documents completely contradict the public
statements issued by the West, which attempt to portray their involvement in
Syria as motivated by "humanitarian concerns," "moral imperatives," and the
"promotion of democracy."
In reality, the goal is to prolong the violence as
long as possible, expedite the loss of life, and to destroy the nation by
fueling violent militants - just as it was the plan in 2007 when Hersh
penned "The Redirection."
The sectarian component of the current conflict is
not an unexpected result of violence that began only in 2011, it was an
integral part of the West's foreign policy since 2007.
The sectarian genocide in Syria was purposefully engineered by Western
policy makers, and now is willfully covered up, spun, and excused by the UN
and the Western mass media alike.
