Auroville, India Early in May of this year, a courageous mother, Mrs. Lois
Godfrey of Garden Grove, California, succeeded in getting
sensitivity
training outlawed, at least temporarily, in the Garden Grove Unified School
District.
Mrs. Godfrey withdrew two of her children from a class in which
the process was being used, then appeared before the school board where she
was challenged
to give a definition of
sensitivity training, which she gave,
having received it from me through State Senator John G. Schmitz.
The definition:
"Sensitivity training is defined as group
meetings, large or small, to discuss publicly intimate and personal
matters, and opinions, values or beliefs; and/or, to act out emotions
and feelings toward one another in the group, using techniques of
self-confession and mutual criticism.
It is also, 'coercive persuasion in the form of thought reform or
brainwashing.' "
The second paragraph, admitting that sensitivity
(human relations) training is brainwashing, is from page 47 of
Issue In
Training, a manual for group leaders published in 1962 by the
National
Training Laboratories (NTL) of the
National Education Association (NEA).
That is, from the main source of sensitivity training, from the "horse's
mouth!"
Many people tell me that, in saying this comes from the horse's mouth, I
miss the target by the length of exactly one horse.
I'm forced to agree with them.
For what we are talking about is communist group criticism, a destructive
process that is used in every communist country every day to control the
people, to force their thinking into the "correct" patterns; and to make
sure that each person acts as the fearful and submissive member of a group,
a "collective."
Edward Hunter, in his book
Brainwashing - From Pavlov to Powers (1965), calls group criticism,
"The greatest threat against our society - the
calculated creation of a national neurosis." Then he goes on: "The only Red
defense has been to hush up the subject, because even to deny it would bring
attention to it."
Pressure Has Increased
Realizing this makes it easy to understand why, since my expose in
"Communism in Our Midst," American Mercury, Summer 1967, followed by "Hate
Therapy," by Gary Allen, American Opinion, January 1968, the pressure and
pace of the sensitivity assault have increased - with "voluntary"
participation increasingly replaced by the frankly brutal insistence that
sensitivity training be mandatory.
The outlawing of sensitivity training at Garden Grove has given added force
to that reaction.
For it was at Garden Grove on February 26, 1969, that
2,000 teachers were forced to attend a seminar where psychologist Jack Frymer, of Ohio State
University, told them that,
"They should go to
sensitivity training sessions in order to know how to use ST on their
pupils."
Already an attempt is being made to sneak the process back again
under the name "Evaluation," or another program called "Social Sciences
Framework." School Superintendent David Paynter has suddenly decided that
"sensitivity training cannot be defined,"! and the battle rages on.
Carl Rogers, Ph.D., of the
Western Behavioral Sciences Lab, and
one of the chief pushers of ST, was so shaken that when he spoke at Cerritos
College teat Long Beach on May 6, he refused to answer questions, stating,
"I do not know the audience."
Main Attack
But the main attack comes on a much broader front:
-
Recently California Senate Bill (SB) 1414 set a pattern for repressive
legislation in every state, providing, in its "Poverty" provisions, Section
I, for inservice sensitivity training for all teachers under threat of
losing tenure (their jobs) if they do not submit.
-
In June, Robert Finch, of Health, Education & Welfare, announced plans
for a national network (note word "network"), of "experimental and
demonstrations schools dedicated to the innovative process." Translation:
Sensitivity training for planned change.
-
Again in California, that testing lab for "social engineering," SB 474
was introduced in June by Senator Beilenson (D), the same legislator who
originated a bill in favor of abortion. No. 474 would allow group leaders in
ST or Human Relations training to be licensed by the State, "to make sure
they are qualified." This completely ignores the fact that, whether the
group leaders are qualified or not, no one has any business forcing healthy
people to take sensitivity training, "a perversion of group therapy that
makes healthy minds sick!"
-
To increase the pressure even more, The California Elementary School
Administrators Association (CESAA), now promotes legal contracts with
organizations teaching ST, such as the
Far West Laboratory. These
contracts are made with school boards not alert to what they are signing,
"To evaluate curriculum, stressing human potential and development of the
child." Again sensitivity training.
But the deadliest thrust is nationwide:
-
The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE), a
department of the NEA, now reaches into every state to force both teachers
and teacher-candidates to accept ST for national accreditization. That is,
an interstate teaching compact is being set up to enforce nation-wide
standards of "teacher understanding," plus disciplinary moves against
teachers or candidates who protest!
National Education Association
On September 23, 1968, the then President of
the NEA, Elizabeth D. Koontz,
got into the AACTE at a meeting of the association in New York.
Said she:
"The NEA has a multi-faceted program already directed toward the urban
school problem, embracing every phase, from the Headstart Program to
sensitivity training for adults - both teachers and parents."
Thus she revealed the real goal: involvement of the entire community in one
gigantic laboratory of groups, exactly as in North Vietnam, Russia and Red
China.
It is enlightening to know that this same Elizabeth Koontz, the first Negro
president of the NEA and a known member of the board of
SIECUS, the infamous
"Sex Information & Education Council of the U.S.," was appointed by
President Nixon, earlier this year, Director of the Womens' Bureau of the
Department of Labor!
Synchronized with this attack by what, we must remember, is "coercive
persuasion or brainwashing," was the announcement last February by New York
University that it now offers a master's degree in sensitivity training;
followed by Redlands University in California with its trumpet blast in May
that it, too, starts ST this summer - and that it will be mandatory!
Thus a class of group trainers or "social facilitators" is coming into
existence to "facilitate" the understanding and "correct thinking"
of you
and your children.
For the same thing is happening, sparked by AACTE of the
NEA, at nearly every college and university in the United States, including
any private or parochial school that is foolish enough to accept either
Federal funds or a Ford grant.
Nixon Invited
It is somehow fitting and just, in view of President Nixon's appointment of
Mrs. Koontz, that in Look magazine, June 10, 1969, Nixon himself, along with
his entire staff, was invited to attend sensitivity training "in a series of
interracial confrontations."!
Who invited him?
None other than Ralph D.
Abernathy, of the Communist Southern "Christian" Leadership Conference, left
hand man of the late Martin Luther King.
Although this information tells us very much, it is still necessary to ask
where the force comes from that can react to the gradual awakening of the
American people, to the dangers of sensitivity training, with such
coordination and power.
What is the source, the origin, the Eye of the
Octopus?
State Advisory Committee
A special advisory committee to the State Board of Education in California
hinted strongly at this source on May 9, 1969.
Staffed by such courageous
conservatives as Dr. Edward Klotz, former Special Assistant to the Board of
Education, and Professor Harden B. Jones, of Berkeley (who made an extensive
study of the Nazi use of ST in Hitler's Germany), the committee concluded
that:
"Sensitivity training is being used by those who are in fact aligned with
revolutionary groups acting contrary to public policy; that is, they intend
to use the schools to destroy American culture and traditions."
The path to the Eye of the Octopus, where the destruction originates,
extends much further than I at first supposed in 1967. But complicated
though the path may seem, and cancerous in its meanderings, it is actually
simple, in the way that an avalanche or a raging forest fire may be said to
be simple.
Before we take that path it is essential to understand two things:
-
The "far-out" methods of
sensitivity training that have received so much
publicity, such as the nude marathons, the body awareness, the intimate
contacts and sexual permissiveness, are not allowed in communist countries.
These types are only used on countries targeted to be softened and
undermined for subversion and conquest.
-
Sensitivity training, according to Melvin Anchell, M.D. of Los Angeles,
is clinically desensitization and should be called "Insensitivity training."
With that as a foundation we can proceed without illusion, seeing our
subject steady and clear, knowing it not only for what it is - but what it
is not.
The Great Deceit (Veritas Foundation Staff Study: 1964), referring to the
American socialist and one-worlder,
E.A. Ross and his book
Social Control
(1901), points out that:
"The main interest of leftist socialists is to construct processes which are
now lumped together under the popular term 'brainwashing' as a means of
conditioning and indoctrinating the mind of man."
And further:
"The left-wingers have as their aim the seizing of all society. This
includes not only all the wealth and political power, but also control,
through conditioning and manipulation, of the mind and spirit of all
mankind."
It should therefore come as no shock, to those who study the
One-World
Movement, to learn that the earliest One-World organization,
The Order of
the Illuminati, used sensitivity training.*
* Seventeen Eighty-Nine, American Opinion Review Series: 1968 PP. 85-86;
More Stately Mansions, Robert Welch: 1964 P. 16, Item #8
[N.B.: in particular, see E. Michael Jones'
Libido Dominandi: Sexual
Liberation and Political Control, pp. 124-130, for the similarities between
the confessional/self-analysis of the Illuminati (Seelenspionage;
Seelenanalyse) and the psychoanalysis of Freud. - T.M.]
The Illuminati
Founded in Bavaria on May 1, 1776, by the brilliant but degenerate
Adam Weishaupt, the Illuminati (Enlightened Ones) played a major role in the
French Revolution, before going underground in 1795 and emerging, partially,
in 1848 as the League of the Just, which hired Karl Marx to write the
Communist Manifesto.
[N.B.: "major role" in the French Revolution, is an overstatement; 1793/94
is the date in which the Illuminati had gone completely underground (with
the death of its second "General," Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, on
December 13, 1793). That the League of the Just was, at the time, the latest
incarnation of the original Illuminati, is a theory only; however,
ideological continuity between the two - originating ultimately, from the
teachings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau - is certainly apparent. - T.M.]
Sensitivity training, as it turns out, is the most poisonous legacy the
Illuminati left us - and the main evidence we have that the Illuminati, as a
part of the overall conspiracy, are very much with us today, not only in the
United States, but throughout the world.
Before we probe further for the Eye of the Octopus, a brief recap is
necessary.
We already know the following:
That the self-criticism of the Illuminati was revived in 1929 by the Soviet
Secret Police for use on Russian citizens; while under the name of
"sensitivity training" it was started in the U.S. with the founding of the
National Training Laboratories of the NEA in 1946.
That in October, 1945, a Leftist Canadian psychiatrist,
G.
Brock Chisholm
(image right), gave three lectures in Washington, D.C. which laid the
foundations for both the "sex education" that is causing so much trouble
today and sensitivity training.
Now Chisholm was invited to give these lectures by
Alger Hiss and was warmly
applauded by a Washington lawyer, Abe Fortas. It is easy to see why Fortas
liked the lectures.
Not only did Chisholm advocate doing away with the "ways of the elders," by
force if need be, but also insisted we must do away with the "concept of
right and wrong;" start sex education in the 4th, 5th, and 6th grades;
fumigate "Mom and Dad" psychologically with self analysis, ST, that is; all
with one race, one common humanity, as the goal in a One-World Government.
This, of course, but scratches the surface of the Chisholm world
improvements; but we now know that a member of Chisholm's staff when
Chisholm was Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), was Dr.
Frank Calderone, husband of Mary Calderone of SIECUS fame. We are consequently not
surprised again to learn that the "sex ed" of the kind now being pushed is
sensitivity training and that's what is wrong with it!
All the ingredients
are there: self-confession, the lack of right and wrong, group consensus,
the "New Morality," and the only loyalty that toward One-World, as condensed
in the World Citizenship Credo of the United Nations: "World Citizenship and
Mental Health."
Get it? If you are so blind as not to perceive the blessings of One-World,
you are less than healthy and
ready for shock treatments.
In 1951 UNESCO, "United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural
Organization," brought the chain of power behind sensitivity training to a
focus by imposing the UNESCO doctrine of "Social Health" on the United
States. This was done through the U.N. Joint Commission of Mental Health, of
which "our" National Education Association, with its National Training
Laboratories, is a member.
What is the UNESCO doctrine of social health? Belief in One-World Government.
In that year 1951 the National Association for Mental Health, part of
Health, Education & Welfare, and subordinate to UNESCO and WHO, announced:
"The principles of mental health cannot be successfully furthered unless
there is acceptance or the concept of world government."
And then:
"Our chief problem is... how individual and group resistance to change
can be overcome."
Or do you prefer, "We shall overcome?"
As the late Congressman Usher L. Burdick put it:
"To bring this country into line to accept world government, many things
must be done by the U.N. and her agencies, such as UNESCO. First of all,
love of country is found by these conspirators to be very deep and hard to
destroy. Here UNESCO comes into play, to teach these children, with
specially trained teachers, that love of country interferes, with loyalty to
a world organization, that they must transfer their loyalty to a world
organization."
The "specially trained teachers" now come, in a steady stream, from the many
teachers' colleges where sensitivity training is mandatory.
The American Legion, Department of California, declared, July 1, 1962:
"The international cartelist structure, through which the collateral
descendants of 18th Century Illuminists control the U.S. Government and its
people today, is represented by the subversive
Council on Foreign
Relations."
Of course.
Anyone who has read Gary Allen's article on the C.F.R.* is aware of the
interlocking directorates, memberships and influences that make the world
conspiracy what
Hilaire du Berrier has aptly called, "A Basket of Eels."
* "The C.F.R Conspiracy to Rule the World," American Opinion: April 1969.
The Eye of this particular Octopus, then, is
UNESCO.
But something is missing.
The other eye.
For that trail we go to
The Esalen Institute between the Pacific and the
pines of Big Sur. The only note of optimism I have is that Esalen is named
after an extinct Indian tribe.
From now on, hold tight.
Abraham M. Maslow, Ph.D., President of the leftist
American Psychological
Association, on the staffs of both Brandeis University and Esalen, has
called Esalen,
"Potentially the most important educational institution in
the world."
He ought to know.
For although this strange collective of huts, halls, and swimming pool has
only been active since 1964, it has "serviced" more than 150,000 of the
curious, the weak, and the sinister, in search of their "human potential,"
including teachers from the CTA:
California Teachers Associations.
The chief characteristic of Esalen, once you get past the first shock of the
obvious degeneracy, is the unmistakable evidence of widespread overlapping
and cross-fertilization.
The National Training Labs are very much involved
in Esalen; and Carl Rogers, advisor to Esalen and member of the Western
Behavioral Sciences Institute at La Jolla, California, admits that, "all
groups start from the NTL."
Not only does Esalen have a weekly program over San Francisco station KQED,
but the staff and advisors includes psychiatrist Frederick Perls, developer
of
gestalt therapy, "a hostile personality," according to a woman who
questioned him once about the value of sensitivity training.
Then, of course, there is
S.I. Hayakawa, now permanent president of
San
Francisco State College, a staunch advocate of sensitivity training an
advisor to Esalen.
There is also
William Schutz, Ph.D., who, when I debated him on the
Joe
Dolan Show in Oakland last February, gave me the opportunity to point out to
the audience, not only that the Nazis used sensitivity training in their
"Strength Through Joy" movement, but that Schutz, by the sheerest
coincidence, is the author of a book on ST whose title is
JOY.
But I grow lyrical and, while that's easy to do with Esalen, it's not proper
when dealing with an octopus.
We have seen that all groups start with the NTL and that the NTL-NEA combine
is prominent at Esalen.
European Network
Now let's shift our focus from Esalen to the NTL and its double headquarters
at
Bethel, Maine; and Washington, D.C. (1201 16th St., N.W.).
We find that a
web of NTL programs is being conducted in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Nigeria,
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands,
Japan, West Germany, Australia and New Zealand!
This European network extends from England
and the
Tavistock Institute,
University of Leicester, to the Institute of
Social Research, University of Vienna, Austria; The Technological Institute
in Denmark; and the
Netherlands Pedagogical Institute at Zeist.
In Germany, The German Productivity Center; in Sweden, the State
Technological Institute; and from there, always under NTL control, the
network spreads to six centers in France, foremost of which is the Social
Psychology Laboratory of the Sorbonne (scene of the leftists riots, May,
1968), and the National Association for the Development of Humane Sciences,
at the Universities of Bordeaux and Strasbourg.
It is instructive to know that, in September, 1969, sex "Family Life"
education started in the schools of West Germany.
India and Pakistan
Tempting as it is to take a closer look at this sub-network in Europe, the
NTL programs on the other side of the world, in Pakistan and Socialist
India, demand our attention.
For several years Pakistan, split into East and West by Northern India, was
"beneficiary" of sensitivity training from the NTL trained School of Public
Administration, UCLA, before the communist-led riots tore that divided
country even more apart last year. The smug report of liberal Associate
Professor Robert Abramson: Techniques of Sensitivity (Human Relations)
Training and Their Application in Pakistan (UCLA: 1967), makes it only too
clear what an impact ST had on that unhappy land.
India and Pakistan. Have we hit on something?
Consider this. Michael Murphy, owner of Esalen, is an unusual character.
Just being the brother of Dennis Murphy, author of The Sergeant, now a movie
about a homosexual sergeant in, of course, the U.S. Army, makes him unique
enough.
But in 1948-'49
Michael Murphy studied in India at a place called
Auroville.
Auroville is on the east Coromandel coast of the Bay of Bengal, just outside
the former French city of Pondicherry.
As coincidence would have it, young Mike studied collectivist doctrine under
a "guru" who in reality was an old Marxist revolutionary named
Sri Aurobindo.
The gentle Aurobindo was a Cambridge graduate born in 1872
and had once in
1908, been jailed by the British for a very ungentle bomb plot.
He died in 1950, but not before indoctrinating Murphy in what he must do, as
well as laying plans for a much larger Auroville and Ashram or Growth
Center. Aurobindo's wife, now 92 and known as "The Mother," became and
remains titular head of Auroville, "the Planetary City."
Murphy returned to the U.S. and, almost literally, went into a cocoon, while
the world changed and Western civilizations, as we know it, became hell-bent
for suicide. Then, in 1964, Esalen sprang into being on Murphy's land in Big
Sur, midway between Hearst Castle and Monterey.
Miraculously, it was
revealed that the Growth Center of Auroville in India was ready to grow.
Just as miraculously, or so it seemed, the Growth Center of Esalen was
joined by other "Ashrams for human potential" throughout the U.S. and
Canada:
-
Adanta, Inc. - Atlanta, Georgia
-
Admare - Bowling Green, Ohio
-
Berkeley Center for Human Interaction - Berkeley, Calif.
-
Boston Tea Party House - Boston, Mass.
-
Bucks County Seminar House - Erwinna, Pa.
-
Cambridge House - Milwaukee, Wisconsin
-
Casaelya - San Francisco, Calif.
-
Evergreen Institute - Littleton, Colorado
-
Gestalt Therapy Institute - Cleveland Heights, Ohio
-
Human Resources Development - Hidden Springs, New Hampshire
-
Kopavi, Inc. - St. Paul, Minn.
-
Laos House - Austin, Texas
-
Oasis (Midwest Center for Human Potential) - Chicago, Ill.
-
Ontos - West Chicago, Ill.
-
Orizon - Washington, D.C .
-
Plainfield - Plainfield, New Jersey
-
Shalal - Vancouver, Canada
-
Synergia - Montreal, Canada
-
Sky Farm Institute - Calais, Vermont
-
San Francisco Gestalt Therapy Institute - San Francisco, Calif.
-
Shadybrook House - Mentor, Ohio
-
Tarry Town House - Tarryton, New York
-
Wainwright House - Rye, New York
And miracle of miracles, the growth of the "awareness" centers multiplied,
as though from the splitting of an amoeba, into something called
"Intentional Communities," 69 of them, all the way from The Children of
Light Commune in Gila Bend, Arizona, to Magic Mountain (Spartacist),
Seattle, Washington; and many others in Canada, Japan, Central America,
France, New Zealand, even Israel.
Do you suppose we should take another look at Auroville?
The first thing we notice is that the Auroville center has indeed had a
tremendous growth since the death of its founder 19 years ago, and that it
is now a small city with an expected population for the near future of
50,000 from all walks of life and all countries, all believers in,
-
one-world
-
one race
-
one government
The second thing to notice is that Auroville receives, and has received for
years, the hard
financial support of that first Eye of the Octopus, UNESCO.
It is this hard cash that has encouraged French architect, Roger Anger, to
develop,
"concrete plans for Auroville to be a
model city for the whole
planet."
Equals One
But even before you digest that, be advised that Auroville publishes a
magazine with the strange, but revealing title of Equals One.
The "magazine"
is actually an esoteric pink package of arty booklets, obviously to appeal
to the idealistic novice worker for One-World Brotherhood, each booklet
taking him from "service to mankind" to the higher mysteries, until finally
the highest mystery or "illumination" of all is revealed: the real goal of
the organization, world dictatorship - the exact methods and goal of the
18th Century Order of the Illuminati.
Coincidence?
Where do you suppose you apply for a year's subscription to Equals One?
Well, you could write to:
Navajata, General Secretary,
The Auroville Office and the Sri Aurobindo Society,
Pondicherry 2, India.
But why bother?
It's much easier, and faster, to send your $6.00 to:
The Lucis Publishing Company
866 United Nations Plaza
New York, N.Y. 10017
Address your letter to Jack H. T. Albert.
And as you do, be also advised that the Lucis Publishing Company is the
former "Lucifer" Publishing Co. (something about that name bothered people),
and the publishing outlet for Lucis Magazine, the official, self-admitted
magazine of today's
Order of the Illuminati.
Lucis Magazine
Owned by
the Lucis Trust, Lucis Magazine is published by the
Pre-Nicene
[Gnostic] Publishing House, B.C.M. Consortium, W.C.I., London, England, and
edited by a mysterious Italo-Englishmen
Richard Duc de Palatine.
A researcher on the West Coast, who I dare not name because sources of
information would dry up, tells me that The Illuminati use several fronts,
one of which is The Order of
Pleroma, in Los Angeles. Headed by one Stephen
Heller (as fitting a name as Lucifer), it is connected with The Anderson
Institute, a sensitivity training organization advertised in The Free Press,
and other underground papers.
All this is just wild coincidence - and if you don't think so just ask any
member of the staff of Esalen.
But still something is missing. There must be a center; that is, a control
for the direction and coordination of the other centers.
We find it deep in
what we suddenly realize is another front:
THE CENTER LETTER
Deerfield Foundation
Editor: Mrs.
Earl Hubbard [that is,
Barbara Marx Hubbard]
Lakeview, Conn. 06039
This magazine, which advertises itself as "A network of communication for
those forming a coalition of concern for man's future," was started in 1967
and is stabilized on a line running from Auroville in India to the
Temple of
Understanding in Washington, D.C.
Incredibly, the Center Letter, if Letter
No 8, 1968, is to be believed,
"is being sent to libraries and schools
throughout the world, as a public service"!
