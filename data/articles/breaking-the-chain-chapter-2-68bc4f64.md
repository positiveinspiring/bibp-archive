Chapter Two
Jobs in the Illuminati
(or Why They Spend All That Time Training People)
To understand generational programming, it helps to understand WHY
the cult goes to the amount of trouble that it does to place programming
into people. Training represents time and effort, and no one- especially
a cult member- will spend that amount of energy unless there will be
a return on the investment. This will be a simple overview of some of
the more common jobs in the cult. It is not meant to be exhaustive,
or in any way considered to be complete.
The cult has a very organized hierarchy of jobs. Like any large
organization, in order to run smoothly, it needs people who are well
trained in their jobs- so well trained, that they can do their tasks
without even thinking about them. To maintain secrecy, this group must
also have people completely dedicated to not revealing their roles in
the cult- even under threat of death or punishment. The cult wants members
who are completely loyal to the group and its tenets, who never question
the orders they are given. These qualities in group members ensure the
continuance of the cult, and that its secrets are never revealed to
the outside world.
Here is a sampling of some jobs in the cult (not listed in order of
priority)
Informers
These people are trained to observe details and conversations with
photographic recall. They are trained to report to their local cult
leader or hierarchy, or trainer, and will download large amounts of
information under hypnotic trance. Detailed knowledge of conversations
or even documents can often be retrieved in this manner. They are often
used as "plants" to gather information in both governmental
settings, and within the cult meetings.
Breeders
These people are often chosen from childhood to have and breed children.
They may be chosen according to bloodlines, or given in arranged marriages
or cult alliances, to "elevate" the children. A parent will
often sell the services of a child as a breeder to the local cult leader
in return for favors or status. These children are rarely used as a
sacrifice; usually they are given to others in the cult to adopt or
raise, but the breeder is told that any child born to her was "sacrificed"
to prevent her looking for the child. Occasionally, in anarchical cults,
a local leader or parent will have a child as the result of an incestuous
liaison. Such a child is given away or killed, but the mother will be
told the child was given away to a distant branch, and must be given
up.
Prostitutes
Prostitutes can be a male or female of any age. They are trained from
earliest childhood to give sexual favors to one or more adults in return
for payment to the child's parents or their local cult group. Occasionally,
the prostitute may be given to a member of the cult, on a temporary
basis, as a "reward" for a job well done. Child prostitution
is a big business for the cult, and training very young children in
this role is taken very seriously. Child prostitutes are also used to
blackmail political figures or leadership outside the cult.
Pornography
A child used in pornography ( which may include bestiality) can also
be of any age or sex. Child pornography is also big business in the
cult, and includes snuff films. Children are trained in this role from
preschool on, often with the help or approval of the child's parents.
The parents are paid or given favors by the cult in return for selling
their child or allowing their child to be trained in this area.
Media personnel
These are very bright, verbal people. They will be sent to journalism
school and will work for local or regional media upon graduation. These
individuals have many contacts within the organization as well as the
outside world. They write books and articles sympathetic to the Illuministic
viewpoint without ever revealing their true affiliation. They will tend
to do biased research in their articles, favoring only one viewpoint,
such as denying the existence of DID or ritual abuse. For instance,
they will interview only psychiatrists/psychologists sympathetic to
this viewpoint and will skew data to present a convincing picture to
the general public. If necessary, they will outright lie or make up
data to support their viewpoint. There are members of groups whose people
have been purposely trained to try and help formulate public opinion
on the nonexistence of the cult (i.e., cults don't exist, no rational
person would believe this "mass hysteria"). The Illuminists
believe that to control the media is to control the thinking of the
masses. For this reason, they take training media personnel quite seriously.
Helpers at rituals
Cleaners clean up meticulously after rituals. They will scour the site
after a ceremony, rake the area, etc. They are taught this job from
preschool years on.
Preparers set up tables, cloths, candles, and paraphernalia quickly
and efficiently. This job is learned from infancy on. Readers read from
the book of Illumination or local group archives; they also keep copies
of sacred literature in a safe vault and are trained in ancient languages.
Readers are valued for their clear speaking voices and ability to dramatize
important passages and bring them to life.
Cutters are taught to dissect animal or human sacrifices (they are
also known as the "slicers and dicers" of the cult). They
can do a kill quickly, emotionlessly, and efficiently. They are trained
from early childhood on.
Chanters sing, sway, or lead choruses of sacred songs on high holy
occasions.
High Priest/Priestess
The person who holds this job is changed every few years in most groups,
although it may be held longer in smaller, more rural groups. These
people administrate and lead their local cult group as well as coordinate
jobs within the cult, give assignments, and pass on meeting dates given
from the local hierarchy or leadership council. They also will activate
the local group's telephone tree, evaluate their local group members
for job performance, and lead in all spiritual activities. They report
to the local or regional leadership council over their group.
Trainers
These people teach local group members their assigned jobs and monitor
the performance of these jobs at local group meetings or after an assigned
task. These people report to the high priest/priestess over their group,
as well as to the local head trainer on leadership council.
Punishers
These are the people who brutally punish/discipline members
caught breaking rules or acting outside of or above their authority.
They are universally despised by other cult members, although they will
be praised for a job well done by the local high priest or priestess.
Usually physically strong, they will employ any method deemed necessary
to prevent a recurrence of the undesired behavior. Punishment may be
public or private, depending upon the severity of the infraction. Each
local group has several punishers.
Trackers
These people will track down and keep an eye on members who attempt
to leave their local group. They are taught to use dogs, guns, taser,
and all necessary tracking techniques. They are also adept at using
the internet to monitor a person's activities. They will track credit
card use, checks written, and employ other methods to find a missing
person.
Teachers
These people teach group classes to children to indoctrinate cult philosophy,
languages, and specialized areas of endeavor.
Child care
These people care for very young children when the adults are at local
group meeting. Usually care is for young infants only. After age two,
children are routinely engaged in some form of group activity led by
trainers of the youngest children. Infant child care workers are usually
quiet and coldly efficient.
Couriers
These members run guns, money, drugs, or illegal artifacts across state
or national lines. Usually they are people who are young and single
without outside accountability. They are trained in the use of firearms
to get out of difficult situations. They must be reliable and able to
get past any anticipated barriers.
Commanding officers
These people oversee military training in the local groups and help
ensure the smooth running of these exercises. They will delegate jobs
to those ranking under them and are responsible to the local leadership
council. The council will have at least one member on it representing
the military branch of the Illuminati. In addition, there are many military-
related jobs beneath the commanding officers.
Behavioral scientists
These individuals often oversee the training in local and regional
groups. These students of human behavior are intensely involved in data
collection and human experimentation in the name of the pursuit of knowledge
of human behavior in the scientific realm. They are almost universally
cold, methodical, impersonal people and will employ any methods to study
trauma and its effects on the human personality. Their main interest
centers around implementing programming and cult control in the most
efficient and lasting manner.
There are many other jobs inside the cult. The cult spends quite a
bit of its time getting people to do these jobs for them for FREE, which
is why they PROGRAM people to believe they are doing their "family"
and the world a service. The reality, of course, is that the individual
is being abused and taken advantage of by the cult.
