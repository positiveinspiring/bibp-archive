If you answered no, you have good reason - the
federal government has had
13 breaches and failures of its own cybersecurity just in the last six
months.
Yet the President and his allies in the Senate
are pushing forward to regulate Americas cyber-doings, without any clues
about how much this will cost us or how it will work.
Its become the norm with this President - if
Congress fails to accomplish his objectives, he goes around it with
executive orders and federal regulations. Hes doing it again.
Congress did not pass the
Cybersecurity Act of 2012 before the election, so the President has
issued a draft of an executive order to put much of that legislation in
place without lawmakers voting.
Not to be left behind, though, Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) may try to get another vote on the bill
before the end of the year - some are saying as soon as this week.
If the idea of cybersecurity - trying to secure
all of the countrys sensitive computer networks and data - sounds abstract,
thats because it is. Its so abstract, in fact, that the legislation and
executive order our leaders are pushing offer few details about what they
would actually do, other than piling more confusing regulations onto
businesses.
When you think about it, the idea of the federal
government trying to be on the cutting edge of technological security is
pretty laughable.
As Heritages David Inserra
notes:
Simply put, government regulations usually
take 24-36 month to complete, but the power of computers doubles every
18-24 months. This means that any standards developed will be written
for threats that are two or three computer generations old.
A federal government that stays hopelessly
behind the curve and cant even secure its own networks doesnt exactly
inspire confidence.
But oh, it can regulate!
The Presidents executive order would give
multiple federal agencies new power to regulate businesses. It would work
much like Obamacare, which passed with few details but gave agencies like
Health and Human Services a blank check to write regulations.
One of the incentives it may use to keep
businesses in line is favoritism in awarding federal contracts - businesses
that met the governments cybersecurity standards could be moved to the head
of the line.
Heritage visiting fellow Paul Rosenzweig
will explain in a new Issue Brief due out tomorrow that,
this order will likely be very significant
and very costly while not providing important cybersecurity solutions,
such as effective information sharing.
-
How much will it cost businesses to
comply with all these new (yet perpetually outdated) regulations? We
dont know.
-
Will the standards be voluntary or
mandatory? Also unknown.
-
Can companies
share information about cyber-threats they have detected, with
confidence that their sensitive information will be protected? No
guarantees.
With so many unanswered questions, the executive
order - or the legislation - would create massive headaches for businesses
and could hinder innovation. Just what the economy needs.

From the
"it's-so-secure-it's-secret" department...
While we're hearing that the Senate is likely to
take up (though not pass) the Cybersecurity Act yet again either today
or tomorrow, and the White House is still
sitting on a cybersecurity "executive order," in the meantime it's being
reported that President Obama has
signed a "secret directive" to allow the military to "act more aggressively
to thwart cyberattacks."
This is limited to the military, but that means
we're talking about the NSA (which is a part of the Defense Department).
Considering that it seems to view a stronger offensive effort (i.e.,
collecting all data) a key part of a strong "defense," this is
worrisome.
The really troubling part in all of this is the really unnecessary level of
secrecy. We keep being told scary bogeyman stories about online attacks
without any evidence or proof.
And now the President is signing a "secret"
order allowing the military to do more in response? Without any real
scrutiny, it's not difficult to see how these things expand unceasingly and
are wide open for abuse.
Given the NSA's track record here, it's
inevitable that these efforts will be massively abused.
