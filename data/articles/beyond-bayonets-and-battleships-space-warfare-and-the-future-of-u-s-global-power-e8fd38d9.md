Its 2025 and an American triple canopy of advanced surveillance and armed
drones fills the heavens from the lower- to the exo-atmosphere.
A wonder of the modern age, it can deliver its
weaponry anywhere on the planet with staggering speed, knock out an enemys
satellite communications system, or follow individuals biometrically for
great distances.
Along with the countrys advanced cyberwar
capacity, its also the most sophisticated militarized information system
ever created and an insurance policy for U.S. global dominion deep into the
twenty-first century.
Its the future as the Pentagon imagines it; its
under development; and Americans know nothing about it.
They are still operating in another age.
Our Navy is smaller now than at
any time since 1917, complained Republican candidate Mitt Romney during the
last presidential debate.
With words of withering mockery, President Obama shot back:
Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses
and bayonets, because the nature of our militarys changed
the question
is not a game of Battleship, where were counting ships. Its what are
our capabilities.
Obama later offered just a hint of what those
capabilities might be:
What I did was work with our joint chiefs
of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make
sure that we are safe?
We need to be thinking about cyber security. We
need to be talking about space.
Amid all the post-debate media chatter, however,
not a single commentator seemed to have a clue when it came to the profound
strategic changes encoded in the presidents sparse words.
Yet for the past four years, working in silence
and secrecy,
the Obama administration has presided over a technological
revolution in defense planning, moving the nation far beyond bayonets and
battleships to cyberwarfare and the full-scale weaponization of space.
In the face of waning economic influence, this
bold new breakthrough in whats called information warfare may prove
significantly responsible should U.S. global dominion somehow continue far
into the twenty-first century.
While the technological changes involved are nothing less than
revolutionary, they have deep historical roots in a distinctive style of
American global power. Its been evident from the moment this nation first
stepped onto the world stage with its conquest of the Philippines in 1898.
Over the span of a century, plunged into three
Asian crucibles of counterinsurgency - in the Philippines, Vietnam, and
Afghanistan - the U.S. military has repeatedly been pushed to the breaking
point. It has repeatedly responded by fusing the nations most advanced
technologies into new information infrastructures of unprecedented power.
That military first created a manual information regime for Philippine
pacification, then a computerized apparatus to fight communist guerrillas in
Vietnam.
Finally, during its decade-plus in Afghanistan
(and its years in Iraq), the Pentagon has begun to fuse biometrics,
cyberwarfare, and a potential future triple canopy aerospace shield into a
robotic information regime that could produce a platform of unprecedented
power for the exercise of global dominion - or for future military disaster.
Americas First
Information Revolution
This distinctive U.S. system of imperial information gathering (and the
surveillance and war-making practices that go with it) traces its origins to
some brilliant American innovations in the management of textual,
statistical, and visual data.
Their sum was nothing less than a new
information infrastructure with an unprecedented capacity for mass
surveillance.
During two extraordinary decades, American inventions like,
-
Thomas Alva
Edisons quadruplex telegraph (1874)
-
Philo Remingtons commercial typewriter
(1874)
-
Melvil Deweys library decimal system (1876)
-
Herman
Holleriths patented punch card (1889),
...created synergies that led to the
militarized application of Americas first information revolution.
To pacify a determined guerrilla resistance that
persisted in the Philippines for a decade after 1898, the U.S. colonial
regime - unlike European empires with their cultural studies of Oriental
civilizations - used these advanced information technologies to amass
detailed empirical data on Philippine society. In this way, they forged an
Argus-eyed security apparatus that played a major role in crushing the
Filipino nationalist movement.
The resulting colonial policing and surveillance
system would also leave a lasting institutional imprint on the emerging
American state.
When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, the father of U.S. military
intelligence Colonel Ralph Van Deman drew upon security methods he
had developed years before in the Philippines to found the Armys Military
Intelligence Division. He recruited a staff that quickly grew from one
(himself) to 1,700, deployed some 300,000 citizen-operatives to compile more
than a million pages of surveillance reports on American citizens, and laid
the foundations for a permanent domestic surveillance apparatus.
A version of this system rose to unparalleled success during World War II
when Washington established the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as the
nations first worldwide espionage agency.
Among its nine branches, Research & Analysis
recruited a staff of nearly 2,000 academics who amassed 300,000 photographs,
a million maps, and three million file cards, which they deployed in an
information system via indexing, cross-indexing, and counter-indexing to
answer countless tactical questions.
Yet by early 1944, the OSS found itself, in the words of historian Robin
Winks,
drowning under the flow of information.
Many of the materials it had so carefully
collected were left to molder in storage, unread and unprocessed.
Despite its ambitious global reach, this first
U.S. information regime, absent technological change, might well have
collapsed under its own weight, slowing the flow of foreign intelligence
that would prove so crucial for Americas exercise of global dominion after
World War II.
Computerizing Vietnam
Under the pressures of a never-ending war in Vietnam, those running the U.S.
information infrastructure turned to computerized data management, launching
a second American information regime.
Powered by the most advanced IBM mainframe
computers, the U.S. military compiled monthly tabulations of security in all
of South Vietnams 12,000 villages and filed the three million enemy
documents its soldiers captured annually on giant reels of bar-coded film.
At the same time, the CIA collated and
computerized diverse data on the communist civilian infrastructure as part
of its infamous Phoenix Program.
This, in turn, became the basis for its
systematic tortures and 41,000 extra-judicial executions (which, based on
disinformation from petty local grudges and communist counterintelligence,
killed many but failed to capture more than a handful of top communist
cadres).
Most ambitiously, the U.S. Air Force spent $800 million a year to lace
southern Laos with a network of 20,000 acoustic, seismic, thermal, and
ammonia-sensitive sensors to pinpoint Hanois truck convoys coming down the
Ho Chi Minh Trail under a heavy jungle canopy.
The information these
provided was then gathered on computerized systems for the targeting of
incessant bombing runs.
After 100,000 North Vietnamese troops passed
right through this electronic grid undetected with trucks, tanks, and heavy
artillery to launch the Nguyen Hue Offensive in 1972, the U.S. Pacific Air
Force pronounced this bold attempt to build an electronic battlefield an
unqualified failure.
In this pressure cooker of what became historys largest air war, the Air
Force also accelerated the transformation of a new information system that
would rise to significance three decades later: the
Firebee target drone. By
wars end, it had morphed into an increasingly agile unmanned aircraft that
would make 3,500 top-secret surveillance sorties over China, North Vietnam,
and Laos.
By 1972, the SC/TV drone, with a camera in its
nose, was capable of flying 2,400 miles while navigating via a
low-resolution television image.
On balance, all this computerized data helped foster the illusion that
American pacification programs in the countryside were winning over the
inhabitants of Vietnams villages, and the delusion that the air war was
successfully destroying North Vietnams supply effort.
Despite a dismal succession of short-term
failures that helped deliver a soul-searing blow to American power, all this
computerized data-gathering proved a seminal experiment, even if its
advances would not become evident for another 30 years until the U.S. began
creating a third - robotic - information regime.
The Global War on
Terror
As it found itself at the edge of defeat in the attempted pacification of
two complex societies, Afghanistan and Iraq, Washington responded in part by
adapting new technologies of electronic surveillance, biometric
identification, and drone warfare - all of which are now melding into what
may become an information regime far more powerful and destructive than
anything that has come before.
After six years of a failing counterinsurgency effort in Iraq, the Pentagon
discovered the power of biometric identification and electronic surveillance
to pacify the countrys sprawling cities.
It then built a biometric database with more
than a million Iraqi fingerprints and iris scans that U.S. patrols on the
streets of Baghdad could access instantaneously by satellite link to a
computer center in West Virginia.
When President Obama took office and launched his surge, escalating
the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan, that country became a new frontier for
testing and perfecting such biometric databases, as well as for full-scale
drone war in both that country and the Pakistani tribal borderlands, the
latest wrinkle in a technowar already loosed by the Bush administration.
This meant accelerating technological
developments in drone warfare that had largely been suspended for two
decades after the Vietnam War.
Launched as an experimental, unarmed surveillance aircraft in 1994, the
Predator drone was first deployed in 2000 for combat surveillance under the
CIAs Operation Afghan Eyes.
By 2011, the advanced
MQ-9 Reaper drone, with
persistent hunter killer capabilities, was heavily armed with missiles and
bombs as well as sensors that could read disturbed dirt at 5,000 feet and
track footprints back to enemy installations. Indicating the torrid pace of
drone development, between 2004 and 2010 total flying time for all unmanned
vehicles rose from just 71 hours to 250,000 hours.
By 2009, the Air Force and the CIA were already deploying a drone armada of
at least 195 Predators and 28 Reapers inside Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan
- and its only grown since.
These collected and transmitted 16,000 hours of
video daily, and from 2006-2012 fired hundreds of Hellfire missiles that
killed an estimated 2,600 supposed insurgents inside Pakistans tribal
areas. Though the second-generation Reaper drones might seem stunningly
sophisticated, one defense analyst has called them very much Model T
Fords.
Beyond the battlefield, there are now some 7,000
drones in the U.S. armada of unmanned aircraft, including 800 larger
missile-firing drones.
By funding its own fleet of 35 drones and
borrowing others from the Air Force,
the CIA has moved beyond passive
intelligence collection to build a permanent robotic paramilitary capacity.
In the same years, another form of information warfare came, quite
literally, online.
Over two administrations, there has been
continuity in the development of a cyberwarfare capability at home and
abroad. Starting in 2002, President
George W. Bush illegally authorized the
National
Security Agency to scan countless millions of electronic messages
with its top-secret Pinwale database.
Similarly, the FBI started an Investigative Data
Warehouse that, by 2009, held a billion individual records.
Under Presidents Bush and Obama, defensive digital surveillance has grown
into an offensive cyberwarfare capacity, which has already been deployed
against Iran in historys first significant cyberwar.
In 2009, the Pentagon formed U.S. Cyber Command
(CYBERCOM), with headquarters at Ft. Meade, Maryland, and a cyberwarfare
center at Lackland Air Base in Texas, staffed by 7,000 Air Force employees.
Two years later, it declared cyberspace an
operational domain like air, land, or sea, and began putting its energy
into developing a cadre of cyber-warriors capable of launching offensive
operations, such as a variety of attacks on the computerized centrifuges in
Irans nuclear facilities and Middle Eastern banks handling Iranian money.
A Robotic Information
Regime
As with the Philippine Insurrection and the Vietnam War, the occupations of
Iraq and Afghanistan have served as the catalyst for a new information
regime, fusing aerospace, cyberspace, biometrics, and robotics into an
apparatus of potentially unprecedented power.
In 2012, after years of ground warfare in both
countries and the continuous expansion of the Pentagon budget, the Obama
administration announced a leaner future defense strategy.
It included a 14%
cut in future infantry strength to be compensated for by an increased
emphasis on investments in the dominions of outer space and cyberspace,
particularly in what the administration calls critical space-based
capabilities.
By 2020, this new defense architecture should theoretically be able to
integrate space, cyberspace, and terrestrial combat through robotics for -
so the claims go - the delivery of seamless information for lethal action.
Significantly, both space and cyberspace are
new, unregulated domains of military conflict, largely beyond international
law.
And Washington hopes to use both, without
limitation, as Archimedean levers to exercise new forms of global dominion
far into the twenty-first century, just as the British Empire once ruled
from the seas and the Cold War
American imperium exercised its global
reach via airpower.
As Washington seeks to surveil the globe from space, the world might well
ask: Just how high is national sovereignty? Absent any international
agreement about the vertical extent of sovereign airspace (since a
conference on international air law, convened in Paris in 1910, failed),
some puckish Pentagon lawyer might reply: only as high as you can enforce
it.
And Washington has filled this legal void with a
secret executive matrix - operated by the CIA and the clandestine Special
Operations Command - that assigns names arbitrarily, without any judicial
oversight, to a classified kill list that means silent, sudden death from
the sky for terror suspects across the Muslim world.
Although U.S. plans for space warfare remain highly classified, it is
possible to assemble the pieces of this aerospace puzzle by trolling the
Pentagons websites, and finding many of the key components in technical
descriptions at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
As early as 2020, the Pentagon hopes to patrol
the entire globe ceaselessly, relentlessly via a triple canopy space shield
reaching from stratosphere to exosphere, driven by drones armed with agile
missiles, linked by a resilient modular satellite system, monitored through
a telescopic panopticon, and operated by robotic controls.
At the lowest tier of this emerging U.S. aerospace shield, within striking
distance of Earth in the lower stratosphere, the Pentagon is building an
armada of 99 Global Hawk drones equipped with high-resolution cameras
capable of surveilling all terrain within a 100-mile radius, electronic
sensors to intercept communications, efficient engines for continuous
24-hour flights, and eventually Triple Terminator missiles to destroy
targets below.
By late 2011, the Air Force and the CIA had
already ringed the Eurasian land mass with a network of 60 bases for drones
armed with Hellfire missiles and GBU-30 bombs, allowing air strikes against
targets just about anywhere in Europe, Africa, or Asia.
The sophistication of the technology at this level was exposed in December
2011 when one of the CIAs RQ-170 Sentinels came down in Iran. Revealed was
a bat-winged drone equipped with radar-evading stealth capacity, active
electronically scanned array radar, and advanced optics that allow
operators to positively identify terror suspects from tens of thousands of
feet in the air.
If things go according to plan, in this same lower tier at altitudes up to
12 miles unmanned aircraft such as the Vulture, with solar panels covering
its massive 400-foot wingspan, will be patrolling the globe ceaselessly for
up to five years at a time with sensors for unblinking surveillance, and
possibly missiles for lethal strikes.
Establishing the viability of this new
technology, NASAs solar-powered aircraft Pathfinder, with a 100-foot
wingspan, reached an altitude of 71,500 feet altitude in 1997, and its
fourth-generation successor the Helios flew at 97,000 feet with a 247-foot
wingspan in 2001, two miles higher than any previous aircraft.
For the next tier above the Earth, in the upper stratosphere, DARPA and the
Air Force are collaborating in the development of the
Falcon Hypersonic
Cruise Vehicle.
Flying at an altitude of 20 miles, it is
expected to,
deliver 12,000 pounds of payload at a
distance of 9,000 nautical miles from the continental United States in
less than two hours.
Although the first test launches in April 2010
and August 2011 crashed midflight, they did reach an amazing 13,000 miles
per hour, 22 times the speed of sound, and sent back unique data that
should help resolve remaining aerodynamic problems.
At the outer level of this triple-tier aerospace canopy, the age of space
warfare dawned in April 2010 when the Pentagon quietly launched the
X-37B
space drone, an unmanned craft just 29 feet long, into an orbit 250 miles
above the Earth.
By the time its second prototype landed at
Vandenberg Air Force Base in June 2012 after a 15-month flight, this
classified mission represented a successful test of robotically controlled
reusable spacecraft and established the viability of unmanned space drones
in the exosphere.
At this apex of the triple canopy, 200 miles above Earth where the space
drones will soon roam, orbital satellites are the prime targets, a
vulnerability that became obvious in 2007 when China used a ground-to-air
missile to shoot down one of its own satellites.
In response, the Pentagon
is now developing the F-6 satellite system that will,
decompose a large
monolithic spacecraft into a group of wirelessly linked elements, or nodes
[that increases] resistance to
a bad part breaking or an adversary
attacking.
And keep in mind that the X-37B has a capacious cargo bay to
carry missiles or future laser weaponry to knock out enemy satellites - in
other words, the potential capability to cripple the communications of a
future military rival like China, which will have its own global satellite
system operational by 2020.
Ultimately, the impact of this third information regime will be shaped by
the ability of the U.S. military to integrate its array of global aerospace
weaponry into a robotic command structure that would be capable of
coordinating operations across all combat domains: space, cyberspace, sky,
sea, and land.
To manage the surging torrent of information within this
delicately balanced triple canopy, the system would, in the end, have to
become self-maintaining through robotic manipulator technologies, such as
the Pentagons FREND system that someday could potentially deliver fuel,
provide repairs, or reposition satellites.
For a new global optic, DARPA is building the wide-angle Space Surveillance
Telescope (SST), which could be sited at bases ringing the globe for a
quantum leap in space surveillance.
The system would allow future space warriors to
see the whole sky wrapped around the entire planet while seated before a
single screen, making it possible to track every object in Earth orbit.
Operation of this complex worldwide apparatus will require, as one DARPA
official explained in 2007,
an integrated collection of space surveillance
systems - an architecture - that is leak-proof.
Thus, by 2010, the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency had 16,000 employees, a $5 billion budget,
and a massive $2 billion headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, with 8,500
staffers wrapped in electronic security - all aimed at coordinating the
flood of surveillance data pouring in from Predators, Reapers, U-2 spy
planes, Global Hawks, X-37B space drones, Google Earth, Space Surveillance
Telescopes, and orbiting satellites.
By 2020 or thereafter - such a complex
techno-system is unlikely to respect schedules - this triple canopy should
be able to atomize a single terrorist with a missile strike after tracking
his eyeball, facial image, or heat signature for hundreds of miles through
field and favela, or blind an entire army by knocking out all ground
communications, avionics, and naval navigation.
Technological Dominion
or Techno-Disaster?
Peering into the future, a still uncertain balance of forces offers two
competing scenarios for the continuation of U.S. global power.
If all or much goes according to plan, sometime
in the third decade of this century the Pentagon will complete a
comprehensive global surveillance system for Earth, sky, and space using
robotics to coordinate a veritable flood of data from biometric street-level
monitoring, cyber-data mining, a worldwide network of Space Surveillance
Telescopes, and triple canopy aeronautic patrols.
Through agile data management of exceptional
power, this system might allow the United States a veto of global lethality,
an equalizer for any further loss of economic strength.
However, as in Vietnam, history offers some pessimistic parallels when it
comes to the U.S. preserving its global hegemony by militarized technology
alone.
Even if this robotic information regime could
somehow check Chinas growing military power, the U.S. might still have the
same chance of controlling wider geopolitical forces with aerospace
technology as the Third Reich had of winning World War II with its super
weapons - V-2 rockets that rained death on London and Messerschmitt Me-262
jets that blasted allied bombers from Europes skies.
Complicating the future further, the illusion of
information omniscience might incline Washington to more military
misadventures akin to Vietnam or Iraq, creating the possibility of yet more
expensive, draining conflicts, from Iran to the South China Sea.
If the future of Americas world power is shaped by actual events rather
than long-term economic trends, then its fate might well be determined by
which comes first in this century-long cycle:
military debacle from the
illusion of technological mastery, or a new technological regime powerful
enough to perpetuate U.S. global dominion.
