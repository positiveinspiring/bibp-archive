The below you tube video is an excellent presentation about the modern history of persistent mass psychological mind control as well as critical knowledge for those who seek deeper truths about why humans behave as we do. Science, as well as Big Business, has studied for decades and decades our brains as to how to control what we think, what we think as well as how we act and behave while having us believe it is really our own ideas and thoughts that create individual behavior patterns. Even the brightest humans only use 12%-15% of their brains while the remain brain activities are in the subconscious level.
The power to program the subconscious mind without a person even knowing is relatively easy through symbology, suggestive programming and even the flicker rates of the TV, video games, etc. to control brainwave patterns.
This has been known since the 1960s, and was most notably proven in an experiment in 1969, by Herbert Krugman. The research, undertaken by Krugman as part of a larger project concerned with advertising, revealed that the brains left hemisphere, which processes information logically and analytically, effectively tunes out almost completely when an individual watches television.The radiant light and flicker rate of television screens cause brain activity to drop toward more of a theta state. Critical thinking reduces, leaving the parts of the brain that hold memories, sensations and emotions the most active. Whatever is coming from the TV therefore somewhat bypasses the logical mind and is embedded directly into the subconscious. In other words, TV appeals more to emotions than logic. Numerous studies have also found that flicker rates in video games cause altered consciousness. Some have been shown to reduce brain activity to below Delta frequency. Other studies have also flagged up a link between watching too much television and Alzheimers disease. The semi conscious state induced by television is thought to directly contribute to the symptoms of memory, speech and perception problems. (Source)

This is also why we are led, literally by mind control, to believe we are powerless to change what must be changed and to never challenge the powers that should not be. This is why electronic mediums are so important to the Occult (hidden) agendas to keep all pacified and docile and never, ever question authority. It is their way of programming the masses.
This is also why what we watch on TV is called "Programming"
"State Of Mind - The Psychology Of Control," from the creators of "A Noble Lie - Oklahoma City 1995," reveals that much of what we believe to be truth is actually deliberate deception.
The global elites are systematically implanting lies into our consciousness to erect a "tyranny over the minds of men."
This film exposes the mind control methods being used to turn our once vibrant society into a land of obedient sheeple.
Are we controlled? To what extent and by whom? What does it mean for humanitys future?
Are we controlled?
To what extent and by whom?
What does it mean for humanitys future?
From cradle to grave our parents, peers, institutions and society inform our values and behaviors but this process has been hijacked.
State Of Mind examines the science of control that has evolved over generations to keep us firmly in place so that dictators, power brokers and corporate puppeteers may profit from our ignorance and slavery.
From the anvil of compulsory schooling to media and entertainment, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. State Of Mind delves into the abyss to expose the true agendas at work. This film reveals the secret manipulations at work and provides shocking and suppressed historical and current examples.
From the ancient roots of the control of human behavior to its maturity in the mind control experiments of intelligence agencies and other organs of manipulation, State Of Mind reveals a plan for the future that drives home the dreadful price of our ignorance.
