World food inflation is smashing down on the
worlds populations as prices rise precipitously in the face of increasing
shortages and absurd monetary policies.
Prices are rising everywhere. It is not millions
but billions of people who must tighten their belts because they have no
choice but to eat less. Billions of people on our planet have no
discretionary funds so they just cannot afford the increased prices.
They have to get by with less to eat. They have
no choice.
Things can get so bad that people will not be able to buy foods at any price
because they simply will not be available because they have been bought up
by someone else. I am not talking about your neighbor here who just happened
to beat you to the supermarket this morning.
Imagine if China pulls out a $100 billion out of
its almost bottomless pockets and purchases grain to feed its billions? Why
wouldnt they, after all, spend increasingly worthless paper on a mountain
of food?
Below you will see that this is a real threat because of the drought that is
going on there. Other governments are already stockpiling food staples in an
attempt to contain panic buying, inflation and social unrest.
There is nothing pretty about this quickly
evolving food catastrophe and with each week the story only becomes
gloomier.
The price of wheat is up 78.13 percent over
the past 12 months and still going higher.
Everywhere we turn we see dramatic climate
events taking their toll on crops.
The
cold weather experienced across much of the
U.S. in early February made its way deep into Mexico and early reports
estimate 80-100 percent crop losses, which are having an immediate impact on
prices in U.S. grocery stores with more volatility to come.
As a result, prices on cucumbers, zucchini,
peppers, tomatoes and asparagus are set to explode in the states if in fact
there will be much of any of these vegetables available at all.
Storms in Chinas far western Xinjiang flattened
or damaged
about 100,000 homes, and more than 15,000 head of livestock
were killed by the cold front that set in on the 16th of January.
Minimal rainfall or snow this winter has
crippled Chinas major agricultural regions, leaving many of them parched.
Crop production has fallen sharply as the worst
drought in six decades shows no sign of letting up.
A severe drought has
persisted in Chinas northern territories for several months.
In Hebei province, the farmers havent seen any
rain for five months. What is going on in China has global breadbasket
implications.
So dire is the situation becoming that,
If the weather turns warmer and there is
still no rain, then we will not be talking about lower agricultural
production, but rather zero production, because the seedlings will all
be dead,
reported one Chinese official.
Wheat prices in Chicago jumped nearly two
percent on the 8th of February when the United Nations food
agency issued a rare alert that Chinas crop was in trouble.
Record-breaking snowfall
pounded South Koreas
east coast last Saturday when waist-deep snow stranded hundreds of motorists
on highways and destroyed dozens of houses.
The roofs of dozens of houses, livestock sheds,
vinyl greenhouses - even a bowling alley - collapsed under the weight of the
snow. According to the Gangwon Regional Meteorological Administration, the
two-day snowfall in the area reached,
-
43 inches (110 cm) in Samcheok
-
39
inches (100.1 cm) in Donghae
-
22 inches (56.3 cm) in Daegwallyeong mountain
pass
-
17 inches (42.8 cm) in Sokcho
Before Korea was hit it was Vietnam.
After enduring a freezing cold with
temperatures in mountainous areas dropping to -4Â°C,
northern Vietnam is
undergoing another fresh cold snap. The record low temperature this year had
frozen over 7,000 buffaloes and cows to death in more than 12 northern
mountainous provinces, said Deputy Head of the Livestock Breeding Department
Nguyen Thanh Son.
The location has been changing week by week but its one place on the planet
after another being hit with agriculturally destructive weather patterns.
Global food production and supply are being
beaten down just as financial and monetary inflation also takes hold.
Financial-Sourced
Causes of Price Increases
Nasty weather in key agricultural markets
around the world has savaged the global grain crop, meaning worldwide
supplies cant help but be squeezed.
Australia, for instance, is
experiencing
additional flooding in areas that were already battered by the
torrential rains of November, December and January. And as if the
supply-related increase in agricultural commodities wasnt enough,
theres also the U.S. dollar - and the so-called race to the bottom -
to contend with.
Make no mistake: The endless devaluations in
the greenback are having a worldwide impact on agricultural commodity
prices. Since commodities are priced in dollars, these devaluations
translate into higher prices for grains and other food-related
commodities,
writes Jack Barnes.
The
Federal Reserve is printing money almost
limitlessly now to extend the life of the United States government that is
addicted to increasing debt and deficits.
They are injecting money (debt) at a furious
pace producing stacks of fine quality paper with colored ink. This blatant
act of self-preservation is striking hard at the lower and middle classes
around the world who have to pay higher and higher prices for their food,
which on international markets is denominated in dollars.
The day of reckoning for the dollar inches
closer every day, as the Fed issues more Treasuries and floods the market
with more devalued paper. Inevitably, this will cause prices to rise faster
and faster as the value of U.S. currency drops further, pushing food prices
up and up the side of a steep slope.
The world is paying for American debt in terms
of high food and energy prices.
So, the present tragedy is going to be
compounded by too much money chasing the availability of food.
Even in America, if you are not financially
independent, the odds are good that someday you could be
waiting in line to
feed yourself and your family. Its a mistake, even at this early point, to
take this delicious-looking bread for granted.
We are not allowing yet onto our collective radar screens exactly what we
are facing in the months and years ahead. The world is still looking normal
for the haves but those who have less feel the avalanche of climbing food
prices.
We are only at the very beginning of a crisis
that has going to get much worse written all over it.
