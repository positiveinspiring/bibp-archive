Fraternities, sororities and football, along with other outsized athletic
programs, have decimated most major American universities.
Scholarship, inquiry, self-criticism, moral
autonomy and a search for artistic and esoteric forms of expression - in
short, the world of ethics, creativity and ideas - are shouted down by the
drunken chants of fans in huge stadiums, the pathetic demands of rich alumni
for national championships, and the elitism, racism and rigid definition of
gender roles of Greek organizations.
These hypermasculine systems perpetuate a
culture of conformity and intolerance. They have inverted the traditional
values of scholarship to turn four years of college into a mindless quest
for collective euphoria and athletic dominance.
There is probably no more inhospitable place to be an intellectual, or a
person of color or a member of the LGBT community, than on the campuses of
the Big Ten Conference colleges, although the poison of this bizarre
American obsession has infected innumerable schools.
These environments are distinctly corporate. To
get ahead one must get along. The student is implicitly told his or her
self-worth and fulfillment are found in crowds, in mass emotions, rather
than individual transcendence.
Those who do not pay deference to the
celebration of force, wealth and power become freaks.
It is a war on knowledge in the name of
knowledge.
Knowledge, as
C. Wright Mills wrote in 'The Power
Elite,' is no longer widely felt as an ideal; it is seen as an
instrument. In a society of power and wealth, knowledge is valued as an
instrument of power and wealth, and also, of course, as an ornament in
conversation.
There are few university presidents or faculty
members willing to fight back.
Most presidents are overcompensated fundraisers
licking the boots of every millionaire who arrives on campus. They are like
court eunuchs. They cater to the demands of the hedge fund managers
and financial speculators on their trustee boards, half of whom should be in
jail, and most of whom revel in this collective self-worship. And they do
not cross the football coach, who not only earns more than they do but has
much more power on the campus.
One of the last great university presidents was
James O. Freedman of Dartmouth. His
integrity and courage were matched by his deep and abiding love of learning.
He arrived in Hanover, N.H., determined to do
battle with Dartmouths entrenched culture of elitism, white male
entitlement, fraternities and football. He did not have an easy tenure. The
Dartmouth Review published a cover article that depicted Freedman, who was
Jewish, as Hitler and wrote that he was orchestrating the final solution
to traditional conservatism at Dartmouth.
Freedman had told the college in his inaugural address:
We must strengthen our attraction for those
singular students whose greatest pleasures may come not from the
camaraderie of classmates but from the lonely acts of writing poetry or
mastering the cello or solving mathematical riddles or translating
Catullus.
We must make Dartmouth a hospitable
environment for students who march to a different drummer - for those
creative loners and daring dreamers whose commitment to the intellectual
and artistic life is so compelling that they appreciate, as Prospero
reminded Shakespeares audiences, that for certain persons a library is
dukedom large enough.
But Freedmans imprint, once he departed, faded.
Fraternity and football culture reasserted itself at Dartmouth.
A former Dartmouth fraternity member, Andrew
Lohse, who is profiled in
an April article in Rolling Stone, was
ostracized not only by the students but the university administration for
his public exposure of hazing and abuse.
I was a member of a fraternity that asked
pledges, in order to become a brother, to: swim in a kiddie pool of
vomit, urine, fecal matter, semen and rotten food products; eat omelets
made of vomit; chug cups of vinegar, which in one case caused a pledge
to vomit blood; drink beer poured down fellow pledges ass cracks...
among other abuses, he wrote in the magazine.
He accused Dartmouths 17 fraternities, 11
sororities and three coed houses, to which roughly half of the student body
belongs, of perpetuating a culture of pervasive hazing, substance abuse and
sexual assault, as well as an intoxicating nihilism that dominates campus
social life.
One of the things Ive learned at Dartmouth
- one thing that sets a psychological precedent for many Dartmouth men -
is that good people can do awful things to one another for absolutely no
reason, he said.
Fraternity life is at the core of the
colleges human and cultural dysfunctions.
Harassment and physical violence by athletic
teams and Greek organizations on American campuses is real.
They use these threats to keep critics cowed and
their entitlement secure. Any attack mounted against football programs or
Greek organizations becomes an attack against the group identity that gives
followers their sense of prestige and empowerment.
And all those who question or criticize these
organizations are treated as the enemy.
When the Rev.
William Sloan Coffin led the fight to
shut down fraternities at Williams College, someone fired a shot through the
window of his house. Vicky Triponey, Penn States vice president for
student affairs, became a nonperson when she attempted to discipline half a
dozen football players who had been involved in a brawl in which several
students were injured and one was beaten unconscious.
Football coach Joe Paterno acidly referred to
her in a radio interview as that lady in Old Main (the central
administration building) who couldnt possibly know how to handle students
because she didnt have kids.
The coach angrily told Triponey that his players
would not cooperate with any investigation because they would not rat on
each other. Penn State President Graham Spanier asked her pointedly
if she really embraced the Penn State way.
Triponey received threatening phone calls. She
was denounced on student message boards. Her house was vandalized. A for
sale sign was put up in her front yard. She was no longer invited to
university events, fellow faculty and administrative staff avoided her, and
people turned their backs on her in the supermarket.
Spanier successfully pressured her to resign in
2007. Her husband found work at the University of South Carolinas medical
school in Charleston, and the couple moved.
Hazing, comradeship and complicity in sexual abuse, including rape, make up
the glue that holds campus sports teams and fraternity houses together. The
National Study of Student Hazing reports that 73 percent of U.S.
fraternities and sororities haze. Since 1970, at least one student has died
each year from hazing. Eighty-two percent of these deaths have resulted from
alcohol poisoning.
Hazing weeds out those with enough self-esteem
and independence to stand up to the hierarchy. It ensures conformity and
obedience. These groups are, in essence, self-selected. Those who have the
fortitude and courage to oppose their own public humiliation and the public
humiliation perpetuated with each new cycle of recruits or pledges leave.
Those who remain conform.
Athletic recruiting parties, like fraternity
parties, at schools across the country are plagued by gang rapes and sexual
assaults. And these crimes, known by all in the fraternity or on the team,
are met, in locker rooms and Greek houses, with the culture of silence,
mocking the stated missions of the schools.
Bernard Lefkowitz captured the sickness
of this culture in his book Our
Guys.
Lefkowitz wrote about a group of high school
athletes in Glen Ridge, N.J., who in 1989 lured a 17-year-old
developmentally disabled girl to a basement. The boys sexually abused her
with a broomstick and a baseball bat. And when the assault became public,
the town rallied, as at Penn State, not around the victim, but our guys.
Athletic prowess was, as we saw at Penn State,
glorified above human decency, compassion, respect and the law. But this is
true at most schools. As long as athletes perform they are untouchable.
The root of the problem is the culture of big-time athletics and Greek
life. And it will not be addressed through NCAA sanctions or the removal
of Joe Paternos statue at Penn State. It will end only when fraternities,
sororities and football - along with other professional sports programs
masquerading as college athletics - are banished from colleges and
universities. These athletes, in the end, also are used.
They are unpaid performers, brought to the
campus solely for their athletic prowess, who make millions for their
schools and their coaches. If you have a son or daughter - especially a
daughter - who wants to get an education, look for a school that has
banished these organizations.
The corporate world sees football players, fraternity brothers and sorority
sisters as prime recruits.
They have been conditioned to join the team, to
surrender moral autonomy, to accept and carry out acts of personal
humiliation, to treat with contempt those who oppose them or who are
different, to define their life by an infantile narcissism centered on greed
and self-promotion and to remain silent about crimes they witness or take
part in. It is the very ethic of corporations.
The ruling elite sees in Greek organizations and football programs the
training ground for the amoral class of speculators,
bankers and corporatists who pillage the country.
-
Henry Hank Paulson, who as
secretary of the treasury orchestrated a government payout of more
than $12.9 billion to save AIG and Goldman Sachs (where he had been
the chairman and chief executive officer), was a member of the
fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon and an offensive lineman at
Dartmouth.
-
The billionaire hedge fund manager
Stephen Mandel, who chairs Dartmouths board of trustees, was,
as Rolling Stone points out, in Psi Upsilon.
-
Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of GE,
was a Phi Delt at Dartmouth, as were other trustees including Morgan
Stanley senior adviser R. Bradford Evans, billionaire oilman
Trevor Rees-Jones and venture capitalist William W. Helman
IV.
And that is just Dartmouth.
Hazing is also integral to the military, where suicide - including the
recent suicide of a Chinese-American soldier, Pvt. Danny Chen, in
Afghanistan - is often the result.
It is almost impossible to escape your
tormentors in the military. Suicide becomes for many the only exit. Chen,
who was the sole Asian-American in his unit, endured sandbags being tied to
his arms by fellow soldiers. Rocks and water bottles were thrown at him.
He was forced to speak Chinese instead of
English. And he was taunted with the slurs gook, slant, chink and egg
roll. Eight soldiers are being court-martialed in his death. A huge
percentage of the suicides in the military happen because of hazing. Most of
these cases are never investigated. The bodies are just shipped home.
Corporate culture, which now dominates higher education, shares the
predatory culture of the military.
These cultures are about subsuming the self into
the herd. They are about the acquiring of technical, vocational skills to
serve the system. And with the increasing budget cuts, and more craven
obsequiousness to corporate donors, it will only get worse.
These forces of conformity are hostile to the
humanities that teach students to question assumptions and structures, that
prod them to seek a life of meaning and an ethical code that challenges the
blind, utilitarian obedience to power and profit that corporations and the
military instill.
We will, I fear, continue to turn out the
intellectually stunted and maimed, those who know school football records
but no philosophy, drama, art, music, theology, literature or history.
The goal of an education is not, in
the end, to tell students what to think but to teach them how to think.
College and university administrators defund libraries, close foreign
language and classics departments and invest staggering sums in gargantuan
sports arenas and athletic programs. And the only time the student body
protests or riots is when, as at Penn State, something unpleasant happens to
the beloved football coach. Pity the student who goes there to learn.
The faculty and administration will not help
them; they are complicit or intimidated.
William Carlos Williams, author of the
poem Asphodel,
That Greeny Flower, knew there was more to life than careers,
personal empowerment, the quest for prestige, the roar of the crowd and
networking. But many find this out too late.
And those attending schools like Penn State will
probably never find out at all.
Williams wrote:
It is difficult
to get the news from poems
yet men die miserably every day
for lack
of what is found there.
