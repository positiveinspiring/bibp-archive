The Republic (Greek: Πολιτεία, Politeia) is
a Socratic dialogue, written by Plato around 380 BC, concerning the
definition of justice and the order and character of the just city-state and
the just man.
It is Plato's best-known work and has proven to
be one of the most intellectually and historically influential works of
philosophy and political theory.
In it, Socrates along with various
Athenians and foreigners discuss the meaning of justice and examine whether
or not the just man is happier than the unjust man by considering a series
of different cities coming into existence "in speech", culminating in a city
(Kallipolis) ruled by philosopher-kings; and by examining the nature of
existing regimes.
The participants also discuss,
In The Republic Plato describes four types of
government:
-
monarchy
-
oligarchy
-
tyranny
-
democracy
The
Allegory of the Cave is a discussion on
human mentality and the body politic, our thinking and being.
There are four types of people in the cave,
though nowhere in the text are the characters overtly counted.
In the cave there are the captors and captives.
-
The captives in the cave are controlled
and know nothing in life but the cave, worse they only know one wall
of the cave.
-
The captors use a fire to cast shadows
on the wall the prisoners face to keep them captivated and
distracted by a made up reality. Among the captives there are the
chained and the unchained.
-
The chained are held in place so that
they can only look straight ahead and are convinced of the reality
and moreover importance of the shadows.
-
The unchained are transfixed with the
images and convinced of the reality and moreover the importance of
the shadows to the point they don't need chains. They are held by
shadows, like elephants onto a string.
Both the chained and unchained captives have no
interest in their actual existence as captives in a cave.
They are not conscious, they are not
aware of self or their surroundings, or the captors, they are only aware of
and concerned with the shadows.
The captors hold the captives with shadows, as distractions. There are the
chained captives, the unchained captives and the captors who hold them. The
fourth character in the allegory, the fourth distinct part of the set, is
the freed prisoner.
The freed prisoner, after being in the cave his
whole life, finds himself aboveground and is at first pained by sunlight and
then begins to see.
First he sees only shadows as that is what he is
accustomed to, then reflections, then the objects casting shadows and then
finally the total of his surroundings, himself, others and the stars and the
sun.
The freed prisoner learns about sunlight and the
dependence of all things on it. He learns about the basic tenets of 'reality'
and that the sun is the true light, not the captors' fire.
The freed
prisoner learns about simple conditions of reality and the things which the
captors' shadows represented.
He
becomes conscious and understands his place
in the world.
He realizes
he was deceived his whole life and that
everyone he had ever known from the cave is imprisoned and deceived as well.
And he has to return.
After deliberation the freed prisoner returns and attempts to inform the
captives of their predicament and, by that, free them.
The chained and unchained captives scorn the
freed prisoner for not being able to see in the dark cave, his eyes having
adjusted to daylight. Eventually they want to eliminate the freed prisoner
for revealing their predicament to them, for upsetting the status quo, even
though they are held captive by it.
The
controlling captors of course seek to eliminate him or anyone who
questions and exposes the cave system for what it is.
The three characters being compelled to remove
the fourth distinct type, the freed prisoner, the one who seeks to free the
captives and show them true light as opposed to control in the cave, is
reflective of how controlling institutions operate.
The political and actual representations are easy enough to quantify and the
power of the freed prisoner or righteous rebel is recognizable throughout
the world.
One of the most important layers to the
Allegory of the Cave is that of the personal layer of the cave within -
the caves people make around themselves. The shadows are false evidence
appearing real - fear.
The outside world of fires and shadows often
uses fear to steer, but inside fear is used the same.
A majority of people replay shadows to
themselves to keep the status quo inside so they don't have to face the
reality of inside and outside. They have their own personal caves where
false evidence appearing real controls them.
The freed prisoner, the righteous rebel,
is powerful in the world and can lead us out of our own personal caves
toward enlightenment.
The shadows are very much symbolic of the consensus reality, constantly
being programmed and reinforced by
the mainstream media, which most people
believe to be real.
When we follow our intuition, we often
find ourselves behaving in ways that the conditioned, imprisoned minds of
people around us find impossible to understand.
They have to rationalize' your words and
behavior by saying you are mad', dangerous' or delusional', and may
behave in a patronizing manner towards you.
In fact, you are merely different, viewing
reality from another point of observation. Do what your heart intuitively
tells you, for it is Consciousness speaking - the Silent Voice.
Follow that and the adventure begins...
