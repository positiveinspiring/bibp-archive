The attempt by Hitlery Clinton to score propaganda points over China
by accusing it of internet censorship of Google is a stunning display
of hypocrisy. Google has been distorting its search engine results and page
view counts in order to protect criminal mass murderers who hijacked the US
government.
For example, a colleague of mine made a movie
about 911 called 9-11
Eyewitness, and put it on U-tube.
When the movie got a million hits,
suddenly Google switched the hit count to zero. The only possible
explanation was that they wanted to prevent that video from reaching the
most viewed list.
My own u-tube posting view numbers are also routinely distorted by Google.
For example, my posting about
HAARP as an earthquake weapon reached
240,000 views before it was suddenly reset to 20,000 views. Google also
blacked out a report from a press
conference about 911 held at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.
Any truth seeker putting out information about these mass murderers has had
similar experiences.
Furthermore, Google routinely cuts the amount of links to popular truth
seeker in a clumsy attempt to prevent too many people from finding out the
truth. They make sure CIA approved information appears at the top of
their search results on key subjects.
US government agencies also routinely tamper with my e-mail. I have watched
them delete important unread e-mails from my mail box. They also prevent
many people from contacting me via e-mail. I am sure they do this to lots of
people.
This is far worse behavior than Chinese attempts to deal with
pornographic spam and ethnic tensions.
If the US government wants to take the moral high ground, they must first be
standing on it.
For now, it is a clear case of the pot calling
the kettle black.
