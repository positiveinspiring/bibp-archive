Christine Madeleine Odette Lagarde
Managing Director (MD) of the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF)
To much trumpeting
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) have
kindly agreed to help out desperate and
war torn Ukraine. How wonderful they are we
are all meant to think, but the truth couldn't be more opposite.
The International Monetary Fund was set up in 1945, describing itself as an,
"organization of 188 countries, working to
foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability,
facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable
economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world."
This all sounds very laudable, but in reality
the IMF has a very different purpose from that which is stated. If you look
at the history of the IMF's intervention in countries around the world you
will see a trail of disaster and looting that repeats time and time again
wherever they go.
The many countries that are involved are supposed to have some influence but
this is proportional to their financial clout, which in truth means that the
USA has most of the control of what happens and many countries have
effectively no say at all.
My opinion of the IMF, concurs with that of John Perkins, author of 'Confessions
of An Economic Hitman', his views being that of an insider in the system
and mine merely as an observer.
He succinctly points out that major western
nations use financial warfare to get what they want and gain
influence over other countries - the IMF being one of the tools with which
they do this.

Caribbean countries such as Jamaica have
been destroyed by trade agreements
-
Much the same thing has happened
throughout Africa,
South America and Asia at various
times since world war II
What the IMF does is somewhat similar to a
thug loan shark.
The loan shark lends money to people who can't
afford to borrow so that the borrower ends up having to not eat to make the
payments or face having broken legs.
In a more subtle way, the IMF behaves in a similar way.
Countries are given a 'helping hand' as loans
that they will have great difficulty paying back. In return for the loans
the IMF wants interest and regular repayments and 'restructuring' of the
country's assets.
What this actually means is the asset stripping
of sovereign nations so that their economic wealth is transferred from the
country's/public's ownership into private hands.
This has happened in Europe recently, with countries such as,
-
Greece
-
Portugal
-
Ireland
-
Spain
-
Italy,
...faced with the prospect of having to sell off
national assets in order to finance repayment of loans to either the IMF or
EU.
Private consortiums,
owned by the banks or
oligarchs buy up a nation's forests, coal industry, water supply etc so
that instead of the country receiving income from its recourses the private
company makes all the money off the backs of the increasingly impoverished
population.
At the moment the Ukrainian people might welcome the IMF but you can be sure
that in a short time the country will be financially raped and the
population plunged into even worse poverty as a result of IMF 'assistance'.
Here in Ireland we are realizing the foolishness
of the IMF/EU bailouts that is making life increasingly difficult for
ordinary citizens while the government ponders selling off our resources.
Any country with sense (like
Iceland) would show the IMF the door and find a better way of
clawing its way out of economic problems. Iceland is a perfect example of
how a country could solve its own problems - but no-one
in the media talks about this - the
corporatocracy does not want anyone else getting the same idea.
Surely, if every nation took the same actions
the corporate take over of sovereign nations would fall flat on its face
wouldn't it?
