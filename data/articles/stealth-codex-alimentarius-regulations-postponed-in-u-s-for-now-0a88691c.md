The recently shelved New Dietary
Ingredient (NDI)
draft guidelines proposed by the FDA has been the subject of much
concern by natural health supplement manufacturers and consumers ever
since the announcement was made by the agency in early 2011.
The guidelines, which were
published in the Federal Register, would have clarified some definitions
of terms, changed requirements for new supplement introduction and
manufacture, and a host of other more minor, but important, tweaks in
previous FDA policy.
However, the most concerning aspect of the
proposed changes is that many are actually the stealthy introduction of
Codex Alimentarius-compliant regulations being imposed upon the United
States health supplement industry.
Specifically, these guidelines would not
only have made it harder and more expensive for vitamin and mineral
supplement manufacturers to introduce new supplements into the market,
but it would also have resulted in the removal of many supplements from
the market as it currently exists.
Most notably, the proposed
FDA guidelines mandated the use of Risk Assessment methodology to
determine and establish what could be easily described as the Maximum
Upper Limit or Maximum Permitted Level of nutrients allowed
in vitamin and mineral supplements - a hallmark of
the Codex Alimentarius position in
relation to these products.
If one is unfamiliar with Codex Alimentarius
and the ramifications that the standards of this international
organization will have on vitamin and mineral supplements in the United
States (and every other nation), I encourage you to read
Codex Alimentarius - The End of Health Freedom, which is a
comprehensive study of Codex Alimentarius and the fallout of adherence
to the standards it sets.
In this context, it is extremely important
to understand the deleterious effects of using Risk Assessment
methodology in evaluating food supplements as well as establishing
Maximum Upper Limits/Maximum Permitted Levels of nutrition in these
products.
Essentially, Codex Alimentarius derives its
standards (which are set extremely low) by classifying
nutrients as toxins even while
classifying actual
toxins such as fluoride as nutrients.
It is also important to understand that it
is the goal of every nation that is part of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) to become Codex-compliant for trade dispute purposes.
Thus, it is easy to see why regulatory
agencies such as the FDA, USDA,
and EPA (which openly desires to become Codex compliant) introduce
Codex guidelines through stealth and under the appearance of their own
independent regulatory standards and volition.
As I wrote in my article, The
Language of Health Tyranny - Decoding the Codex Alimentarius Guidelines
For Vitamins and Supplements,
Risk assessment, while seemingly benign, is
actually crucial to the ability of Codex to justify the ban of vitamin
and mineral supplements.
This concept works on the assumption that
the item being tested is inherently dangerous and toxic. This method is
completely the opposite of what should be used when evaluating vitamins
and minerals.
As Dr. Rima Laibow states in her article "'Nutraceuticide'
and Codex Alimentarius:"
This use of risk assessment, of course,
represents a major deflection from the real use and value of risk
assessment, which is to make sure that people are not exposed to the
dangerous industrial chemicals that have serious and sometimes
lethal effects on them and their children.[1]
By applying scientific risk assessment to
nutrients and supplements, they are essentially considering them toxins
as they are lumped into the same category as chemicals and poisons.
There is no need to explicitly state that
nutrients are toxins. This is done by default. So, in the end, we have
the categorization of vitamins and minerals that are essential to human
health and life as something that is actually toxic. In this sense, we
are entering the world of doublethink.
Regardless, this is the position of Codex,
as well as the position of the U.S. Delegation throughout the discussion
[Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods For Special Dietary Uses].[2]
Indeed, even many alleged health freedom
International Non-Governmental Organizations were either gullible enough
to be taken in by the promise of the benefits of risk assessment, or
morally bankrupt enough to be bought off by the pharmaceutical industry
or others who might benefit from the demise of the natural supplement
industry.[3]
Yet, some of the support for risk assessment
methods early on seems to have been based on the fear of the
implementation of maximum limits proposed by European countries like
France.
These limits would have reduced the potency
level of each pill to no more than 15% Recommended Daily Intake (RDI), a
figure that is already set much too low.
Yet those who favored risk assessment seemed
to jump from the frying pan into the fire. As Scott Tips of the Natural
Health Federation writes:
The so-called 'science-based risk
assessment' for establishing Safe Upper Limits (maximum levels) for
vitamin-and-mineral potencies, to which the EU has agreed, and about
which the Americans are as happy as flies on cow dung, is nothing
but a trap.
The Americans think that they will
be able to get real science to establish high maximum levels for
their vitamins and minerals and then sell them to European consumers
by the bushels.
But by the time the Europeans get
through applying their science, those maximum limits will be so low
toddlers would be lucky to get any nutritional value out of
Codex-harmonized vitamins and minerals. The European Unions
Scientific Committee on Food has already started using its
science-based risk assessment to establish laughably low maximum
limits for European vitamins.
And, lately, I have begun to see a
growing concern, if not outright fear, in the faces of some
science-based risk-assessment proponents that perhaps things might
not go their way here after all.[4]
With this in mind, the FDAs NDI draft
guidance document would have required the supplement manufacturer to
include an NDI notification for the new ingredient.
Among the requirements of the notification
is the establishment of a No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL)
as well as the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)
for the ingredient.
While the ADIs present their own controversy
(always being set too low), the NOAEL is, in fact, simply another name
for Maximum Upper Limits/Upper Safe Levels - a level which affects the
actual production and consumption of the supplement as opposed to the
instructional element.
These levels, while seemingly benign or even
positive constructions, are far from helpful when applied to nutritional
supplements.
To give an idea of how these Risk Assessment
numbers are improperly applied and then ratcheted down until the
supplements are rendered virtually useless, Rima Laibow describes
[5] the Risk Assessment methodology as follows:
First a group of test animals, mice, rats,
rabbits, et cetera, are increasing amounts of the toxin of interest.
The dose in increased until half of the
animals are dead. The dose at which 50 percent of the test animals die
is called the Lethal Dose 50 (LD50). A similar dose is
extrapolated for humans.
Next, the other end of the dose spectrum is
investigated by giving test animals smaller and smaller doses until no
impact can be identified from the dose of the toxin to establish the
Maximum Upper Limit (MUL).
The MUL is divided by a safety factor,
typically 100.
The dosage that results is called the
Maximum Permissible Upper Limit.[6]
When the toxin is actually a nutrient,
setting the MUL at a point where there is no impact is defeated the
purpose of consuming the nutrient in the first place, as well as the
precursor to significantly raising the costs and practicality of
obtaining proper nutrition.
Thus, the FDAs draft NDI guidelines as
previously submitted were infested with Codex Alimentarius-based
guidelines of Risk Assessment and Maximum Upper Limits/Upper Safe
Levels designed to reduce access and availability of
nutritional supplements both from the shelves and the factory.
Of course, these specific guidelines were
not the only way in which the FDA had attempted to impede the
development and production of nutritional supplements.
The NDI guidelines also attempted to make
NDI submission supplement-specific as opposed to ingredient-specific.
This means that the agency would have
required a
new NDI notification for each specific supplement, formula, or blend
in which the NDI is used, instead of simply the NDI itself. That is,
unless the manufacturer is able to meet some rather strict criteria
which, among other things, conveniently reduce the amount of the NDI in
the supplement.
Certain types of probiotics would also have
been restricted given the FDAs attempt to exclude the designation of
the bacteria supplement as being a dietary ingredient - thus potentially
removing certain amounts of probiotics from the market.
Thankfully, for the time being, the FDAs
guidelines have been postponed after significant
public outcry and a meeting with a handful of senators and
representatives in the U.S. Congress.
However, the guidelines will be revisited in
the future and one can only guess as to what they may include when the
updated versions are released to the public.
Keeping history in perspective, it is an
unfortunate reality that government revisions often make the original
bill seem better in retrospect. This is because they can count on the
second round of opposition to only be half the size of the first.
Thus, after a bit of rewriting and
rewording, the new version of the bill or policy often includes elements
which were even worse than the first version due to the fractured
resistance it will now encounter.
While reporting on guidelines that have been
shelved may, at first, seem like a waste of time, it is important to
point out just how the FDA, along with its regulatory kin, are
determined to harmonize their own standards with that of Codex
Alimentarius to the detriment of the consumer and the American people
they have been tasked with protecting.
We must be able to recognize these dangers
immediately and identify the sources of such changes to regulatory
policy in order to mount an effective resistance.
