Add Facebook depression to potential harms
linked with social media, an influential doctors group warns, referring to
a condition it says may affect troubled teens who obsess over the online
site.
A NEW CONDITION?
Researchers disagree on whether its simply an extension of depression some
kids feel in other circumstances, or a distinct condition linked with using
the online site.
But there are unique
aspects of Facebook that can make it a particularly
tough social landscape to navigate for kids already dealing with poor
self-esteem, said Dr.
Gwenn OKeeffe, a Boston-area pediatrician and lead
author of new
American Academy of Pediatrics social media guidelines.
WBZ-TVs Kate Merrill reports.
With in-your-face friends tallies, status updates and photos of
happy-looking people having great times, Facebook pages can make some kids
feel even worse if they think they dont measure up.
SKEWED VIEW OF LIFE
It can be more painful than sitting alone in a crowded school cafeteria or
other real-life encounters that can make kids feel down, OKeeffe said,
because Facebook provides a skewed view of whats really going on.
Online,
theres no way to see facial expressions or read body language that provide
context.
The guidelines urge pediatricians to encourage parents to talk with their
kids about online use and to be aware of Facebook depression, cyberbullying,
sexting and other online risks.
They were published online Monday in Pediatrics.
ITS LIKE A BIG
POPULARITY CONTEST
Abby Abolt, 16, a Chicago high school sophomore and frequent Facebook user,
says the site has never made her feel depressed, but that she can understand
how it might affect some kids.
If you really didnt have that many friends and werent really doing much
with your life, and saw other peoples status updates and pictures and what
they were doing with friends, I could see how that would make them upset,
she said.
Its like a big popularity contest - who can get the most friend requests
or get the most pictures tagged, she said.
Also, its common among some teens to post snotty or judgmental messages on
the Facebook walls of people they dont like, said Gaby Navarro, 18, a
senior from Grayslake, Ill. Its happened to her friends, and she said she
could imagine how that could make some teens feel depressed.
Parents should definitely know about these practices, Navarro said. Its
good to raise awareness about it.
The academy guidelines note that online harassment can cause profound
psychosocial outcomes, including suicide.
The
widely publicized suicide of
a 15-year-old Massachusetts girl last year occurred after shed been bullied
and harassed, in person and on Facebook.
Facebook is where all the teens are hanging out now. Its their corner
store, OKeeffe said.
She said the benefits of kids using social media sites like Facebook
shouldnt be overlooked, however, such as connecting with friends and
family, sharing pictures and exchanging ideas.
IT CAN GO TOO FAR
A lot of whats happening is actually very healthy, but it can go too far,
she said.
Dr. Megan Moreno, a University of Wisconsin adolescent medicine specialist
who has studied online social networking among college students, said using
Facebook can enhance feelings of social connectedness among well-adjusted
kids, and have the opposite effect on those prone to depression.
Parents shouldnt get the idea that using Facebook,
is going to somehow
infect their kids with depression, she said.
