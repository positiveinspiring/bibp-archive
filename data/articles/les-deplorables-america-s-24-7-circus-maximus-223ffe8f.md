# Les Deplorables - America's 24/7 Circus Maximus

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_americanempire176.htm

For the basket of deplorables,
and even beyond their circle, the temptation is immense to
equate voting for Donald Trump with raising a finger against
the establishment.
Ultra-savvy at playing mainstream media for invaluable free
publicity, elevating Outrageousness to an art form and being
impervious to irony and derision,
Trump
has been a master at tapping wave after wave of
anger against the new liberal elite - including a
nomenklatura of crypto-intellectual Ivy league-educated
"experts" who could not give a damn about understanding the
(real world) consequences of United States Government
(USG) policies.
The anger is manifested by
declassified blue collars, the unemployed, the functionally
illiterate, white trash. Whatever you call them, they are
the excluded form the Neoliberal Banquet, not only
economically but also culturally.
But this being Trump, a master
of self-promotion, the
battle is more like Ego against The Establishment.
And it gets juicier when we
learn from powerful, discreet New York-based interests -
supporters of Trump's platform - about who's really winning:
"The Trump campaign is
hardly spending any money at all and holding all over.
They may use their money in
the last month after the debates if Hillary recovers for
those debates from what appears to be an attack of
Parkinson's.
He has a shot though no
matter who wins I predict,
-
there will be peace
with Russia
-
the oil price will
rise
-
imports from Asia of
military parts will be repatriated
-
rigging of
currencies is over
-
there will be
offsetting measures to stop the flood of
immigrants and products under mis-valued
currencies
The masters do not
lose."
The "masters" are of course the
Masters of the Universe who really run the USG.
And here's the clincher on how's
in control:
"Both sides are controlled
and that explains everything.
Lenin said that the way to
defeat our opponents is to take over their leadership of
the opponent. Look at the Moral Majority which Jerry
Falwell disbanded when it became too powerful. Look at
Ross Perot who exited when he started making a real
dent. Both were taken care of and Ross made money out of
it."
"Their internal lingo for it
is the concept of 'dynamic silence'. This is a technique
by the masters to block out all news coverage of
let's say a Nazi so that he could gain no following.
That they could have done to
Trump if he were not theirs. Who could have complained?
He was just an apolitical real estate operator that no
one was interested in."
"So what do we have in the
end? An entertaining gladiatorial contest that they
control both sides of and the winner gets all the money
- as with the Clinton Foundation.
And the public is no
wiser..."
The 24/7
Circus Maximus
There are subtle gradations to
this scenario.
Rothschild interests are
not supporting Trump, according to these well-connected
sources, because Trump has not been anointed by the club and
is thus unreliable.
They recall, for instance, how,
"Greenspan was so
incompetent that Wall Street leaders had to give him
trades so he could make money before they put him as the
head of
Federal Reserve.
Then he was so out of it
that they had to direct his every move as he had no
comprehension what they do."
"They", of course, meaning
Rothschild interests.
On the Cold War 2.0 front,
things are even hazier. Since 2010, when
Obama
was ordered to keep the US nuclear first-strike
strategy, Russia and China know where this is heading.
It's no wonder Trump is being
relentlessly attacked as Putin's own Trojan Horse -
because he's against Cold War 2.0 and the demonization
of Russia.
But the Pentagon's strident
Ash Carter, soon out of a job, is one thing.
Another thing entirely is
what the Masters of the Universe really want,
according to these Trump-supporting sources:
"Hillary would be
following Trump's guidelines should she win, as the
US military will explain to her that she has no
other options based on Russian military superiority
in submarines, and defensive and offensive missiles.
Trump's policies are
wise."
There's even a P.R. move that
could literally devastate the already wobbly Hillary
campaign:
"Hillary's reckless threats
against Russia, risking nuclear war, could bring back
the Lyndon Johnson TV ads against Goldwater by Donald
Trump, where we had a little child in a meadow picking
flowers while a nuclear bomb goes off.
It was an ad of genius and
destroyed Goldwater. The first strike nuclear attack
policy and the reckless provocations combine to form an
excellent Johnson style ad.
This time Trump can use it
against the Democrats, who have created almost
all the wars in the last 125 years."
The daisy cutter ad is
here.
A Force for
Farce?
Even considering that
virtually the whole US establishment - from the
Beltway nomenklatura to
Wall Street - is arrayed against him, the jury is still
out on whether Trump is a real threat to their
interests.
Because Trump could also be the perfect Trojan Horse.
Evidence relies for instance on his appointment of
perfect insiders Larry Kudlow and Steven Moore
as his senior economic advisors.
That's the Trump as a
Force for Farce scenario. So "dynamic silence" seems
to be the rule.
Here's how dynamic
silence works;
"If you oppose those
above the President, the news media blacks you out
and the masses do not hear anything, so how can they
be stirred up?
Donald is an insider and
he represents the military industrial complex
including the CIA, DIA, etc. They will deny it, of
course, so they have deniability and he can say he
is against the establishment when he is an insider."
"That is the first line
of defense.
If you manage to
outsmart them, then they characterize you as a nut.
That is the second line of defense. Now, if you
persist in making them uncomfortable, then you end
up as William Colby, Vince Forster or Jack Kennedy.
Richard Nixon was ousted
and he went quietly so that, to quote Tricky Dick,
'I am not going to end up as Jack' as he went out
the back door of the White House."
"The key here is Donald
is receiving more publicity than Hillary, and by
attacking him for being an America Firster his polls
have risen dramatically. The public loves it so the
Masters of the Universe are helping him.
The military industries
have to be repatriated as we no longer control the
seas and this will require either currency
adjustments or tariffs.
Hence, Donald's correct
calls for an end to currency rigging which had as
part of their purpose the building up of Germany and
Japan at the sacrifice of our industries. Absurd
that we did that but that is how it was.
That is ending now with
Donald and the emergency situation of lack of
control of the Pacific Ocean for the component
transportation by sea for our military production.
Japan and Germany will be cut loose."
"Brzezinski
said that if any opponent leaps ahead of the United
States militarily, the US ceases to be a global
power. That is the case and the military knows it.
And Trump knows it or he
would not have said that much. They need a crash
program to catch up.
That costs big money. It
will probably require force and base reductions and
an increase in technological expenditure in a
massive way. That is what the Russians did.
They can obtain this
from massively reducing the welfare transfers on
illegal immigrants.
That is what Donald is
committed to."
If this analysis is correct,
it ties in with Trump's push to organize an immediate
rapprochement with Russia in case he's elected, so the
US industrial-military-surveillance complex can catch up
and at least try to remedy the danger of losing the
next war Hillary and her own neocon bag of deplorables
are so bullish on.
As we approach the first
cage match, the jury is still out on whether the
Queen of War may lose
the election because millennials absolutely detest
her, because the "basket of deplorables" absolutely
detests her, or both.
But one thing seems to be certain in the whole
Les Deplorables saga - at least for those
Masters of the Universe-connected sources - who
the real winner will be.
So let's give them the
last word, for now:
"It will be very
difficult for Hillary to beat Trump in a debate
as he is quick on his feet and will take no
prisoners.
Let me say this. If
Hillary were to win, and we don't think she
will, she will do what she is told and follow
the same policies as Trump would."
