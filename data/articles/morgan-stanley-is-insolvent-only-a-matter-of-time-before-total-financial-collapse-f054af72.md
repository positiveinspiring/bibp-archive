The fall of the House of Morgan has begun as
stock prices on the global market at
Morgan Stanley (MS) begin to fall on the
New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
According to
Rick Wiles:
Im
hearing rumors that another major financial house is going to implode. In
fact, the name Ive been given is Morgan Stanley . . . Its going to be put
on the sacrificial alter by the financial elite.
MS, technically speaking, is classified as
insolvent based on mark-to-market valuation.
By selling off non-core
assets, MS has been
able to reduce its European exposure through the manipulation of hedge
funds and allocation of funds to failing financial corporations.
Some
mainstream media outlets tout that the Federal Reserve Bank will come in and
assist MS in their insolvency and that MS,
just isnt going out of business
anytime soon.
However, on the bond market, MS is being
treated like a junk-rated company. Moodys the rating agency that
sells their ratings to whomever will pay for a triple A score, have
announced they will downgradge MS ratings which would put all US banks at
risk.
Otis Caset, director of credit research at
Markit confirms:
What has driven that, obviously, is Europe. The perception
is - correctly or incorrectly - that Morgan Stanley is one of the U.S. banks
most exposed to Europes problems.
In 2008, with the first
pre-meditated financial explosion, the cause for the bailout of the
banks was a large sum of cash needed quickly to repay China who had
purchased large quantities of mortgage-backed securities that went belly-up
when the global scam was realized.
When China realized that they had been
duped into buying worthless securitized loans which would never be repaid,
they demanded the actual property instead.
The Chinese were prepared to send
their people to American shores to seize property as allocated to them
through the securitized loan contracts. To stave this off, the American taxpayers were
coerced by former President
Bush and former US Treasury Secretary
Hank
Paulson.
During that incident, the US Senate was told emphatically that they
had to approve a $700
billion bailout (below video) or else
martial law would be implemented immediately.
That money was funneled through
the Federal Reserve Bank and wired to China,
as well as other countries that were demanding repayment for the fraudulent
securitizations.
To further avert financial catastrophe, as well
as more debt or property seizure threats by the Chinese, the Euro was
imploded there by plunging most of the European countries into an
insurmountable free-fall for which they were never intended to recover.
MS exposure to mortgage-backed securities and
derivatives fraud may have finally brought the financial implosion to
America. As Otis points out, it is the exposure to the Eurozone that was the
nail in the coffin at MS. This only furthers the fact that financial
collapse is imminent in America and the repercussions are already laid out.
However, this planned implosion of the
mega-banks only serves to fit the global Elites plans.
John Paulson recently
traded in his stocks for 4.53 million shares in SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)
while investing deeper into NovaGold Resources.
George Soros has also
sold his shares and interest in,
-
JPMorgan (701,400 shares)
-
Goldman Sachs
(120,000 shares)
-
Citigroup (420,000)
He has reallocated these funds to
gold.
The insolvency of MS means that the customer funds that are held in MS can
be hypothecated (or co-mingled) by the bank into their funds to be used to
pay off any loans or debts owed by the bank.
Earlier this month, on August 9th, the 7th
Circuit Court of Appeals (CCA)
ruled that BNYM can be moved to first in line of creditors over the
customers that had their funds stolen by Sentinel Management Group (SMG).
Before SMG collapsed in 2007, Eric Bloom, former
chief executive, and Charles Mosely, head trader of SMG stole $500 million
in customer secured funds and were
indicted because they exposed customer segregated funds to highly risky
derivatives.
The SMG ruling
means that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SPIC) regulatory systems will
not insure customer funds, investments, depositors and retirees who hold
accounts in banks.
In fact, the banking institution is now legally
allowed to use those customer funds deposited as collateral, payment on
debts for loans made, or free use on the stock market to purchase
investments as the bank sees fit.
When a customer deposits money into a bank, the
bank issues a
promise to have those funds available when the customer returns to
withdraw the deposited amount.
With the SMG ruling, those funds become property
of the bank once they are deposited. If the bank is insolvent, under duress
or filed bankruptcy, those customer deposited funds can be co-mingled with
the banks funds and used for the purposes of the bank without recourse to
the customer.
As explained in
Readiness Exercise 1984
(Rex84) the end of the US dollar combined with civil unrest would cause the
US government to declare martial law in order to preserve continuity of
government.
Since 2010, all the mega-banks in the US have
filed
resolution plans with
the Fed
describing how to liquidate banking assets without causing further
damage to a failing financial system. By selling non-core assets without
upsetting shareholders while protecting the monetary system, taxpayers and
creditors is the work of the mega-banks who have contributed solely to the
destruction of the global financial markets.
Both Bank of America and Citibank have already
begun liquidity with the sale of their non-core assets proving that these
two financial institutions are insolvent. Add to this list MS.
While mega-banks are unloading their assets
under duress, they are
acquiring smaller banks and keeping their names to fool the American
public into thinking they are banking with an independent as they
consolidate financial power in the US.
In response to the coming implosion,
the Federal
Reserve Bank is inventing electronic fiat. This keeps the Ponzi scheme
going.
On the surface it all appears to ok. However, undercover and out of
the general publics sight, the manipulation of insurance rates, market
values, mortgages are directly contributing to the complete banking system
collapse.
An estimated 70% of some of the mega-banks
worth is provided by the government by subsidies; meaning that without the
money provided by the US government, these banks would go under tomorrow.
And by watching the financial climate as it is emerging, it appears that we
are witnessing just that.
Combined with the
solicitations of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for,
...it is clear that
this insolvency of MS is one more proof that
martial law coinciding with financial collapse is dangerously close.
