The worst selloff in emerging-market currencies
in five years is beginning to reveal the extent of the fallout from
the
Federal Reserve's tapering of monetary stimulus, compounded by
political and
financial instability.
The Turkish lira plunged to a record and South
Africa's rand fell yesterday to a level weaker than 11 per dollar for the
first time since 2008. Argentine policy makers devalued the peso by reducing
support in the foreign-exchange market, allowing the currency to drop the
most in 12 years to an unprecedented low.
Investors are losing confidence in some of the
biggest developing nations, extending the currency-market rout triggered
last year when the FED first signaled it would scale back stimulus.
While Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
Africa were the engines of global growth following the
financial crisis in
2008, emerging markets now pose a threat to world financial stability.
"The current environment is potentially very
toxic for emerging markets," Eamon Aghdasi, a strategist at Societe
Generale SA in New York, said in a phone interview yesterday.
"You have two very troubling things:
uncertainty about the FED policy, combined with concerns about growth,
particularly in China. It's difficult to justify that it's time to go
out and buy emerging markets at the moment."
Global Declines
Developing-nation currencies sold off after a
report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics indicated yesterday that
China's manufacturing may
contract for the first time in six months,
adding to concern that growth is
losing momentum.
The declines were part of a broader slide in
global markets today, with stocks in Asia, Europe and the U.S. tumbling.
Yields on 10-year German bunds slipped to an 11-week low, while the yen,
considered by investors as a haven, rose versus all 16 major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg.
Currencies of commodity-exporting countries that
depend on Chinese demand sank, with the rand plunging 0.9 percent, following
yesterday's 1.1 percent decline. Brazil's real fell 0.1 percent while
Chile's peso sank 0.3 percent after decreasing 1.2 percent yesterday.
Argentina's peso fell 12 percent yesterday,
marking its biggest decline since a devaluation in 2002. It sank an
additional 1.5 percent today to 8.0014 per dollar.
The central bank pared dollar sales aimed at
propping up the peso to preserve international reserves that have fallen to
a seven-year low. Today the central bank said it would lift two-year-old
currency controls and allow the purchase of dollars for savings starting
next week.
The peso traded at around 13 per dollar in the
black market yesterday.
Venezuela Reserves
In Venezuela, the government devalued its
currency for airline tickets and incoming foreign direct investment on Jan.
22. International reserves are at a 10-year low.
The Turkish central bank's first unscheduled
intervention in more than two years wasn't
enough to stop the lira from setting a record low today. Investors are
speculating the central bank's efforts to prop up the lira by burning
through foreign-exchange reserves will prove futile without raising interest
rates.
The lira plunged to a record 2.336 per dollar
and also declined to an all-time intraday low of 3.2069 per euro. Turkey's
central bank refrained from raising benchmark rates this week, fueling
concern that it will be difficult to finance current-account deficits.
Turkey holds about $33 billion in foreign
reserves, excluding deposits from commercial banks, only enough to cover 1
1/2 months of imports, according to Citigroup Inc.
Bad Storm'
"It's a bad storm," Neil Azous, the founder
of Rareview Macro LLC, a Stamford, Connecticut-based advisory and
research firm, said in a phone interview yesterday.
"Their net foreign-exchange reserves are
dwindling pretty fast. They're definitely in the danger zone. If you're
a money manager, the responsible action is to take some measures to
reduce risk."
The
International Monetary Fund predicts that
the growth advantage of emerging markets over advanced economies will shrink
this year to the smallest since 2001.
The Washington-based group kept its expansion
forecast for developing countries this year at 5.1 percent on Jan. 21, while
raising the outlook for advanced economies to 2.2 percent, from the 2
percent estimated in October.
China is struggling to contain $4.8 trillion in
shadow-banking debt, raising concern about the growth outlook for a country
that buys everything from Chile's copper to Brazil's iron ore.
A corruption investigation is embroiling Turkish
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's cabinet, while deadly protests
in Ukraine and Thailand are eroding confidence in the political stability of
developing nations.
Gradual Erosion'
A Bloomberg customized gauge
tracking 20 emerging-market currencies fell 0.4 percent to 89.8 today, the
lowest level since April 2009.
The index has tumbled 9.7 percent over the past
12 months, bigger than any annual decline since it slid 15 percent in 2008.
Fatal Protests
Ukraine's hryvnia has slumped as Parliament
planned to hold an emergency session after anti-government protests led to
fatalities this week. The currency fell as low as 8.48 per dollar, the
weakest since 2009, before reversing losses to gain 0.1 to 8.435 per dollar.
South Africa's rand tumbled as much as 1.8
percent to 11.1949 per dollar today on concern a strike at the world's
biggest platinum mines would dent the country's exports.
The selloff in emerging-market currencies
started in May, when the FED signaled it may pare the monthly asset
purchases that had helped fuel investment in developing nations.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries rose in response.
"In an environment of rising U.S. rates, the
market is quickly finding out who has been swimming naked," Dirk Willer,
a Latin America strategist at Citigroup, the second-largest currency
trader, wrote in a client note.
He said it's "not unreasonable" for the
Argentine peso to fall to 14 per dollar.
Buying Opportunities
The recent weakness has created buying
opportunities for some emerging markets with stronger economic prospects,
according to Marcela Meirelles, a Latin America sovereign strategist
at TCW Group Inc.
"This selloff will create eventually good
buying opportunities of those EM credits with strong fundamentals and
there is still no shortage of them around the world," Meirelles said in
an e-mailed reply to questions.
HSBC recommends clients buy the Mexican peso
against the Chilean peso, saying Mexico's currency will benefit from
expansion in the U.S. as efforts to open up the energy industry to outside
investment boost its southern neighbor's long-term growth potential.
While differentiation is important, the end of
China's "investment and export boom" may still put emerging-market
currencies on a declining trend, according to Morgan Stanley.
"We continue to see the risks surrounding
China's macro trajectory as having a negative impact on EM," Rashique
Rahman, the New York-based co-head of foreign-exchange and
emerging-market strategy at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note yesterday.
"As capital costs rise and investment slows,
commodity prices should come under pressure, boding poorly for economies
linked to China's old growth model."
Brazil's Real
Morgan Stanley has a "reduce" rating on
emerging-market currencies, while recommending selling the Russian ruble
against the dollar.
Brazil's real fell to a five-month low of 2.4327
per dollar today and has lost 28 percent over the past two years.
Brazil should return to the policies of former
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to boost growth, tame rising
consumer prices and attract foreign investment, Pacific Investment
Management Co. said yesterday.
"Valuations are attractive, but unless an
effective policy mix is restored, the outlook for order in Brazil's
financial markets is less certain," Michael Gomez, the co-head of
emerging markets, said in a report published on the fund's website
yesterday.
Pimco Chief Investment Officer Bill Gross
said last week that Brazil was no longer a preferred market.
The comment came more than a decade after the
firm bought the country's bonds as they plunged before presidential
elections in 2002, a bet that proved prescient.
"The market is punishing those countries
with bad policies and politics,"
Bhanu Baweja, the head of emerging-market cross-asset strategy at
UBS AG, said by phone from London.
"There isn't panic, but we are not finished
yet. There's no reason to buy emerging for now."
