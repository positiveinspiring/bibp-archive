The powers of financial capitalism
had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world
system of financial control in private hands able to dominate
the political system of each country and the economy of the
world as a whole.
This system was to be controlled in
a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in
concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings
and conferences
Professor Carroll Quigley
Mentor to President Bill
Clinton
Very soon, America will be forced into water wars in order to secure the
precious asset of water for our people.
This will force our people into more wars of
occupation in a search for water. Meanwhile, every nation that America
conquers, is one less country that the bankers have to worry about taking
over. At the end of the day, if America wants water, someday, Americans will
have to go to war to obtain water.
As any aware person knows,
Agenda 21 is being used as a front for the
purpose of increasing the bottom of line of select global corporations.
Bolivia is being exploited to this end and is serving as the canary in the
mine with regard to what lies ahead for the United States and the coming
water wars.
The United States sits upon a fiscal cliff. Economic devastation is in the
cards for the US. Many wonder what will happen when the country defaults and
cannot pay its bills. The answer is simple, our country will enter
receivership.
Once receivership is thrust upon our country,
the bankers will begin to take control of our assets. Among the prize assets
coveted by the globalist bankers will be our water supply. Soon, very soon,
our water supplies will become the most expensive in the world. Obtaining
water for many Americans will soon be a life and death struggle.
Global consumption of water is doubling every 20 years, more than twice the
rate of human population growth (United Nations Development Program, 2007).
Also, according to the United Nations, more than one billion people already
lack access to fresh drinking water (United Nations Developmental Program,
2007).
If the current trend continues, by 2025 the
demand for fresh water is expected to rise by over 50% more than the amount
of water that is currently available.
Multinational corporations recognize these
trends and are trying to monopolize water supplies around the world.
Monsanto, Bechtel, and other global multinationals are seeking control of
world water systems and supplies. The World Bank recently adopted a policy
of water privatization and full-cost water pricing.
The World Banks policy of privatizing the
worlds water supply conveniently coincides with
the United Nations Agenda 21.
Agenda 21 is actively promoting the
privatization for the worlds water supplies through a water for profit
scheme.
(i) At the lowest appropriate level,
delegation of water resources management, generally, to such a level, in
accordance with national legislation, including decentralization of
government services to local authorities, private enterprises and
communities
(United Nations Environment Program,
2007).
Agenda 21 further addresses the looming water
crisis in Chapter 18 (.35) which states that,
water is a unitary resource. Long-term
development of global freshwater requires holistic management of
resources and a recognition of the interconnectedness of the elements
related to freshwater and freshwater quality.
There are few regions of the world that are
still exempt from problems of loss of potential sources of freshwater
supply, degraded water quality and pollution of surface and groundwater
sources
(The United Nations Department of
Economic and Social Affairs, 2007)
After reading the comforting manner in which
Agenda 21 addresses the coming water crisis, we should all be able to sleep
soundly at night.
Unfortunately, this does not prove to be the
case when one considers what has happened to Bolivia s indigenous peoples
access to fresh water.
Agenda 21s strategy for privatizing the worlds
water is quite simple:
The United Nations financial partner, the
World Bank, and its associated set of central banks around the planet,
cripples a nations economy, largely through the use of fiat currency
and forced assumption of bankers derivative debt.
Subsequently, the World Bank attempts to
resuscitate that nations economy through a series of regime saving loans.
World Bank loans offer the hope of staving off
massive human suffering resulting from a lack of basic necessities,
staggering unemployment and all the other accompanying variables which could
lead to a violent overthrow of a nations political power structure.
However, the terms of a typical World Bank loan would make the most adept
loan shark green with envy.
Often, as a precondition to receiving the loan,
the World Bank imposes some very draconian conditions, such as the
privatization of the basic necessities of life (e.g. water) from which their
corporate partners derive great economic benefit.
Nowhere has this scheme been played out more directly than in the late
1990s and the early 2000s in Bolivia.
The first large scale, dry run of Agenda 21s
plan to privatize water, took place in Bolivia when someone at the World
Bank flipped a switch and demanded the privatization of Bolivia s water
supplies as a precondition for massive debt relief.
In 1995, the government of Bolivia owned nothing. However, Bolivia did owe
the World Bank enormous sums of money. Like a heroin addict, the Bolivian
government became dependent on its financial drug dealer, the World Bank.
Predictably, repaying Bolivian debt, to the World Bank, was plunging the
Bolivian people and its government into the abyss of abject poverty and
despair (Watson, 2003).
In Cochabamba, Bolivia , a city of 800,000 people, the public water system
of El Alto and its neighbor La Paz , the nations capital, was privatized in
1997.
In a classic conflict of interest case, the
private consortium that took control of the water, Aguas del Illimani, is a
subsidiary of Bechtel, and a set of minority shareholders that includes,
among others, an arm of the World Bank (Watson, 2003). Within weeks of
taking over the citys public water company, Bechtel hiked up rates by as
much as 200%, far beyond what the citys poor could afford to pay.
The Bolivian poor, with a lack of access to
clean water, have nearly one in ten children die before they reach the age
of five. Adding insult to injury, families living in El Altos outskirts
rely on well water in which community representatives say are contaminated
with industrial waste (Watson, 2003).
When all legitimate avenues of securing fresh water were blocked by Bechtel,
including the prohibition of collecting rain water in homemade pots and
pans, the Bolivian people took to the streets and an ongoing pattern of
street violence ensued until Bechtel exercised the better half of discretion
and exited the country.
Mark my words, when we do this in America,
follow our coming contrived water shortage, Americans will be met with
44,000 drones and DARPA killer robots.
Bolivias past is Americas future. Why the American people have only heard
a whimper about these corporate abuses at the hands of the San Francisco
based Bechtel Corporation, the World Bank and the United Nations Agenda 21.
In order to answer that question, one has to ask: Who is Bechtel owned by?
Bechtel is a subsidiary of General Electric. General Electric owns NBC
(Media Owners.com, 2005).
Perhaps this is why the reporting of this tale
of human abuse so sparsely reported in the United States.
How interconnected are the global corporations to the United States
Government, the United Nations and Agenda 21? Consider the following list of
Bechtel employees who have moved into major policy making positions both in
the United States Government and the United Nations.
-
Bechtels CEO, Riley P. Bechtel, served
on the President Bushs (43) Export Council (4/24/03)
-
George Schultz. Shortly after assuming
his new position in Bechtel, President Reagan recruited Schultz to
Washington to serve as Secretary of State.
-
Reagans Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinburger was a former Bechtel general counsel.
-
W. K. Davis was a Bechtel vice-president
for nuclear development before he was appointed as Reagans Deputy
Secretary of Energy and administrative head of the Atomic Energy
Commission.
-
William Casey a former Bechtel
consultant served in a number of government positions including
chairman of the SEC under Nixon, head of the Export-Import bank
under President Ford, and director of the CIA under Reagan.
-
Richard Helm, who later became a
consultant to Bechtel, had earlier been a CIA director under
Nixon.
-
William Simon, Nixons Treasury
secretary, was hired by Bechtel as a consultant.
-
Ross Connelly, CEO of Bechtel Energy
Resources Corporation (retired), was appointed by George W. Bush
(41) in June of 2001 to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation
(OPIC). The OPIC has strong connections to the United Nations
privatization projects.
-
Stew Burkhammer, a current Bechtel
executive, is presently a member of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administrations (OSHA) Advisory Committee on Construction
Safety and Health (Cooperative Research, 2006).
-
Marie-Fran√ßoise of Bechtel (France),
Conseiller dEtat, From 1979 to 1980, she was Consultant of the
United Nations Asian and Pacific Development Center (United Nations
Committee of Experts on Public Administration, 2007)
The connections between these groups can be
further exemplified by the following:
United Resolution 1483 (UN Security Council,
2003), approved the occupation of Iraq by American and British forces,
thus making Iraq into a de facto colony.
As such, this opened door for a corporate
feeding frenzy by companies such as Bechtel as they lined up to repair
Iraq following Gulf War II.
Subsequently, Bechtel received a $1.03 billion
contract to oversee major reconstruction of Iraq s water and sewage. In
spite of Bechtels promises, Iraqi families continue to lack access to clean
water. The company made providing Southern Iraq s potable water one of its
top priorities in which Bechtel promised delivery within 60 days following
the commencement of the project.
Within a year, Iraqi people still were suffering
through epidemics of water-borne illnesses (e.g., cholera, kidney stones and
diarrhea).
Bechtel failed to live up to its word, but they
did make a lot of money (Weston, 2003). And some people think that the
United Nations is merely a benign and benevolent organization which is
essentially neutral on all areas of politics and finance.
Today, the stock holders of Bechtel have the
United Nations to thank, in large part, for that extra vacation, their kids
braces and the addition to their homes.
Bechtel is a major player in the evolving struggle to control the worlds
future water supply. Bechtel and its peers have quietly been securing the
rights to control the production and distribution of this essential resource
and fully intend to make huge profits in the future when, as experts
predict, water becomes a significantly scarce commodity (Watson, 2003).
As a footnote, in the face of 52 civilian deaths
of Bechtel personnel, at the hands of insurgent terrorists, Bechtel did not
withdraw from Southern Iraq.
However, when its infrastructure projects came
under fire from the insurgents, costing the corporation millions of dollars,
Bechtel ceased operations in Southern Iraq. By the way, it was Bechtel which
sold Saddam its chemical stockpile of weapons in his 1980s war with Iran.
This was followed by invading Iraq because it
possessed weapons of mass destruction. I also found it interesting that
Hillary Clinton was on the Board of Directors for Bechtel at the time of the
sale of the weapons of mass destruction to Iraq (August 6th Coalition,
2006).
Before the fall of the Shah of Iran, under
President Jimmy Carter, Bechtel was contracted to build Iran s first
nuclear power plant.
As was the case with Saddam Hussein, Iran s
government is still standing in the way of unfettered investment by the
global corporations. Iran , the only Middle Eastern oil-rich country which
will not likely capitulate to President Bushs plans for a Middle East Free
Trade Area, is now being threatened by the United States military.
And remember, free trade is the one of the
cornerstones of the UNs Agenda 21. This makes one wonder who former
President Bush really worked for.
I could have chosen any number of global corporations (e.g., Monsanto,
Halliburton, etc.) to illustrate this abuse of humanity. The Bechtel
Corporation is but one small corporate example of this disturbing trend.
In the era of globalization, flying under the banner of Agenda 21s policy
of global sustainability, transnational corporations circle the globe
looking for opportunities for profit, putting peoples livelihoods, survival
and the environment at risk. Too often the global corporations victimize
unsuspecting and impoverished people who can least afford to absorb the
brunt of these profit generating schemes.
These actions severely undermine national
sovereignty and individual determinism. However, this process is not
inevitable; or infallible, successful resistance is possible. However the
clock is ticking and time is quickly running out.
Do we think that this only happening in Bolivia? Similar projects are
underway in Manilla, Pakistan and San Francisco. Yes, this is correct;
Bechtel now has a contract with San Francisco s city government to upgrade
the citys water system.
Bechtel employees are working side by side with
city workers in a privatization move that people-in-the-know fear will lead
to an eventual take-over of San Francisco s water system and create a
fiasco similar to the one in Bolivia (Chatterjee, 2000).
The wolf is at the door.
As the Roman Empire declined in influence and power, Feudalism replaced the
nation-state government. The feudal lord was one of the few employers in the
fourth and the fifth centuries. The feudal lords owned most of the land and
nearly all the resources.
Today, the specter of feudalism has shape-shifted
into a global corporatocracy headed by
the United Nations and Agenda 21.
The global corporations are constructing this
brand of neo-feudalism right before our eyes. Unfortunately, the people
(i.e., Americans) who still have the power to stop it seem to possess the
same vision-impairing flavor of glaucoma and refuse to see what is really
happening.
This is the same Agenda 21 plan which wants to
use the power of behemoth banks and corporations, under the guise of United
Nations sustainability rhetoric, in order to blackmail nations into allowing
companies like Bechtel to assess a surcharge upon poor people and their
at-risk children for daring to collect the rain water in homemade pots and
pans. In the early part of this decade, Bolivians were asking each other,
have you seen the rain in their unending search for fresh water.
Much like a teenager being lured into financial devastation by being enticed
to own their first credit card, national governments cannot resist the
addiction of seemingly infinite credit which is made available through the
use of unsecured, fiat currency.
Through the reckless spending of various
governmental entities, tremendous debt is created. As the debt reaches
critical levels and financial catastrophe looms, the World Bank rides in on
its black horse and offers a nation financial salvation. However, that
financial salvation comes at a steep cost which usually includes the selling
their national soul to the devil.
All too frequently, this salvation involves
the imposition of the political and financial agenda of the United Nations
and its partner, the World Bank. And with an Obama QE4 looming on the other
side of the fiscal cliff, America is close to being the next Bolivia.
How long will it be until America becomes the next Bolivia?
With regard to Agenda 21, this is only the tip
of the iceberg. When this country is bankrupted by the bankers, America will
be leveraged into seeking water in foreign countries and we will be all to
happy to invade countries that plenty of the resource that we no longer
have.
As the reader will discover in the second part of this series, the reader
will discover that we dont just have to worry about a banker takeover of
our water assets. we are being invaded from within.
George H. W. Bush and T. Boone Pickens
are buying up major water sources inside of our country as America is about
to get hit on two fronts.
I can see no other purpose behind this madness
except that our military will be leveraged to invade, yet another set of
countries.
