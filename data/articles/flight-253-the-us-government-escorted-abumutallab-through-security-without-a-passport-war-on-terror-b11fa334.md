Without A Passport - "War on Terror"

Flight 253 details
The government of Yemen reports that Islamic terrorists
there have been arrested who have proven ties to Israeli intelligence.
The alleged terrorists in Yemen had been in Guantanamo Prison. They were
released without trial by the
Bush Administration even though they were
reported as among the most dangerous detainees.
Abdulmutallab's father, though we are told is a retired "Nigerian banker,"
ran their defense industry in close cooperation with Israeli Intelligence (Mossad).
Abdulmutallab's father warned US embassy officials of his son's dangerous
behavior; this is corroborated with other US intelligence of warning.
Abdulmutallab's visa to the US was never withdrawn, though he was on a
"terrorist watchlist." This would make his trip impossible unless protocol
was ignored.
Flying from Nigeria, Abdulmutallab entered the Netherlands without passing
through customs; impossible to do without assistance from an intelligence
agency.
At the Amsterdam airport, Abdulmutallab was assisted by a man appearing to
be Indian, who claimed Abdulmutallab was a Sudanese refugee with no passport
(he would not have been allowed to enter the EU without a passport through
customs). This man and whoever authorized boarding without a passport are
huge stories we haven't heard.
Where is the airport videos of this?
Airport security in Amsterdam is contracted to
an Israeli company with the
most sophisticated technologies who had developed the concept of security
profiling.
During the flight to the US
Witnesses reported a man standing ten rows behind Abdulmutallab stand and
use his camcorder to film the incident before it began. This important
testimony was not pursued to discover the identity and role of this
seemingly complicit person.
Witnesses report Abdulmutallab was oddly vacant and calm; typical of a
programmed "Manchurian Candidate."
This might explain the behavior of the
person filming:
a "handler" who gave the code for Abdulmutallab to perform
an act.
Manchurian Candidates are now acknowledged historical fact.
Research
this if you are unfamiliar with the disclosed history.
After the flight
Witness on flight 253, attorney Kurt Haskell, reports that there was another
suspect handcuffed at the airport after landing that the FBI repeatedly lies
and changes their story in explaining.
Haskell says the detained passengers
were told this man was identified by a bomb-sniffing dog as having
explosives in his luggage.
The Detroit News confirms the FBI has changed their story four times.
A photo of Abdulmutallab with an alleged al Qaeda flag is from the same
organization that previously photo-shopped false background images.
50 grams of PETN positioned on a seat and cushioned underneath a passenger
are tested and would not cause significant damage to the plane.
The US and UK government are using this incident to
justify attack and
possible invasion of Yemen.
We're reminded that yes, Yemen has oil and
natural gas reserves worth
stealing.
