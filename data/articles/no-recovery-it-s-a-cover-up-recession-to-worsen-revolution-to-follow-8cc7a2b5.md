What 80 percent of economists call "Recovery" is
a "Cover up". Trillions in losses papered over with trillions of phantom
dollars printed out of thin air and backed by nothing produce nothing except
the mirage of recovery. The dollar's dive and gold's historic high is no
mirage. Gold doesn't lie.
Our trend forecasting track record is the best on record
light years ahead of Ben Bernanke's and all
those economists who didn't see the recession coming but who now talk
recovery.
In the Autumn Trends Journal we dispel the recovery as fantasy and
show how and why America and much of the world will plunge into the Greatest
Depression. The global equity market surge and bankers' bonuses do
absolutely nothing for the man on the street. Foreclosures are at an all
time high, businesses are going bankrupt, jobs continue to disappear.
While Wall Street cheers, Main Street seethes.
The 2nd American Revolution has already begun,
and it's much more than a right wing, militia driven movement. Who's behind
it, will it be velvet or violent, waged with guns or won by minds?
Across America and around the world, everyone wants to know what's going to
happen and nobody knows better than Gerald Celente. Google it up.
Celente is today's # 1 "trend expert", sought by the major media world
wide.
In a world of dry academics and glib pitchmen, Gerald Celente's dynamic,
tell-it-like-it-is, take-no-prisoners style strikes a common chord with
audiences everywhere.
When Celente is interviewed the world tunes in
and ratings rise.
