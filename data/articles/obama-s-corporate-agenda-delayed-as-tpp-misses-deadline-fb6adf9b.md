The Obama administration's pro-corporate
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agenda appears to have missed a deadline.
Ministers and delegates representing 12 nations
announced Tuesday they have failed to meet the end-of-year goal of
clinching the TPP trade deal after four days of negotiations in Singapore
ended without an agreement.
The statement immediately follows
a
Wikileaks release, exposing near zero support for a drastic
pro-corporate agenda pushed in the TPP by the Obama administration,
including demands for NAFTA-style secret corporate tribunals, limits to bank
regulation, and conditions that would increase the cost of life-saving
medicines.
"At this meeting, the negotiators political
imperative to make a deal - any deal - resulted in a raft of dangerous
decisions that would severely threaten consumers access to affordable
medicines, undermine Internet freedom and empower corporations to attack
our domestic laws," said Lori Wallach, Director of Public Citizens
Global Trade Watch.
"[A]s more details emerge weekly about the
damage TPP could do to workers, consumers and the environment,
grassroots and lawmaker opposition in many countries is growing."
No new timeline has been drafted for what is
poised to be the largest U.S. trade deal in history, establishing a "free
trade" zone between,
-
Australia
-
the U.S.
-
Canada
-
Japan
-
Mexico
-
Peru
-
Vietnam
-
Malaysia
-
Brunei
-
Chile
-
New Zealand
-
Singapore,
...countries that comprise
nearly 40 percent of the world's GDP.
Despite the breadth of this potential deal, the
contents of its negotiations have been hidden from the public and U.S.
lawmakers, with much of what is known publicly about them exposed by leaks.
"We identified potential landing zones for
the majority of key outstanding issues in the text,"
stated U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, reading a joint
statement from negotiators on Tuesday.
"We intend to meet again next month," he
said, indicating that market access issues remain unresolved.
Wikileaks released an
internal memo and
spreadsheet from an unidentified government official on Monday
that reveal resistance to U.S. demands for inclusion of corporate giveaways,
including conditions that would allow corporations to bypass national law
and sue governments in secret courts - boosting their power to steamroll
environmental, labor, and public health protections.
This also includes a push for intellectual
property conditions that would reduce access to more affordable generic
medicines and reduce the power of governments to negotiate lower medicine
prices.
The U.S., in addition, is demanding a limit to
the ability of governments to regulate banks in times of crisis,
according to Zach Carter at the Huffington Post.
The leaked memo reads,
"Inadequate progress. The positions are
still paralyzed. United States shows zero flexibility," regarding
financial services negotiations.
In a statement emailed to Common Dreams,
Public Citizen warned,
"However, many countries have caved to
relentless U.S. demands that they alter their domestic patent and
medicine pricing laws to meet the desires of large
pharmaceutical
firms."
This latest leak follows the November 13
Wikileaks exposure of the Obama
administration's TPP push to erode internet freedoms and cut access to
medicines in what
analysts say
are the most damaging and dangerous proposals in the history of U.S. "free
trade" deals.
