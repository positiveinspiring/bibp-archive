It was just a few days ago I blogged about
Google boosting up their lobbying effort in DC.
To stay competitive with
Google, Facebook is gearing up to pour in more cash into their
lobbying branch in Washington, DC as well. Facebooks interest and
involvement in DC though goes further as they are in talk with the
intelligence community, Office of the Director of National Security that
advises the President and works with the CIA.
Facebook has been gradually boosting its profile in Washington D.C. over the
past year and is on the hunt for a second senior lobbyist to add to its
office of four.
Disclosures released a few days ago show that,
on top of lobbying the usual suspects Internet companies reach out to like
the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. senators and representatives, the
fast-growing social network has also been busy deepening ties to government
intelligence and homeland security agencies.
Facebook spent $41,390 on lobbying in the
first quarter of 2010. Thats on top of the $207,878 it spent last year -
the first year Facebook began releasing such disclosures.
Although these numbers are tiny compared to
the $1.3 million Google spent on lobbying
just during the first quarter this year, expect them to grow with the
companys influence and ambitions.
Funny thing is Facebook has raised privacy concerns for their users
numerous times. Now they are talking to intelligence agencies on the federal
level.
What are they talking about? Privacy concerns,
MY ASS!
So, If I were you, I would give it a second thought before I add
any additional information into my Facebook profile.
