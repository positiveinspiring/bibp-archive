Igor Panarin, dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry
School for future diplomats, believes that President Obama will announce
martial law by the end of 2012.
He explains:
Theres a 55-45% chance right now that
disintegration will occur.
In 2009, Panarin
lectured at the Diplomatic Academy where he said that he believes that
the US will begin to collapse in 2010. He compared America to Nazi Germany
and blamed the US for the global financial crisis that destroyed the Russian
economy.
Panarin said that American society is in
decline, referencing school shootings like Columbine. Combined with the
banker bailouts in 2008 as proof that the US is no longer the global
dominating economy, Paranrin believes that the American dream is over.
He
asserts
that mass immigration, economic decline and moral degradation will
plunge America into a civil war that will center on the collapse of the US
dollar.
Origin
Panarin created a map of how he perceived the US
would divide. He asserted that parts of the US would be taken over by
foreign interests.
Considering the social climate emerging in
America, Panarins words seem prophetic.
Lubbock County Judge Tom Head said on a local
FOX affiliate station that he is
convinced that Obamas re-election would spawn civil unrest which would
justify the US governments use of martial law to quell the public. Head is
seeking an increase in local taxes to beef up the Lubbock County Sheriffs
office and district attorneys office.
Head expressed concern that Obama would deploy
UN NATO troops onto US soil should civil unrest be declared.
Head said:
Hes going to try to hand over the sovereignty of the U.S. to the United
Nations, whats going to happen when that happens? Im thinking worst case
scenario. Civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war maybe
were not just
talking a few riots or demonstrations.
In March of 2012, Obama signed the
National Defense Resources Preparedness (NDRP) executive order that
declared peacetime marital law.
Obama granted himself authority over all
domestic energy, production, transportation, food and water in the name of
National Security.
The NDRP has roots in the
Defense Production Act of 1950 wherein the US government was empowered
to dispense national resources in the event of a national emergency that
would define any or all Americans as a challenge to the government. Control
over all US citizens would be required to maintain continuity of government.
The president and advisors would be able to use this directive as they saw
fit if the situation warranted.
It was no mistake that the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
declared the domestic US a
battlefield. The ability to detain any American citizen without charge or
trial, solely on suspicion is key to the power of the NDAA.
As defined in the NDRP, the President allocated
control over American resources to specific federal agencies to oversee
their dispensation.
-
The Secretary of Defense has power over
all water resources
-
The Secretary of Commerce has power over
all material services and facilities, including construction
materials
-
The Secretary of Transportation has
power over all forms of civilian transportation
-
The Secretary of Agriculture has power
over food resources and facilities, livestock plant health
resources, and the domestic distribution of farm equipment
-
The Secretary of Health and Human
Services has power over all health resources
-
The Secretary of Energy has power over
all forms of energy
Under Nazi-controlled Germany, the beginning of
Totalitarian control was evidenced in May of 1942 when freezing of food
prices led to national rationing in 1943.
With the Nazis controlling
resource dispersion, all citizens needed
ration cards to obtain food, gas,
and even a vacation pass that allotted the restriction of movement.
Between the
NDAA and
NDRP, a Nazi-model of
control over the general population in America is laid out.
The Executive
Branch, having been given the power to control all resources that are
necessary to sustain all citizens, they have forced Americans to become
completely subservient to the US government.
The executive order is not permitted by the US
Constitution that states:
All legislative powers herein granted shall be
vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate
and House of Representatives.
The advent of executive orders completely
circumvents the power of the Congress and gives the Executive Branch
unilateral power. The use of executive orders has become popular as a way to
control America in wartime and advent of national emergencies.
Obama has set a precedent by announcing the
pre-cursor to suspension of the US Constitution during peacetime.
The first suspension of the US Constitution and
Bill of Rights was performed by Abraham Lincoln during the US Civil War.
This enabled Lincoln to authorize the unlawful detainment of political
prisoners without Congressional approval.
The second declaration of unconstitutional
detainment of US citizens was ordered by President FDR in 1941 with the
roundup of Japanese-Americans who were sent to detainment camps to be held
without charge during WW II.
For the past 30 years, plans for the
takeover of
America have been laid in a long line of executive orders.
By stifling
Congressional approval, the Executive Branch has been empowered to detain
any and all US citizens, suspend all media and restrict any and all
Americans in any and all ways deemed appropriate by the President.
We are in the midst of a Fascist takeover of our
Constitutional Republic.
