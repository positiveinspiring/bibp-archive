Headlines over the past weeks have once again
been dominated by
the global financial crisis with markets plunging around
the globe.
The prospect of a second credit crisis is
growing and the warnings are ominous. Confidence that conditions can improve
is plummeting in financial circles as hope is lost for the European Union
and the Euro. Markets have been swinging madly and hope is running out that
world leaders can save us from what they have, in their stupidity, managed
to accomplish.
The head of Chinas biggest ratings agency,
Dagong Global Credit Rating,
is warning that it may downgrade the USs sovereign debt rating again
because of Washingtons failure to tackle the federal budget deficit. The
remarks by Dagongs chairman, Guan Jianzhong, came at the end of
another week of deep turmoil for the world economy.
Things are getting quite uncomfortable in the
world and the stakes have never been higher than they are today. Only the worst fools have been thinking that the world was going to solve
its debt problem with more debt.
Over the past 30 years, the global
financial system has constructed a gigantic mountain of debt, risk and
leverage unlike anything the world has ever seen before. At some point the
whole thing is going to come crashing down.
When it does, it is going to affect just about
everyone.

It is now three years on from the start of
the financial collapse.
It is still happening. It didnt go away.
Its just that its now getting worse. We are still stuck in the middle
of it. The pause button was hit for fear of allowing the action to play
out. The upcoming scenes were just too horrific to contemplate. The
press of that pause button was the big bank bailout.
The idea was that we could hit the next
chapter button after the pause. Unfortunately the horrific deleted
scenes have appeared instead. It seems like everything which was there
the day before Lehmans crashed on September 15, 2008, is actually
pretty much still there now: same teetering, dodgy, private sector debt.
And all of it
in banks.
No one in the world is more in love with getting
deeply into debt than the United States government.
The U.S. national debt - any day now - will
soar above the $15 trillion mark. As of this writing, the total debt is
$14.97 trillion, so moving beyond the symbolic $15 trillion is a
foregone conclusion, reports ABC News.
How in the world do supposedly rational people
living in the greatest nation on earth allow themselves to commit national
financial suicide by allowing government debt to explode?
The answer to this question was recently seen at
the
recent G-20 meeting where the participants were seen unloading from the
limos onto a red carpet. One would have thought the G-20 was the Oscars but
no - all these diplomats came to discuss austerity.
Most of Europe and Japan are not far behind the US in what has become a
one-way street into the hell of deep debt. This hell comes only after one
has enjoyed what the debt at first buys and brings to our individual and
then collective lives.
Bob Chapman
writes,
Obviously government cannot function unless
we continue as we have been, building more debt, and Americans will just
have to be patient until the whole debt edifice collapses.
The Burning Platform
published:
The EU has put a tourniquet over a cancerous
tumor. The entire world is awash in bad debt and until this debt is
liquidated, we will stagger from crisis to crisis like a drunken sailor.
John Hussman describes the master plan:
In effect, European leaders have
announced,
We have agreed to solve our debt problem, leveraging
money we do not have to create a fund, which will then borrow
several times that amount in order to buy enormous amounts of new
debt that we will need to issue.
As politicians and central bankers around the world desperately try
to keep their debt-drenched
ponzi scheme going for awhile longer,
the mood darkens among the populations of developed countries around
the world.
I came across a quote from, of all
people, Vladimir Lenin that describes how the last six weeks seemed
to me:
There are decades where nothing
happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.
It seems like history is accelerating.
Momentous events have been occurring regularly since 2007.
Our political and financial leaders are
blindsided on a daily basis by each new crisis. The majority of the
American public continues to be apathetic, willfully ignorant, and
constantly absorbed by their array of electronic gadgets and
mindless drivel spewed at them by media conglomerates.
Rather than think critically, most
Americans allow left wing and right wing mainstream media to
formulate their opinions for them through their propaganda and
misinformation operations.
Sadly, the nation is filled with people
that dont want to think.
Have you ever fallen into a well? No matter how
hard you try to climb out of the water, the walls are too slippery and
round.
Its a no-go and the sooner you realize this and
conserve your energy the better. What should you do if you have a debt
problem? First recognize that you have a problem and then stop spending. If
the federal government were humble enough to recognize their problem and sit
before a financial debt counselor, they would be told to stop feeding the
beast - quit paying for things they cant afford!
But no government (because they are run by politicians and bureaucrats)
takes good advice and now its too late.
Stopping debt creation (austerity) is suicidal
but the kicker is that if we do not put an end to our financial system it
will collapse on its own, destroying millions in the process. Its like
driving a car at high speed into a six-foot-thick wall.
We can pull the trigger and blow our brains out
before hitting the wall or wait for the wall to end things for us.
Either way the end will not be pretty...
Someone who is addicted to debt uses debt as a
crutch for solving their
financial and personal problems without any plan for living differently
or getting out of debt. Other signs include living paycheck to paycheck
and never planning for the future, constantly being in financial crisis,
or being unwilling to take care of oneself in order to pay creditors.
Nothing is solved when you give a heroin addict
more heroin. Same goes for the drunk.
Managing problems
without solving anything is the best politicians can do. Its like treading
water in that well. You know you are going to drown sooner or later but you
still keep kicking.
Some screaming might bring help but who is going
to come to the rescue of the Americans or the Europeans who have been
trampling over humanity for centuries?
Right now there are over 45 million Americans on
food stamps.
The economy is supposed to be recovering, but
the number of Americans on food stamps has grown by over eight percent in
just the past year.
The Automatic Earth wrote a few months ago,
On the real issues, nothing has changed
since at least the demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman, and arguably way
before that. There is too much debt in the system, way too much, perhaps
as much as 10, 100 or even 1000 times too much.
A government spending itself into colossal
new debt levels can perhaps create the illusion of recovery for a
limited period of time (check), but it will all end up just making
things worse down the line.
Whether you are buying a car, a home, clothes or
electronics, or fighting
a war that you cannot afford to fight, it is irrelevant. The key is that
you are buying what you cannot afford. If you regularly spend money
you dont have, you are a heavy debt user. If you cannot afford to pay
your bills and you continue to spend money, you are a debt addict.
The economic contraction that is beginning to be
felt everywhere is going to make mincemeat out of the tax base and thus the
fiscal condition of cities, states and the federal government.
The bells of doom, can you hear them ringing?
The Catholic Church is certainly ringing them
and that should send a chill up our spines.
Trust the Church?
The Catholic Churchs call for a world financial authority is chilling
because it is enslaving madmen who will be put at the helm.
Humanity is on a collision course with itself
and Nature seems to be cheering, pressing many to a terrible end. The
present and near future promises historic moments and sanity is not assured
when the masses wake up to the extreme danger facing them and their
families.
Neither extreme fascist control nor total anarchy are kind choices. We know
which way
the elite want things to go and now we know
the intention of
the Catholic Church, which has never been kind to men,
woman and children.
Its history is stained with blood. It has
tortured and killed in
God's name and creates conditions where its
priests
turn into pedophiles.
Their sacred music is nice but that is no comfort and offers no protection
from the dark energy that has ruled the church since its beginnings in Rome.
From the ashes of Roman evil the church rose through the centuries and ruled
with a supreme hand during the dark ages.
I say this as a custodian of a sacred shrine for
Mother Mary, who, like her son, would have parsecs (astronomical
measurement) of shame for the Church and its actions.
Only Ourselves to Blame
The Burning Platform
said,
Our Baby Boomer leaders did the exact
opposite of the right thing.
They held the American taxpayer hostage and
absconded with trillions of their tax dollars and handed it over to the
same Wall Street banks that had run the largest fraud scheme in world
history and blew up the worldwide financial system.
The politicians borrowed trillions from
future unborn generations to inflict a Keynesian nightmare of solutions
on the American economy. It seems the young people in this country have
realized they have no future when the system is run for the benefit of
an oligarchy consisting of Wall Street banks, mega-corporations, media
conglomerates, and puppet politicians
in Washington D.C.
These people will stop at nothing to retain
their wealth and power. Not only do they want to retain it, they are
actively trying to increase it. They have achieved their goal beyond all
expectations, and are still able to convince a large portion of the
population through their propaganda machine that they deserve every
penny.
When the 400 wealthiest Americans own more
than the lower 150 million Americans put together, you have a system
that is badly broken.
The Eurozone and U.S. sovereign debt crisis will continue to grow
dramatically worse in 2012 as debt levels among Western nations
continues to soar. As bad as 2011 was, 2012 may push the world into even
more adverse uncharted economic territory.
Japan, the Eurozone, and even
the U.S. are struggling with massive deficits as their economies
deteriorate, unemployment rises, and natural disasters increase.
The U.S. federal debt could exceed $17
trillion dollars by the end of 2012,
writes the Extinction Protocol.
These next weeks and months will have a lot to
say to us so we better be listening.
There is really nothing much we can do about
what is happening out there in the world but there is plenty we can do to
prepare physically as well as spiritually.
