It is a film, however, which will certainly have
long term implications for the state of Australia.
'Expendable', produced under conditions of strict secrecy in the US,
demonstrates a lengthy series of corrupt and criminal acts by Australian
politicians, sanctioned collectively by an Australian government.
These
involve not only activities at ministerial level, but central roles for
Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers, and a number of prominent
corporations.
Demonstrate is the operative word, because these are not allegations. Every
abuse of power covered in the film is supported by documented proof, usually
in the form of cables and correspondence between government ministers. These
were pre-published on the Expendable website for public scrutiny.
Further, collectively, the movie and supporting dossiers are currently being
collated for submission to the United Nations, and the International
Criminal Court in The Hague.
THE MOVIE
The 'Expendable' film documents the case of
Schapelle Corby, a young
Australian woman, who was sentenced to 20 years in an Indonesian prison in
2005, when 4.2kg of marijuana was found in her bag as she collected it on
arrival in Bali.
The movie tracks the Australian government's response, which included the
willful withholding of vital primary evidence.
This included the information
that 5kg had been added to the weight of her bags after check-in, and that
the offending bag was the only one not screened at Sydney airport, which she
passed through on route.
The need to hide the systemic scale of post 9-11 corruption at Australian
airports, including within the AFP, and the strategic policy of the
appeasement of Indonesia, frame these, and a whole series of other acts of
hostility against her.
The steps taken to cover this policy, post her trial, are equally appalling.
The film shows, supported by indisputable government records,
-
how public
opinion was managed
-
how Schapelle Corby was deprived of funds for an
extraordinary appeal
-
how the AFP's role was hidden
-
how known abuses of her
human rights were ignored
-
how a range of other hostile activities
were initiated
From the blurb issued with the film itself:
"It presents, and demonstrates,
the crushing, pre-meditated, and often brutal acts which a western
government is prepared to inflict upon a helpless citizen in pursuit of
political expediency."
THE AUSTRALIAN MEDIA
The lack of plurality of ownership of the Australian media is a point made
early in the film segment covering the state-owned Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC).
The implications of this resonate to this day.
In Australia, dead men cannot sue, a device which, since the death of
Schapelle Corby's father, has been ruthlessly exploited by unethical
publishers, to spin and re-spin wholly disproved smears. The 'Expendable'
producers present several concise 'insider' interviews, which dramatically
expose the shady world which operates under the banner of journalism.
Presenting such objectionable material is by no means limited to the ABC,
with the press organs of Fairfax Media, for example, also being prominent.
It is within this climate that, since the Expendable Project began
publishing government cables in September 2011, not a single column inch of
coverage has been forthcoming in the Australian mainstream media.
Incredibly, authentic correspondence proving gross misconduct and a series
of corrupt acts by an Australian government, has been blanked
completely, whilst fabricated paid-for smears against a dead man have
continued unabated.
News of the release of the film itself is likely to meet a similar fate, as
is the involvement of the ICC, the UN, and other international agencies.
SCHAPELLE CORBY
Schapelle Corby herself, enduring her eighth year in an Indonesian prison
cell, is now mentally ill. At the end of last year, she attempted suicide,
via a huge overdose of the drugs she is prescribed for her psychosis.
Even this, however, has proved to be insufficient for her government to
negotiate her release, or for the Indonesians to demonstrate even a hint of
mercy or compassion.
It appears that, as the film states,
"she is dying a
slow torturous death, in squalor, devoid of human rights, and abandoned by
her government."
EXPENDABLE THE MOVIE
This film is a wake up call for any traveler, any individual who places
trust in political leaders or governments, and any humanitarian who believes
that human decency will always prevail.
It creates a new perspective of the nation state of Australia, and presents
a stark warning of the dangers of an overly cozy press caucus.
It is a film you will not forget.
