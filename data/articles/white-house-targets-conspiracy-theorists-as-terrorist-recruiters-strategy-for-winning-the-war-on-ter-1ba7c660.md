A document cited by President Bush in his recent speech at the Capital
Hilton Hotel on how to 'win the war on terror' cites conspiracies as one of
the wellsprings of terrorism and threatens to "address" and "diminish" the
problems they are causing the government in fulfilling their agenda.
On Tuesday
Bush referred to the strategy paper
as,
"an unclassified version of the strategy
we've been pursuing since September the 11th, 2001," that takes into
account, "the changing nature of this enemy."
The document says that terrorism springs
from,
"subcultures of conspiracy and
misinformation," and that "terrorists recruit more effectively from
populations whose information about the world is contaminated by
falsehoods and corrupted by conspiracy theories. The distortions keep
alive grievances and filter out facts that would challenge popular
prejudices and self-serving propaganda."
The terminology echoes President Bush's speech
(video below) to the UN General Assembly on November 10th 2001 in which he
stated,
"Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy
theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th, malicious lies
that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,
away from the guilty."
This is an outright threat to
the 9/11 truth
movement and is meant to have a chilling effect on freedom of speech.
It is also a callous reminder that the administration that has been the
progenitor of the most heinous and deliberate campaign to mislead and lie to
its own people is so transfixed by its own hubris that it has the temerity
to accuse others of propagating deceptive information.
This is the same administration that deliberately included the Niger yellow
cake fraud in a state of the union speech to sell a war - knowing that the
information was completely bogus.
How dare they threaten us with the very defining characteristic of their
black legacy and equate us with terrorists?
This is a direct assault on the alternative media and a continuation of the
twilight zone rhetoric that saw the administration attempt to link its
critics with Fascists and Hitler appeasers. The only fascists that should
really concern us are not imaginary 'Blogofascists' or 'Islamofascists' but
the Neo-Fascist slugs that occupy the White House and their cheerleading
sycophants in the mainstream media and congress.
This is by no means the first time political enemies of the state have been
smeared as terrorist sympathizers.
Alex Jones' 2001 documentary film
9/11: The Road
to Tyranny featured footage from a FEMA symposium given to firefighters and
other emergency personnel in Kansas City in which it was stated that the
founding fathers, Christians and homeschoolers were terrorists and should be
treated with the utmost suspicion and brutality in times of national
emergency.
We have highlighted previous training manuals issues by state and federal
government bodies which identify whole swathes of the population as
potential terrorists. A
Texas Department of Public Safety Criminal Law
Enforcement pamphlet gives the public characteristics to identify terrorists
that include buying baby formula, beer, wearing Levi jeans, carrying
identifying documents like a drivers license and traveling with women or
children.
A
Virginia training manual used to help state employees recognize terrorists
lists anti-government and property rights activists as terrorists and
includes binoculars, video cameras, pads and notebooks in a compendium of
terrorist tools.
Shortly after 9/11 a
Phoenix FBI manual that was disseminated amongst
federal employees at the end of the Clinton term caused waves on the
Internet after it was revealed that potential terrorists included,
"defenders of the US Constitution against federal government and the UN,"
and individuals who "make numerous references to the US Constitution."
Lawyers everywhere cowered in fear at being shipped off to Gitmo.
In May we broke the exclusive of a nationwide
FEMA program which is training
Pastors and other religious representatives to become secret police
enforcers who teach their congregations to "obey the government" in
preparation for a declaration of martial law, property and firearm seizures,
and forced relocation.
