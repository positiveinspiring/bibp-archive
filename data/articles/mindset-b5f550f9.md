Mindset of the
Internationalists/Globalists
Garry Allen wrote in his bestseller "Say No to the New World Order" the following:
"What in the world" you are probably asking yourself, "is a New World Order?" One of the best descriptions was contained in a film you have probably seen; the movie "Network" with the multi-national corporate chairman Mr. Jensen and the TV anchorman Howard Beal."
"In that one brilliant scene, Paddy Chayevsky almost perfectly captured the mentality of the people working for a New World Order. In order to give you the flavor of the tone in which the words are spoken, THE SHOUTING IS IN CAPITALS, the normal-speaking parts are in regular type, and the softer, whispered parts are in italics.
We pick up the scene as Mr. Jensen continues his "explanation:"
"You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and people. There are no Russians. There are no nations. There are no people. There are no Arabs. There are no third worlds. THERE IS NO WEST. There is only one holistic system of systems. One vast, interwoven, interacting, multi-variant, multi-national dominion of dollars. Petrodollars, electrodollars, multidollars, Reichmarks, yen, RUBLES, POUNDS, and sheckels. It is the international system, the currency, which determines the totality of life on the planet. That is the natural order of things today.
"THAT IS THE ATOMIC AND THE SUBATOMIC AND GALACTIC STRUCTURE OF THINGS TODAY. AND YOU HAVE MEDDLED WITH THE PRIMAL FORCES OF NATURE.
"Gritting his teeth and shaking his feet at the awestruck Beal, Mr. Jensen froths, "AND YOU WILL ATONE!
"Then in the most natural and cal voice possible, he asks, "Am I getting through you, Mr. Beal?" Without waiting for an answer, he plunges ahead: "You get up on your little 21-inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America; there is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont and Dow and Union Carbide and Exxon. Those are the nations of today.
"What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state? Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, stoical decision theories, minimax solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments. Just like we do.
"We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beal. The world is a business, Mr. Beal, and it has been since man crawled out of the slime." Winding down, the chairman is now going to give Howard Beal, and us his vision of the future:
"Our children will live, Mr. Beal, to see that (perfect world) in which there is no war and famine, oppression or brutality." Almost in tears, he concludes in a soft, caressing voice, "One vast and ecumenical holy cup for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock."Now, barely audible, he whispers, "All necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused." Then, in a perfectly normal voice, placing his hand gently on the old man' shoulder, and his face shadowed by a gleam of sunlight, he says, "I have chosen you, Mr. Beal, to preach this adventure."
Humbled and with reverent expectation, Beal asks, "Why me?"
And Jensen offers the perfect reply: "Because you're on television, dummy. Sixty million people watch you every night of the week, Monday through Friday."
And Howard Beal, choking back the joyous tears of a convert, looking up at the silhouetted chairman standing above him, responds, "I have seen the face of God."
The chairman concludes, "You just might be right, Mr. Beal."
WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD ORDER!-WELCOME TO OUR GLOBAL NEIGHBORHOOD!
