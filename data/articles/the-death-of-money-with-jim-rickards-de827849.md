The
International Monetary Fund trimmed its
outlook for global economic growth in 2014. But the one place not engulfed
by this gloomy outlook is the UK, which the IMF expects to grow by 2.9% in
2014. Erin brings you the details.
Erin Ade then sits down with economist and author Jim Rickards on his new
book, "The Death of Money
- The Coming Collapse of the International Monetary
System."
We ask Rickards about the threats to the US
dollar in his book.
It covers the IMF, emerging markets, and the Fed, among
other things. For today's Big Deal, Edward Harrison and Erin discuss
how Apple, Google and other big tech companies allegedly fixed the high tech
labor market.
