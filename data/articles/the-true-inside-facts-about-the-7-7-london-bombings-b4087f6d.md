The British and US government are stirring an atmosphere of animosity and
hatred between white and Asian people in the UK, US and around the world.
Whites verses Asians invents the excuse for the invasion of the Middle East.
They are also looking for a minority to blame for the terrorism in the UK
and US that the governments themselves are responsible for.
This is known as false flag terrorism.
'Al Qaeda' is an MI-6, CIA
organization utilizing Middle Eastern assets. These are big claims but this
is backed up with evidence from my MI-6 contacts.
My friend below was
briefed in detail regarding what really happened on 7/7 and how the British
Government were responsible.
James Casbolt - So you are saying the bombs were planted into the bus
several days before the 7/7 London bombings
X10 - Yes, the British government switched the safety checking team. When
they went into the bus depot a few days before hand a trade union spokesman
who was asked about this said he couldnt understand who the security was.
He didnt recognize anybody. These were people who come into check the
buses. They normally check the buses for things like suspension, braking
systems and the security cameras. Instead of staying what is usually an hour
or so these people were there for the entire day. When workers approached
them and started making small talk they were basically ignored . So they
had the feeling that these people were not regular security.
James Casbolt - So they were probably MI 5?
X10 - They were MI 5. They were there primarily to make sure the video
camera went off at a certain time. Which is of course what happened. Isnt
it is amazing that on that day, this was similar to what happened with the
cameras prior to the death of Princess Diana. All the security cameras that
counted on 7/7, not the ones that didnt count, the ones that really counted
weren't working. The security camera on that bus wasn't working on that
particular day.
James Casbolt - So where did they plant the bombs on the bus?
X10 - Inside the seats and under the floor. I know that the eye witness
accounts of what happened were all at variance with one another. The BBC
relied exclusively on a testimony given by a Scottish guy. The Scottish guy
contradicted himself so many times and yet no one in the media asked him
about these contradictory statements. He said in one report that he got off
the front of the bus and in another report he said he left through the rear
door. One report said he was the first out and another report he said was
the last off the bus. So there appears to be a lot of confusion in terms of
the report
James Casbolt - So the four Asian lads were they MI 5 assets?
X10 - They were stooges
James Casbolt - Do you think they consciously knew they were working for
MI5?
X10 - No they werent working consciously for MI 5. They would just be a
shadow team lured into London to be part of a covert program of simulated
attacks. They were paid to be in a certain place at a certain time to take
part in a simulated attack. A company was running a simulated terror attack
at the time. Those boys were part of that. They were told Your backpacks
represent explosive devices but of course they aren't explosives
James Casbolt - So they were told this is just a dummy run
X10 - It was a dummy run. They were part of the dummy run. They stopped
their car just outside of Luton and they were briefed by somebody. When they
left Luton of course, they didnt leave Luton at the time described because
there was a cock up with train times. So whether they managed to get to
London or not is an unknown because the video camera evidence has been shown
to be faulty. There is a problem with the timing on some of the video footage.
James Casbolt - So they bought return tickets?
X10 - Yea, they bought return tickets. Of course you wouldn't but return
tickets if you knew you were on a one way journey to hell. Some of the other
reports that were briefly mentioned in the quality, alternative media and
not the tabloid media. Then they were completely ignored by the controlled
tabloid media, was one eye witness who was talking about the fact that as
she was coming off the train were the bomb exploded.
The police officer said
Mind the hole! and he pointed to a huge blast which showed the metal
structure of the under carriage facing upwards as if the bomb had blown
upwards. This was the security services taking the extra insurance that in
case any of the bombs that their agents had left on the train and those were
ex MI 5, ex SAS people, that they would have had a back up, a contingency to
make sure those explosions did take place. A number of reports reported more
bombs than there were alleged terrorists.
James Casbolt - Why is it ex MI 5 doing it? Why is it not active MI5 agents?
X10 - In a way there is no such thing as ex MI 5. Once your MI 5 youre
always MI 5 (I would have to disagree with that statement as I managed to
get away from my involvement with MI 6 - James Casbolt). A lot of MI 5 people
get jobs with other organization that are similar in structure when they
leave the security services.
These organizations are usually part of the
private sector. There have been a number of these organizations over the
years. A very, very famous intelligence unit that used to work under Peter
Mandelson involved in the oil business, and they announced a disclosure
about three years ago. Norton Taylor who works for the intelligence part of
the Guardian. He pointed out then that such organizations often announce
their demise and its nothing of the sort. Its just disinformation or they
just change into another company with exactly the same brief.
There are a lot of
these little private organizations that soak up people who have left these
intelligence services and they have them working on a private basis but more
often than not they are contracted and they get work contracted out to them
from the government
James Casbolt - So the four Asian lads, they were probably having their
strings pulled by MI 5 officers
X10 - Oh yea, absolutely without a doubt. They were runners, a dummy team.
Ive spoken to a few people about the way in which dummy teams are run. They
interest lads like that, what MI5 do is they say something like We want you
to be part of a film, part of a dummy run working with the government and
also working with BBC producers on developing scenarios in which terrorist
attacks in the UK could take place.
You get to London and then you do this,
meet us at a certain place and we give you a thousand quid. Thats easy
money and its easy money for what? Travelling to London, sitting on a train
with a backpack for about half an hour or so and you collect your loot
James Casbolt - Do you think Mohammad Sidique Khan would have been a conscious MI 5 agent?
X10 - He may have been paid by MI 5 to go through that on the TV. The same
way as, there is another guy who is a known MI 5 agent. He used to be the
sidekick of Abdul H the Muslim preacher. He was no 2. He was a Mr fixer
and had links to all sorts of exotic quasi terrorist organizations, which
are of course almost all run by British intelligence. I wish I could
remember his name
James Casbolt - You said one of the ex SAS men who was responsible for the
bombings was called McGregor and he was disguised as a homeless person.
X10 - That's what they do to blend in, well not blend in but to make them
look conspicuous. If youve got a homeless person clutching an old Tescos
bag or something you dont tend to look at him and say the guy looks like
security threat
James Casbolt - Can you explain what he did
X10 - He was on the train and left a package with explosives in. The man who
told me this, I developed a close relationship in the past and trusted him
James Casbolt - And this man was an MI 6 officer?
X10 - Ex MI 6. He longer worked for them. Even in the days when I knew him
he had already left the service. As far as the bus operations were concerned
that was not his main topic. He was talking mostly about the people in the
tube bombings. When all of the eye witness statements came up later on
talking about the possibility that the bombs may have been placed under the
buses, what the government did was put in a fail safe to make sure that even
if some thing went wrong on the day with those people who were involved in
the bombings themselves, they would at least have a secondary system to
ensure the bombs exploded at exactly the time they wanted
James Casbolt - So would they have been set on timers?
X10 - They were set on timers
James Casbolt - So they wouldnt have needed to remotely detonated?
X10 - No. This whole remote system is quite strange because on the day
itself Ian Blair took down all of the mobile phone communications.
Everything was switched off. You couldnt make a mobile phone call. He knew
in any event that there were no remote detonators and he was just covering
his arse in case any curious journalists asked him a pertinent question
later on. There were no remote detonations on the day at all. They were all
personally delivered to the destinations
James Casbolt - What happened on the tube then?
X10 - The agents were there at the exactly the right time they were supposed
to be. If it was the actual case that those guys actually did get the train
from Luton. I dont believe they got the train from Luton because apparently
that train never turned up. But if they had got to London before hand which
s probably the case, they would have had plenty of time to receive the
briefing in London. They would have got on train. They would have then been
followed by these ex MI 5, SAS officers so that they were actually in the
same cart as the so-called juvenile bombers. It would have taken place as
scheduled
James Casbolt - So the guys on the train who were ex MI 5, ex SAS, they left
the explosives on the train and then got off. What were their names again?
X10 - The ex MI 5 man was codenamed J-boy and McGregor was the ex SAS
guy
James Casbolt - And then you say they escaped in a Vauxhall cabriolet?
X10 - Yes and they were driven away from the scene
James Casbolt - So your MI 6 contact confirmed it was a Vauxhall cabriolet?
X10 - Yes
James Casbolt - So J-boy and
McGregor left explosives in bags under the
seats but there were secondary explosives under the train carriage in case
they didnt go off
X10 - Yes
James Casbolt - Do you know were the safe house was were
McGregor and J-boy
went afterwards
X10 - The safe house was in South London. This is a very unfortunate event
that is going to churning around in peoples minds for a long time to come.
We need a proper public enquiry
To the government factions who were involved in this act of mass killing I
say this.
How dare you blow up and murder my British people! All those who
are accountable will be held fully accountable when the time comes! That
time is coming soon. In my vision I see Asian and white brothers and sisters
coming together in love and harmony in this country.
We will confront the
government peacefully for their terrorist crimes.
