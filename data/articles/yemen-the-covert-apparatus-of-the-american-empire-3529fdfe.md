In 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
delivered one of his least known and ultimately one of his most important
speeches ever, Beyond Vietnam, in which he spoke out against the American
war in Vietnam and against American empire in all its political, military
and economic forms.
In his speech, King endorsed the notion that
America was on the wrong side of a world revolution.
Dr. King explained:
During the past ten years we have seen
emerge a pattern of suppression which now has justified the presence of
U.S. military "advisors" in Venezuela. This need to maintain social
stability for our investments accounts for the counter-revolutionary
action of American forces in Guatemala. It tells why American
helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Colombia and why
American napalm and green beret forces have already been active against
rebels in Peru.
It is with such activity in mind that the
words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us.
Five years ago he said,
"Those who make peaceful revolution
impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."[1]
This is the nature of war of today: during
Kings time, the pretext for war was to stop the spread of Communism; today,
its done in the name of stopping the spread of terrorism.
Terror has since time immemorial been a tactic
used by states and governments to control populations.
Al-Qaeda is no
exception, as it was created and continues to largely function as a
geopolitical extension of the covert apparatus of American empire. In short,
al-Qaeda is an arm of the covert world of American intelligence agencies.
In particular, the,
Where they go, al-Qaeda goes; where al-Qaeda
goes, they accumulate; where they lay the groundwork, the American empire
stands behind.[2]
Yemen is perhaps an excellent example of America being on the wrong side of
a world revolution, as the secret war in Yemen being exacerbated in the
name of fighting al-Qaeda is in actuality, about the expansion and
supremacy of American power in the region.
It is about the suppression of natural
democratic, local, revolutionary elements throughout the country seeking
self-autonomy in changing the nation from its current despotic,
authoritarian rule sympathetic to American interests, into a nation of their
own choosing. It is about repressing struggles for liberation.
This brings in the involvement of Saudi Arabia, itself interested in
ensuring Yemen is a loyal neighbor; so they too must suppress indigenous
movements within Yemen seeking autonomy, especially those that are Shia
Muslims, as the Saudi state is a strict
Wahhabist Sunni Muslim regime.
Shias are primarily represented in the region
through the state of Iran, Saudi Arabias natural enemy; both vying for
influence in Iraq and both vying for influence in Yemen. Through this we see
another key American imperial aim in this war, that of seeking to stir up a
conflict with Iran, perhaps through a proxy-war within Yemen, or perhaps in
hopes that the proxy war would expand into a regional war between Saudi
Arabia and Iran, naturally drawing in Israel, Egypt and the United States.
Finally, we have the strategic location of Yemen
to consider, bridging one of the largest oil transport routes in the world,
parallel to Somalia and the Horn of Africa (where America is waging another
war, again on the wrong side of a world revolution).
Just as American geopolitical strategists had chosen to favor Tutsis over
Hutus in Central Africa in an effort to expand the American presence and
business interests in the region; so too have American strategists chosen to
favor a brand of radical Sunni Islam over the Shia or moderate Sunnis, and
thus they support oppressive Sunni governments (such as Saudi Arabia), and
denounce Shia governments as oppressive (such as Iran).
Not to say that there is no oppression within
Iran (there is oppression within all states everywhere in the world, Iran is
no exception), but compared to Saudi Arabia, Iran is a bastion of freedom.
Al-Qaeda is manifestly a significant facet of the pro-Wahhabist
fundamentalist Sunni strategy of American imperialists.
If they finance, train and arm the Sunni rebels
or send in already-trained, armed and well-funded terrorists (commonly known
as al-Qaeda - the database), then they create a counter to any other
domestic opposition or regional Shia dominance.
This essay examines the American war in Yemen as a war of empire, as a war
against the rising tide of peoples movements and the global political
awakening that is taking place around the world.
Yemen, Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and the Art of Empire
To understand the current conflict in Yemen, as with all conflicts, we must
go to history.
To simply cast the conflict aside in the light
of fighting al-Qaeda is a gross misrepresentation. Yemens history is
deeply entwined with that of Arab nationalist politics in the Middle East,
adding to that a balance of imperial power in the region.
The location of modern Yemen is vital in the notion of Yemens significance
to imperial powers. Millennia ago, a settled civilization was established in
the fertile south-west region of Arabia, and was comprised by the kingdoms
of Main, Saba, and Himyar.
These kingdoms,
were significant in the broader history of
the Middle East, in part because of the long-distance trade links to
India and the states at the top of the Red Sea.[3]
When Islam arose:
Yemen became part of the Arab and Islamic
worlds and contributed both militarily to the Islamic conquests and
culturally to the mediaeval Islamic period. From the tenth century
onward, Yemen... ceased to be part of the broader Islamic empires...
[and] it was ruled by a succession of dynasties, controlling more or
less of to-days Yemeni territory.
The last of these to control most of
to-days North and South were the Qasimis, who ruled in the
mid-seventeenth century. In the early modern period, Yemen fell under
various degrees of external influence and control - in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the Dutch and the Portuguese yielding to the
Ottomans, and in the nineteenth century the Ottomans and the British
dividing the country between them.[4]
When the Ottomans left in 1918, following their
defeat in World War I, Zeidi Imam took over North Yemen, which was
run by the Imams, while South Yemen was controlled by the British.[5]
From the late eighteenth century, the British
being the dominant power in the Arabian Peninsula,
sought to protect its imperial
communications by entering into a series of treaties with the ruling
shaykhs of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman and by bringing the
strategic southern tip of the peninsula under direct British control as
the Aden Protectorate [South Yemen].[6]
Various families competed for power in Arabia,
with Abd al-Aziz Ibn Saud emerging victorious when in 1924 he exiled the
previously imposed leader (supported by the British, but highly unpopular),
Sharif Husayn.
Britain quickly negotiated an agreement with Ibn
Saud in 1927, called the Treaty of Jeddah, which,
recognized Ibn Saud as the sovereign king
of the Hijaz and sultan of Najd and its dependencies; he, in turn,
acknowledged Britains special relationships with the coastal rulers [of
the Arabian Peninsula] and pledged to respect their domains.
In 1932, the state became known as the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia.[7]
Following World War II, the United States became
the single greatest superpower and it overtook the colonial possessions of
the old European empires that collapsed prior to, during, and following
World War II.
In the Middle East:
New social and political forces emerged
after 1945 to challenge the old elites and demand reform. Among them
were pro-Soviet communist parties, but much more important and popular
were radical nationalist movements and independent groups of young army
officers determined to free their countries from lingering foreign
control and chart a new course toward development and greater social
justice.[8]
The Imams in North Yemen had begun laying claim
to all of natural Yemen, directly challenging British rule in the south.
In the 1940s,
there began to develop political
oppositions, to both the Imams in the North and the British in the
South.
The Free Yemeni movement in the North staged a
failed coup in 1948 to free the North from the authoritarian rule of the
Imams.[9]
Egypt saw the most significant upheavals in the immediate post-War years. In
1952, a group of junior military officers in the Egyptian Army orchestrated
a bloodless coup in which they overthrew the Egyptian Monarchy and Colonel
Abd al-Nasser took power, forming the Revolutionary Command
Council (RCC).
The RCCs primary political rival in Egypt was
the
Muslim Brotherhood, so when an
assassination attempt on Nasser took place in 1954, the RCC outlawed the
Brotherhood, arrested thousands of its members and executed several of its
leaders. Nasser was not only the primary progenitor of nationalism in the
region, but he was considered the exalted leader of the pan-Arab movement
for unity.
Nasser set up a Soviet arms deal in 1955, in which Egypt exchanged cotton
for Soviet military equipment, which dealt Nasser an impressive propaganda
effect among Arab peoples who saw it as a rebuff of the Anglo-American grip
on Egypt. Nasser, meanwhile, had been attempting to construct a dam at
Aswan, and sought funds to do so from the World Bank in 1955.
The
World Bank approved a loan package
(designed by the British and Americans), which would have required Egypt to
accept particular conditions of the loan. Nasser had not made a decision on
the package, when, in July of 1956, America announced it was withdrawing the
offer.[10]
On July 26, 1956, days following the loan withdrawal, Nasser announced the
nationalization of the Suez Canal, giving Nasser incredible support across
the Muslim and Arab worlds, as the Canal,
built with Egyptian labour but operated by
a French company and used as the lifeline of the British Empire, had
stood as a symbol of Western exploitation. [11]
On October 29, 1956, Israel, Britain and France
attacked Egypt, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was signed by Britain and
France on November 6, following the condemnation of the attack by both the
USSR and America.
The Suez Crisis, an Egyptian military defeat,
had become a political success for Nasser.[12]
In Yemen, the struggle of the Free Yemenis in the North waged on against
both the rule of the Imams in the North and the British in the South.
The Free Yemenis were largely influenced by the
Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt initially, but changed the rhetoric as the 1950s
changed the dynamic of politics in the region, with the rise of Arab
nationalism, and thus,
the predominant politics of the oppositions
in North and South was nationalistic, involving support not only for the
general goal of Arab unity but also for Yemeni unity.
Following the failed coup in 1948, the
opposition in the North was split between intellectuals and groups of
officers. In 1962, the officers overthrew the Imams and proclaimed the
Yemen Arab Republic.[13]
When this took place in the North, opposition spread to the countryside in
the South where a guerilla movement developed. Between 1963 and 1967, the
guerilla movement became a powerful force competing for power in Aden and
the countryside, and was split into two: a Nasser-influenced group and a
more radical Marxist National Liberation Front (NLF).
Nasser inserted himself into the Yemeni civil
war in 1962.
The deposed Imam of Yemen had escaped to the
mountains and rallied tribesmen to his cause, with significant support from
powerful regional monarchs (and staunch American allies), Saudi Arabia and
Jordan. So the new Yemeni regime turned to Nasser for assistance, and by
1965, close to 70,000 Egyptian troops were in Yemen fighting for the
military regime in power.
After several years of fighting rebels and
traversing harsh terrain, Egypt withdrew in 1968.[14]
During the civil war, the British were still holding onto their protectorate
in the South, and were still very much politically bruised by Nasser since
the Suez Crisis.
Thus, the British,
devised a scheme with Israels secret
service, the Mossad, to aid the anti-Nasser forces in Yemen by supplying
them with arms and financial help.
This effort was aided by the CIA, as well as
Saudi intelligence and the Iranian SAVAK.[15]
Throughout the 1960s, the United States rapidly
accelerated a program of military support for Saudi Arabia, which included a
$400 million Anglo-American air defense program, military bases,
infrastructure,
and a $100 million U.S. program to supply
Saudi Arabia with trucks and military transport vehicles.[16]
The aim was to weaken Egypt and Nasser through a
civil war in Yemen, with each side using various groups for their own
geopolitical ambitions.
In 1967, the National Liberation Front (NLF) came to power in South
Yemen, as the British left, and South Yemen became an independent state.
Subsequently, North and South Yemen supported opposition movements within
each others territory. In 1972, the two sides briefly went to war with one
another, when the North attempted to conquer the South with Saudi and Libyan
support.[17]
While Yemens civil war had seen Yemen divided
among itself, it had also become a regional conflict between Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.
Yet, when the radical Marxist NLF government
came to power in South Yemen in 1967, the NLF had pledged its support for
the overthrow of all the traditional monarchies in the Arabian Peninsula:
The Saudi regime thus faced two hostile
Yemens, both of them with radical governments, both of them supported by
the Soviet Union, and both of them committed to the establishment of
republican forms of rule. [Saudi] King Faysal responded to this danger
by mending fences with the northern Yemen Arab Republic and attempting
to foment discord between it and the Peoples Republic of the south.[18]
The situation Saudi Arabia faced to its south
created an impetus for the acceleration and growth of the Saudi armed
forces.
Thus, in the 1970s,
the Saudis allocated between 35 and 40
percent of their total annual revenues to defense and security
expenditures.
In 1970, the defense budget had increased to $2
billion; by 1976 it was $36 billion.[19]
In North Yemen, the radical left fought a guerilla war against the
government from 1978 until 1982, with support from South Yemen.
This movement in the North,
saw itself as the vanguard of a mass
movement that would bring about unity through overthrowing the military
and tribal forces dominating the country.[20]
The North Yemen government was not centralized,
and so lacked a strong measure of legitimacy.
During the 1970s, the President,
promoted closer ties with the South as part
of an attempt to strengthen the central government.[21]
Throughout the 1980s, closer ties between the
two nations were sought, and unity committees were established, but with
little if any success. Not until the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of
the Cold War in 1989-1990 was progress on unity made, when,
the internal weaknesses of both regimes led
them to agree to enter a provisional unification, which occurred in May
1990.[22]
Each state thought that they could exploit the
process of unification to exert their own authority over the other region.
Thus, unity was,
not a policy aimed at fusion but an
instrument for inter-regime competition.[23]
The North, in particular, believed it could
impose its will on the South, following the 1993 elections and through the
process of misleading negotiations.
Eventually, this goal started to be realized,
and,
Yemeni unity was thus achieved by the
successful imposition of the Northern regimes power on the South, in
alliance with both Islamists in the North, and with dissident exiles
from the South.[24]
However, these disagreements and problems,
led to a de facto split in the country in
early 1994, followed at the end of April by an outright Northern attack
on the South. On 7 July 1994 Northern forces entered Aden, thus
effectively unifying the country under one regime for the first time in
several centuries.[25]
Operation Scorched Earth
During the 1994 civil war in Yemen, the North was aided in its war against
the south by Wahhabist Sunni rebels (practicing the strict branch of Islam
common to Saudi Arabia as well as al-Qaeda).
Following the war and the success of the North,
the government had granted the Wahhabis a stronger voice in the government.
This is a major complaint of the Zaydis, a Shia branch of Islam. The Zaydis
had Saada as their main stronghold in the North, but were driven from power
in the 1962 revolution, left to a region that remained undeveloped.
Saudi Arabia drew increasingly worried about
having a rebellious group of Shia Islam fighters (the Houthi) so close to
their border, with the potential to stir up groups within Saudi Arabia
itself.[26]
In 2004, the Yemen government tried to arrest the leader, Hussein al-Houthi,
a Zaydi religious leader, which sparked fighting and the leader was
subsequently killed in an air strike, leaving the movement to be run by his
brothers. In 2004, between 500-1000 people were killed in the fighting. In
2005, the fighting continued, and an estimated 1,500 people were killed.
Fighting broke out again in 2007 between the
government and the rebels, in which hundreds of people were killed.[27]
In 2008, a Shia mosque was bombed during prayer
in the Northern stronghold of Saada, with the Yemen government blaming the
Shia rebels, who both denied responsibility and denounced the attack.[28]
This spurred on further clashes between the government and the rebels, so
that by late 2008, since the outbreak of fighting in 2004, between 3,700 and
5,500 militants and civilians had been killed in the fighting.[29]
In June of 2009, nine foreigners were kidnapped while having a picnic in
Saada,
the bodies of three of them, a South Korean
teacher and two German nurses were discovered. Five Germans, including
three children and a Briton, are still missing and their status is
unknown.
It was never determined who was behind the
kidnappings and murders, but the government blamed the Houthi rebels.
The Houthis in
turn blamed drug cartels in the region for the murders.
Yemen was faced simultaneously with a
secessionist movement in both the North and the South, and was reportedly
facing a,
greater threat from al-Qaeda, which had
been a growing concern of the United States.
In July of 2009, Gen. David Petraeus, CENTCOM
Commander,
and an accompanying delegation, flew to
Yemen and met with [President] Saleh, at which one of the topics of
discussion was how to better combat terrorism.
In August of 2009, Yemen launched a military
offensive against Houthi rebels in the North.[30]
This was Operation Scorched Earth, launched by the Yemen military on
August 11, 2009. Troops, tanks and fighter aircraft were used in this Yemeni
blitzkrieg against the Houthi and Zaydi in the North, with the President
vowing to crack down with an iron fist.[31]
This led to a refugee crisis in which, by October 2009, over 55,000 people
fled their homes due to the conflict.[32]
In November, the rebels had a border fight with
Saudi Arabia, killing a Saudi officer and injuring several others.[33]
Saudi Arabian warplanes and artillery bombarded a Shiite rebel stronghold,
and Saudi Arabia and Yemen were cooperating and sharing intelligence in the
fight.[34]
Moroccan special forces trained in guerilla
warfare were accompanying Saudi soldiers, and Morocco cut off relations with
Iran, which was being accused of arming the Houthi rebels.
Jordan also reportedly sent 2,000 of its own
special forces to help Saudi Arabia.[35]
The American Empire in
the Gulf of Aden and Africa
What is Americas particular interest in Yemen, and more broadly, in the
region that encompasses the Gulf of Aden, over which Yemen rests at the
pinnacle?
The Gulf of Aden connects the Red Sea to the
Arabian Sea, with Yemen positioned directly across the water from Somalia,
Djibouti and Eritrea. The Gulf of Aden is a vital transport route for the
shipment of Persian Gulf oil, forming an essential oil transport route
between Europe and the Far East.[36]
Clearly, control of the major oil transport
routes is a key strategic imperative of any global power; in this case,
America. Yemen, situated beneath Saudi Arabia, positions itself as even more
significant to American strategic initiatives, in securing their interests
in the worlds most oil-rich nation and key US ally. An American-friendly
government in Yemen is a Saudi-friendly government.
Another key facet of American imperial strategy in the Gulf of Aden and
Yemen regards the American imperial strategy in Africa.
In 2005, the Council on Foreign Relations
(CFR),
the main policy-planning group of the US elite, published a Task Force
Report on US strategy in Africa called, More
Than Humanitarianism: A Strategic U.S. Approach Toward Africa.
In the report, it was stated that:
Africa is becoming more important because of
its growing role in supplying the world with oil, gas, and non-fuel
minerals. Now supplying the United States with 15 percent of oil
imports, Africas production may double in the next decade, and its
capacity for natural gas exports will grow even more. In the next
decade, Africa could be supplying the United States with as much energy
as the Middle East.[37]
The report stated that,
The United States is facing intense
competition for energy and other natural resources in Africa,
identifying India and primarily China as its main competitors in the
search for these resources and for both economic and political influence
on the continent.[38]
In particular,
China presents a particularly important
challenge to U.S. interests.[39]
Further,
To compete more effectively with China, the
United States must provide more encouragement and support to
well-performing African states, develop innovative means for U.S.
companies to compete, give high-level attention to Africa, and engage
China on those practices that conflict with U.S. interests.[40]
In analyzing how the
War
on Terror had been brought to Africa, the report stated:
Post-9/11, the U.S. counter-terror approach
to Africa has been led by the U.S. military:
-
CENTCOM in the Horn
-
EUCOM in West, Central, and southern
Africa
-
the U.S. Special Operations Command
(SOCOM)
More quietly, U.S. intelligence cooperation
with key states has expanded in parallel with the enlargement of the
U.S. militarys role.[41]
As the Guardian reported in June of 2005,
a new scramble for Africa is taking place
among the world's big powers, who are tapping into the continent for its
oil and diamonds.
A key facet of this is that,
corporations from the US, France, Britain
and China are competing to profit from the rulers of often chaotic and
corrupt regimes.[42]
In May of 2006, the Washington Post reported
that in Somalia, the US has been,
secretly supporting secular warlords who
have been waging fierce battles against Islamic groups for control of
the capital, Mogadishu.[43]
In December of 2006, Ethiopia, heavily backed
and supported by the US, invaded and occupied Somalia, ousting the Islamist
government.
The US support for the operations was based upon
the claims of Somalia being a breeding ground for terrorists and Al-Qaeda.
However, this was has now turned into an insurgency.
Wired Magazine reported in December of
2008 that,
for several years the U.S. military has
fought a covert war in Somalia, using gunships, drones and Special
Forces to break up suspected terror networks - and enlisting Ethiopias
aid in propping up a pro-U.S. transitional government.[44]
Again, another case of America being on the
wrong side of a world revolution. The Ethiopian troops occupied Somalia
for a couple years, and in January of 2009, the last Ethiopian troops left
the capital city of Mogadishu.
In 2007, the UN authorized an African Union (AU)
peacekeeping mission in Somalia. In March of 2007, Ugandan military
officials landed in Somalia. Essentially, what this has done is that the
more overt Ethiopian occupation of Somalia has been replaced with a
UN-mandated African Union occupation of the country, in which Ugandan troops
make up the majority.
Since Uganda is a proxy military state for the
US in the region, the more overt US supported Ethiopian troops have been
replaced by a more covert US-supported Ugandan contingent.
Africom
In 2007, Newsweek reported that,
America is quietly expanding its fight
against terror on the African front. Two years ago the United States set
up the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership with nine countries in
central and western Africa.
There is no permanent presence, but the hope
is to generate support and suppress radicalism by both sharing U.S.
weapons and tactics with friendly regimes and winning friends through a
vast humanitarian program assembled by USAID, including well building
and vocational training.
The Pentagon announced the formation of a new
military strategic command called Africom
(Africa Command), which,
will integrate existing diplomatic,
economic and humanitarian programs into a single strategic vision for
Africa, bring more attention to long-ignored American
intelligence-gathering and energy concerns on the continent, and elevate
African interests to the same level of importance as those of Asia and
the Middle East.[45]
The article gave brief mention to critics,
saying that,
not surprisingly, the establishment of a
major American base in Africa is inspiring new criticism from European
and African critics of U.S. imperial overreach.
Some claim it represents a militarization of
U.S. Africa policy, which is not a stretch of the imagination, as the
article pointed out,
the United States has identified the Sahel,
a region stretching west from Eritrea across the broadest part of
Africa, as the next critical zone in the War on Terror and started
working with repressive governments in Chad and Algeria, among others,
to further American interests there.[46]
The article continued:
The problem is that, increasingly, African
leaders appear not to want Africom. They see it as the next phase of the
War on Terror - a way to pursue jihadists inside Africa's weak or failed
states, which many U.S. officials have described as breeding grounds for
terror. They worry that the flow of arms will overwhelm the flow of aid,
and that U.S. counterterrorism will further destabilize a region already
prone to civil wars.[47]
Ever since the 2007 US-supported air strikes and
invasion of Somalia, piracy has been a significant issue in the waters off
of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden.
In 2009, several major nations, including
America, Britain and China, sent navy ships into Somali waters to combat the
pirates who were negatively impacting trade through the region.
As Johann Hari explained in the
Independent:
In 1991, the government of Somalia
collapsed. Its nine million people have been teetering on starvation
ever since - and the ugliest forces in the Western world have seen this
as a great opportunity to steal the country's food supply and dump our
nuclear waste in their seas. Yes:
nuclear waste.
As soon as the government was gone,
mysterious European ships started appearing off the coast of Somalia,
dumping vast barrels into the ocean. The coastal population began to
sicken. At first they suffered strange rashes, nausea and malformed
babies. Then, after the 2005 tsunami, hundreds of the dumped and leaking
barrels washed up on shore. People began to suffer from radiation
sickness, and more than 300 died...
At the same time, other European ships have been looting Somalia's seas
of their greatest resource: seafood. We have destroyed our own fish
stocks by overexploitation - and now we have moved on to theirs. More
than $300m-worth of tuna, shrimp, and lobster are being stolen every
year by illegal trawlers. The local fishermen are now starving...
This is the context in which the "pirates"
have emerged. Somalian fishermen took speedboats to try to dissuade the
dumpers and trawlers, or at least levy a "tax" on them. They call
themselves the Volunteer Coastguard of Somalia - and ordinary Somalis
agree.
The independent Somalian news site
WardheerNews found 70 per cent "strongly supported the piracy as a
form of national defense".[48]
In 2009, an American Navy commander suggested
that the Somali pirates were in receivership of not only a great amount of
sympathy from Yemeni people (while the government would help combat the
piracy), but that,
private citizens in Yemen are selling
weapons, fuel and supplies to Somali pirates. And maritime experts worry
that pirates are increasingly able to find refuge along Yemen's vast
coast.
Some Yemeni officials,
suggest the extensive international
attention to piracy is just a pretext for big powers like the U.S. to
gain control of the Gulf of Aden, a waterway through which millions of
barrels of oil pass every day.
One member of the Yemeni Parliament suggested
that,
Western powers are allowing piracy to
continue as a way to serve their own interests.[49]
Al-Qaeda in Yemen
The current war in Yemen and US support for it is predicated on the basis of
aiding Yemen in the fight against al-Qaeda. S
aid Ali al-Shihri was arrested by the Americans
in 2001 in Afghanistan, and was promptly taken to Guantanamo Bay. The
Americans released him into Saudi custody in 2007, and he,
passed through a Saudi rehabilitation
program for former jihadists before resurfacing with Al Qaeda in Yemen.
In other words, the US handed him over to Saudi
Arabia, who enrolled him in a program for former jihadists, and then he
became the second in command in Al-Qaeda in Yemen.
As one American intelligence official stated,
he returned to Saudi Arabia in 2007, but
his movements to Yemen remain unclear.
One Saudi security official had reported (on
condition of anonymity) that,
Mr. Shihri had disappeared from his home in
Saudi Arabia [in 2008] after finishing the rehabilitation program.[50]
In June of 2009, US officials were reporting
that Al-Qaeda fighters were leaving Pakistan to go fight in Somalia and
Yemen.
The CIA, the Pentagon and the White House
reported that Al-Qaeda groups in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia were
communicating more frequently, and apparently trying to coordinate their
actions.
The CIA Director, Leon Panetta, said
that,
the United States must prevent Al Qaeda
from creating a new sanctuary in Yemen or Somalia.
Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Brookings Institution, a major US policy
think tank,
I am very worried about growing safe havens
in both Somalia and Yemen, specifically because we have seen Al Qaeda
leadership, some leaders, start to flow to Yemen.[51]
So the American national security establishment
had refocused its efforts on Yemen. War seemed inevitable.
In the 1980s, millions of Yemeni men had worked in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia, sending remittances back home to Yemen. In 1991, in the lead-up to
the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia viewed these migrant workers as a potential
security threat, so they expelled 800,000 Yemeni workers back to Yemen, and
henceforth, Yemeni labour was banned in Saudi Arabia.
Saudi financed Wahhabi madrasas sprung up
across Yemen, providing a place for the disenchanted and unemployed Yemeni
Sunni population to find an outlet for their political and economic
dislocation.
President Saleh of Yemen had often used
Yemeni Wahhabis,
to fight his domestic opponents - first the
communists, then the Zaidis, and then the H[o]uthis.[52]
In August of 2009, as the Saudi assault on the
Houthi rebels in the North was underway, a Houthi leader and brother to the
slain former leader, Yahya al-Houthi, spoke to a Middle Eastern news
agency. He was a former Yemeni Member of Parliament, who had fled to Libya,
and subsequently sought political asylum in Germany.
He told Press TV:
Saudi Arabia wants the regime of Ali
Abdullah Saleh to remain in power because he is meeting all the Saudi
demands especially those related to terrorism. Yemen is now a main party
in carrying out terrorist plots sponsored by Saudi Arabia, therefore it
is important for Saudi Arabia to keep Ali Abdullah Saleh in power as the
overthrow of his regime would lead to many big secrets being revealed.
The regime in Saudi Arabia also supports the
Wahhabi ideology and is trying to spread this ideology amongst our
people in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is also suffering from internal problems
which it wants to export to Yemen. Many members of al-Qaeda , Yemenis
and non Yemenis, are now in Yemen.
In recent months [Yemeni President] Ali
Abdullah Saleh has taken many recruits of Al-Qaeda who were afraid of
falling into the hands of their regimes in countries like Egypt,
Somalia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. His plan was to use these fighters
from al-Qaeda to battle the Houthis in Saada.
A training camp was also erected for these
terrorists which still exists today in the area of Waila. These members
of al-Qaeda and also Baathist elements are now taking part in the
fighting alongside the Yemeni army against the Houthis. The areas of
Malahit and Hasana which the Houthis have taken control over were used
to transfer weapons from Saudi Arabia to the terrorists.
These areas are also where most of the
terrorists' plans are made.[53]
In other words, according to al-Houthi, Yemen
(along with Saudi Arabia) are directly supporting the al-Qaeda contingent in
Yemen in an effort to sow chaos (thus providing a pretext for the military
assault), as well as aiding in the fight against the Houthis.
In October, as the fighting raged on, it was
reported that the Yemeni governor in the northern province had signed a
deal with al-Qaeda, in which the government,
would provide the militants with arms,
budget and other military requirements to assist the Yemeni army against
the Shia fighters.[54]
Saudi Arabia remains, as it did throughout the
entire history of the movement (since the 1980s), as the principle financier
of al-Qaeda.[55]
In fact, in 2009, it was revealed that members of the Saudi royal family
directly provide extensive financial support for al-Qaeda and other
extremist groups. The documents were revealed in a court case in which
families of victims of the September 11th attacks were seeking to bring
legal action against the Saudis for their financial support.
The documents were leaked to their lawyers, and
the US Justice Department stepped in (on behalf of the Saudis), and,
had the lawyers copies destroyed and now
wants to prevent a judge from even looking at the material.[56]
Clearly, al-Qaeda is not an organization
autonomous of Saudi financing.
The Southern
Secessionist Movement
Apart from simply the Houthis, the Saleh dictatorship seeks to suppress a
Southern Yemeni secessionist movement seeking autonomy and liberation
against the illegitimate central government.
Since 2007,
southern Yemenis have been staging mass
protests calling for reinstatement of southerners dismissed from the
civil service and army, higher pensions, a fairer share of the country's
dwindling national wealth, and an end to corruption.
The protests were met with,
severe repression by the security services,
which seemed to only spur on the demand for secession by the south,
where most of the country's oil is located.[57]
One Yemeni analyst stated that,
If there is one thing that will break the
country, its going to be the southern secession.
One southern secessionist activist stated that
Salehs government was using the pretext of al-Qaeda and its war on terror,
for the liquidation of the southern
movement, and that, the southern movement is trying to continue the
peaceful struggle. But the powers in Yemen have used excessive violence
against peaceful protests.
The government, for its part, has attempted to
propagate the baseless claim that the southern secessionists have links with
al-Qaeda.[58]
Interestingly, al-Qaedas leader in Yemen, in a recorded statement,
declared support for the Southern Movement,
but Southern leaders have thus far rejected his endorsement.[59]
In an interview with France24, former South
Yemen President, Ali Salem al-Beidh, explained that,
We have nothing to do with al Qaeda, we
have never been in contact with this organization. Our movement rejects
terrorism, which in contrast thrives in the north of the country.
President Ali Abdallah Saleh uses al Qaeda to scare westerners and the
United States.[60]
Salehs government has committed several human
rights abuses against the movement in the South, unlawfully and unjustly
killing innocents during protests, with the military surrounding peaceful
protests and opening fire.[61]
Mass protest in South
Yemen
The rapidly spreading protest movement in the South, explained the New
York Times,
now threatens to turn into a violent
insurgency if its demands are not met.
While the leaders of the movement favor peaceful
protest, the governments violent repression has made it so that,
their ability to control younger and more
violent supporters is fraying.
One southern leader stated,
We demand an independent southern republic,
and we have the right to defend ourselves if they continue to kill us
and imprison us.
Again refuting claims that the movement is tried
to al-Qaeda, the leaders,
say that they stand for law, tolerance and
democracy, and that it is the north that has a history of using
jihadists as proxy warriors.
A major problem arises within the Southern
movement in that it remains deeply divided, with no clear singular
leadership, drawing from an array of people, from socialists to Islamists,
with wildly different goals and unresolved
disputes.[62]
The Underwear Bomber
On December 25, 2009, a 23-year old Nigerian-born man named Umar Farouk
Abdulmutallab boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253, en route
from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan, when he tried to detonate plastic
explosives hidden in his underwear.
This incident, still shrouded in mystery,
provided the excuse for American involvement in the conflict in Yemen, as it
was reported that Farouk had been trained by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula (AQAP), the newly-formed Saudi and Yemeni al-Qaeda group.
However, how Farouk managed to get on the plane, let alone past security
with explosives on his person, is still an important question.
After all, America knew about Farouk for up to
two years prior to the incident, and even had him,
on a list that includes people with known
or suspected contact or ties to a terrorist or terrorist organization.[63]
Britains MI5 knew three years prior to the
incident that Umar had connections with Islamic extremists in Britain.[64]
Umars father, a former Nigerian government minister and successful
banker, had even warned the US Embassy in Nigeria of his sons extremist
beliefs.[65]
Umar even had a US entry visa, and when the
State Department stepped in to have his visa revoked,
intelligence officials asked [the State
Department] not to deny a visa to the suspected terrorist over concerns
that a denial would've foiled a larger investigation into al-Qaida
threats against the United States.[66]
Suddenly, there was a flurry of reports from
respected
newspapers (such as the Washington Post and New York
Times propaganda rags), that this failure of following through with
the intelligence that was available on Umar meant that a review of security
was needed, both in terms of possibly expanding the watch lists and in
terms of expanding airport security, and proposing the use of body-scanners.
Several politicians and news-rags were also
calling for expanded military operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and
Somalia.[67]
Interestingly, there were several reports of eyewitnesses on board the plane
who contradict the official account of Umars attempted terrorist act.
An attorney on board the plane said that,
he saw another man come to the assistance
of accused bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab when he tried to board the
airplane in Amsterdam without a passport.
The attorney and his wife had both seen this
incident.
The wife, also a lawyer, stated,
My husband noticed two men walk up to the
ticket counter lady. The only reason he noticed them is that he thought
they were really a mismatched pair.
She said that Umar,
wore older, scraggly clothing, but the man
who was assisting him, who appeared to be of Indian descent, was dressed
in what looked like an expensive suit and shoes.
She recounted that the well-dressed man had told
the ticket agent,
We need to get this man on the plane, and
that, He doesnt have a passport.
The ticket agent responded that no one was
allowed to board the plane without a passport, to which the Indian man
replied,
We do this all the time; hes from Sudan.[68]
Yet no further information has come forward
about this mysterious second man who helped Umar board the plane.
Nevertheless, the propaganda of this attempted
terrorist attack had taken effect, as people were again afraid of the
menace of Islamic terror and al-Qaeda, and the U.S. got the pretext to
justify its intervention in Yemen.
American Imperialism
in Yemen
While the Underwear Bomber was used as a propaganda vehicle for supporting
direct US military intervention in Yemen, covert US military involvement in
Yemen had already been underway for some time (as well as British).
In 2002, a mere six months
following 9/11, President
Bush authorized the deployment of 100 US troop to Yemen,
to help train that nation's military to
fight terrorists.
The troops,
would consist predominantly of Special
Forces, but could also include intelligence experts and other
specialists. The main target would be Al Qaeda fighters who are hiding
in Yemen.[69]
In September of 2002, it was reported that the
United States was deploying Special Forces and CIA agents into the Horn of
Africa in an effort to combat al-Qaeda in Yemen, and,
800 US special forces have been moved to
Djibouti, which faces Yemen.[70]
In November of 2002, a CIA Predator drone
(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - UAV) launched an attack on an al-Qaeda target
within Yemen, killing six suspected al-Qaeda members, one of whom was an
American citizen.[71]
Prior to the Underwear Bomber (as he has come to be known), the conflict
in Yemen was primarily viewed as a civil war, and then with the
participation of Saudi Arabia, as a regional Arab conflict. In September of
2009, it was reported that while the Yemeni government attempted to subdue a
rebel Shia army in the north (Houthi), a refugee crisis was emerging, and a
wider conflict was erupting, which could suck the US into another sensitive
conflict zone.
Many observed that if the US manages to stay out
of the war,
the conflict might be subsumed in a
regional war by proxy, as in, through Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia,
further, was accusing Iran of supporting the Shia rebels in northern
Yemen, with both money and arms, but Saudi Arabia has produced no hard
evidence.
From the time the Saudi assault on northern
Yemen began in August of 2009, between 25,000 and 100,000 Yemeni refugees
were displaced.
One top official with the World Food Program
(WFP) stated that,
We're not confronted with a humanitarian
crisis, it's becoming a humanitarian tragedy.[72]
A member of the International Crisis Group
(ICG)
said,
that the United States might be forced to
intervene as the security situation worsened to prevent Yemen becoming a
failed state.
Further,
the country has been used as an al-Qaeda
base before, and its strategic location between the oil supply routes of
the Gulf and the piracy haven of Somalia means its stability is regarded
as a key western interest.
Thus, said the ICG analyst,
You might well see American advisers, maybe
even some special troops, go in for special operations. President Obama
declared in September of 2009 that, the security of Yemen is vital for
the security of the United States.[73]
In November of 2009, it was reported that a,
delegation of military officers from Yemen
arrived in the United States recently for training, of which the
purpose, was to familiarize the Yemeni military officers with formal
training programs currently in use by the United States Marine Corps.
Support to Yemeni military officer training is likely to increase the
effectiveness of [Yemens] military force.[74]
On December 13, 2009, (less than two weeks prior
to the Underwear Bomber incident), it was reported that,
US special forces have been sent to Yemen
to train its army amid fears the unstable Arab state is becoming a
strategically important base for al-Qaeda.[75]
It would appear, then, that the Underwear
Bomber incident arrived just in time for the United States to have an
excuse to expand its war in the region.
Without the propagandized attempted terrorist
attack, the American public would not readily accept Americas entry into
yet another war. Questions might be asked about the nature of the war, such
as the US supporting the government of Yemen in its suppression and
oppression of its own people and the autonomous movements developing within
Yemen seeking change.
Whereas with a terrorist attack (or attempted,
rather), and the convenient link to al-Qaeda, which suddenly was reported to
be heavily represented in Yemen, Americans see their involvement in Yemen as
a war against al-Qaeda, and a necessary one at that.
Two days after the Underwear Bomber incident took place, the New York
Times reported that,
in the midst of two unfinished major wars,
the United States has quietly opened a third, largely covert front
against Al Qaeda in Yemen. In 2008, the Central Intelligence Agency
sent several of its top field operatives with counterterrorism
experience to the country, and simultaneously, some of the most
secretive Special Operations commandos have begun training Yemeni
security forces in counterterrorism tactics.
Further:
The Pentagon is spending more than $70
million over the next 18 months, and using teams of Special Forces, to
train and equip Yemeni military, Interior Ministry and coast guard
forces, more than doubling previous military aid levels.[76]
It was even reported that the US had been
providing both intelligence and fire power to Yemen in its air strikes
against suspected al-Qaeda targets throughout December, prior to the
Underwear Bomber.[77]
The New York Times did its part to
propagandize the al-Qaeda issue by stating that,
al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has
rapidly evolved into an expanding and ambitious regional terrorist
network thanks in part to a weakened, impoverished and distracted Yemeni
government.[78]
Naturally, the British were not far behind in
supporting an imperialist campaign to crush indigenous movements for
autonomy, directed against western-supported dictators.
After all, the British have been doing this for
centuries. Roughly one week following the attempted Detroit plane bomber
story broke, it was reported that the UK sent counter-terrorist forces to
Yemen, where they will train the Yemeni military,
and will assist in planning operations
against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
The British media referred to Yemen as the
ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, and had revealed, perhaps
unsurprisingly, that:
Even before the attack, Britain quietly sent
a military unit, believed to be about 30-strong and include members of
the SAS, to train and mentor Yemeni forces in surveillance and strike
operations, intelligence gathering, hostage rescue and interrogation
techniques. It is understood that the detachment is being assisted by
members of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6.[79]
There further seems to be an effort to not only
use al-Qaeda to advance US interests in the region, but also to draw a link
to Iran, so as to further demonize Iran and even draw it into a regional
war.
Pushing for a Proxy
War With Iran
Government officials in Yemen had been declaring that the greatest threat to
Yemens security comes not from al-Qaeda, but Iran, as they blame Iran,
for fermenting the Shia rebellion, and the
chairman of Yemens national security agency stated that, there are
indeed signs, proof of Iranian interference.
While these allegations are made without any
proof,
Western diplomats claim it is probable that
Iran is providing money or materiel to the group, as it has to Hizbollah
in Lebanon.[80]
In November of 2009, when Saudi Arabia had
stepped up its military campaign in Yemen, the New York Times reported that,
the border skirmish could lead to the
realization of Saudi Arabias worst fear: a proxy conflict with its
archrival, Iran, on its doorstep.
Quoting a Yemeni professor as saying that the
Iran link to the Houthis was a myth, the Saudi assault against the Shia
group could provoke Iran to turn myth into reality:
A battle between the Arab worlds leading
Sunni power and Shiite Iran, even at one remove, could significantly
elevate sectarian tensions across the region. Iran gained tremendous
leverage over the Israeli-Palestinian problem by supporting the militant
groups Hezbollah, in Lebanon, and Hamas, in Gaza. Helping the Houthis,
another guerrilla group with great staying power, could give them a way
to put pressure on Saudi Arabia.[81]
However, even as the New York Times
acknowledged, the idea that
the Houthis
are more religiously aligned to Iran than the Arab Gulf nations is a
misnomer, as the Houthi religion of
Zaydism is doctrinally closer to Sunnism
than to mainstream Shiism.[82]
However, facts take a back seat to war
propaganda.
On December 18, 2009, roughly one week before the Underwear Bomber, Time
Magazine ran an article in which they reported on the claims of Yemen and
Saudi Arabia that the Houthis,
are receiving their funding, weapons and
training from Iran in a bid to destabilize the region.
While acknowledging that there is no evidence of
Iranian involvement, the Time article was entitled, Yemen's
Hidden War: Is Iran Causing Trouble?
and the last sentence in the article wrote,
As for Iran - the only party that doesn't
seem to have any real involvement just yet - the time may soon be ripe
to jump in.[83]
The Washington Post carried an article entitled,
Yemen denounces Iran's 'interference', yet only in the final paragraph of
the article did they report,
Yemen has accused Iran of funneling arms
and providing financial backing to the rebels, but the Yemeni government
has not provided evidence to support the assertions. The rebels have
insisted that they receive no support from Iran or any other foreign
powers.[84]
Saudi and Yemeni media and government propaganda
presented a view that Iran was extensively involved in the internal conflict
in Yemen.
Yemen had seized an Iranian ship which it
claimed was transporting weapons to Houthi rebels, while Saudi papers
reported that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps was training the Houthi
rebels.
Another Saudi media outlet,
reported that a dozen Hezbollah fighters
from Lebanon were killed during battles in October, and Saudi Arabia
placed blame for the conflict on Iran, saying that the insurgents are
working for Tehran and [are] wanting to take their front to the Saudi
border.[85]
While there has been no actual evidence of
Iranian involvement put forward, the situation could become a
self-fulfilling prophecy of the Saudis and Yemenis, in the sense that the
more they accuse Iran of involvement, the more they demonize and publicly
lambaste Iran, the more likely it is that Iran will be drawn into the
conflict.
If they are already the target of a campaign
aimed at blaming their alleged involvement for creating the crisis, what do
they have to lose from entering the conflict? Thus, Yemen could possibly
become a battleground for a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Regardless of whether or not the Iranians are or
will be physically involved in the conflict, it has resulted in a war of
rhetoric between both Saudi Arabia and Iran, further inflaming tensions
between the two nations.[86]
In January of 2010, General David Petraeus, commander of US Forces in
the Middle East, said that,
the domestic conflict in Yemen could become
a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
He explained that,
it is not a proxy war now, but has the
potential to become one, and there may already have been some movement
in that direction.[87]
There was even a pathetic attempt on the part of
the Washington Times to link Iran to al-Qaeda.[88]
Obviously, the Washington Times seemed to
be blithely unaware of the fact that Iran is a Shia dominated state, which
is religiously and ideologically opposed to al-Qaeda, which practices a
strict Wahhabist Sunni brand of Islam, as propagated and practiced by Saudi
Arabia, a major regional antagonist of Irans.
To claim that there would be a link between Iran
and al-Qaeda is simply to proclaim ones own ignorance. No wonder then, that
Senator John McCain, while on the campaign trail for President in 2008, so
often proclaimed his ignorance by several times making the claim that Iran
was supporting al-Qaeda.[89]
Could the United States be seeking to foment a wider war in the region?
Could the civil war in Yemen be expanded into a proxy-war against Iran?
Well, the United States (with the participation
of several other NATO partners) fueled the proxy war in the last civil war,
where the target was Nasserist Egypt. Could the US simply be employing the
same strategy today as they were then, with simply a change of target?
To understand this answer, we must look to the
direct role played by the United States in the Yemeni civil war.
America Wages War on
Yemen
Over a week prior to the underwear bomber fiasco, on December 16, 2009,
the United States reportedly,
perpetrated an appalling massacre against
citizens in the north of Yemen as it launched air raids on various
populated areas, markets, refugee camps and villages along with Saudi
warplane, according to the Houthi fighters.
Over 120 people were reported to have been
killed in the US bombing.[90]
The Houthi rebels have even reported that U.S.
fighter jets have launched 28 attacks on the northwestern province of
Sa'ada.[91]
On December 21, 2009, days before the underwear bomber pretext, ABC news
reported that the US had begun launching cruise missile attacks in Yemen
under the authorization of President Obama, and the French media reported on
one such strike having massacred 49 civilians, among them 23 children and
17 women.
While the air strikes were reportedly undertaken
to target al-Qaeda in Yemen, they took place in the south near where some of
the leaders of the secessionist movement were reportedly living.
These raids had been increasingly taking place,
and as the New York Times reported,
the United States provided firepower,
intelligence and other support to the government of Yemen as it carried
out raids.[92]
Over 2009, the Pentagon supplied the Yemeni
military with $70 million, effectively subsidizing their military (as they
do with a plethora of nations worldwide, most notably Colombia, Israel,
Egypt and Saudi Arabia), in order for Yemens military to be more able to
crush the secessionist uprising in the South, the rebels in the North, and
that pesky al-Qaeda which rears its head in any nation America seeks to
conduct military operations in.
As Newsweek reported in late December of 2009:
Over the past year U.S. and Yemeni interests
have increasingly begun to align as Al Qaeda's presence in the country
has grown.
"We started seeing a lot of foreign
fighters coming in - Saudis, Pakistanis," says one Yemeni diplomatic
source.
Many of those have arrived (or returned)
from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.
As they have, the networks of militants have
begun to launch quiet, pinpoint strikes on local Yemeni intelligence
chiefs - six or seven in the past several months alone. The government's
retaliatory raids were launched partly in response to those strikes...
Government raids are almost certainly the products of close cooperation
with the U.S. - perhaps carried out by CIA-operated Predator drones
launched from nearby Djibouti.
A. A. Al-Eryani, a former Yemeni prime
minister who advises the current president, says that there is "complete
intelligence cooperation" with the U.S. on counterterrorism.[93]
In other words, as the US brought in key
Pakistani and Saudi assets (who themselves make up both the financial and
operational arms of al-Qaeda), al-Qaeda militants began to emerge and launch
strikes against Yemen.
Suddenly, then, a pretext for US military
involvement in the nation is delivered in the guise of fighting the War
on Terror.
Just as during the Cold War, the threat of
Communism was used to rally support for suppressing and waging war against
national liberation movements all across the world, so now these movements
are suppressed and waged war against under the guise of fighting terror.
An odd irony of history, then, that in order to fight terror, the West
simply spreads it.
On December 29th, 2009, the Australian reported that,
the Americans have quietly opened a third,
largely covert front against the al-Qa'ida terror network in Yemen, to
combat a new generation of militants keen on transforming the country
into a launching pad for jihad against the US, its Arab allies and
Israel.
Besides the blatant propagandizing in the
opening sentence, the first part reveals the fact of a new secret war that
America is waging.
The article explained that a year previous,
CIA sent many of its top field operatives
with counter-terrorism experience to the country, while some of the most
secretive US special operations commandos began training Yemeni security
forces in counter-terrorism tactics.[94]
As US Senator Joe Lieberman proclaimed,
Iraq was yesterday's war. Afghanistan is
today's war. If we don't act pre-emptively, Yemen will be tomorrow's
war.
Barbara Bodine, the former US Ambassador
to Yemen, said that,
I think it would be a major mistake to turn
this into a third front, if Iraq and Afghanistan are somehow front
number one and number two. She explained, If we try to deal with this
as an American security problem and dealt with by American military, we
risk exacerbating the problem.
She astutely observed the nature of occupational
forces when she warned,
If we go in and make this our war... it is
suddenly going to become a war against us and we will lose it.[95]
The United States took it upon itself to press
the Yemeni government - a hard-line oppressive dictatorship - to toughen
its approach.[96]
In February of 2010, U.S. Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates approved,
more than doubling U.S. funding to train
and equip Yemeni security forces to combat al Qaeda at a figure of $150
million, up from $67 million the previous year. However, the sum does
not include covert U.S. assistance for Yemen, which has quietly
increased in recent months.
U.S. CIA Director Leon Panetta, however,
raised doubts as to whether Washington can count on Yemen in the long-term
to fight al-Qaeda.[97]
Covertly, the United States had increased
assistance to Yemen through U.S. Special Forces, the CIA and the National
Security Agency,
sharing satellite and surveillance imagery,
intercepted communications and other sensitive information to help Yemen
pinpoint strikes against al Qaeda targets,[98] or at least
what are said to be al-Qaeda targets, but usually end up as civilian
casualties.
In April of 2010, it was announced that the
Pentagon had implemented plans to,
boost U.S. military assistance to Yemens
special operations forces to lead an offensive targeting al-Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, providing roughly $34 million in tactical
assistance to Yemens special forces.
A further $38 million will provide Yemen with
military transport aircraft.[99]
As the United States has dramatically increased CIA drone attacks in
Pakistan, killing thousands of innocent civilians,[100] in May of
2010, the United States announced that it had deployed drones to Yemen to
target al-Qaeda.[101]
In June of 2010, it was leaked that the U.S.
secret war has expanded globally, as,
Special Operations forces have grown both
in number and budget, and are deployed in 75 countries, compared with
about 60 at the beginning of 2009.
As the Washington Post reported:
In addition to units that have spent years
in the Philippines and Colombia, teams are operating in Yemen and
elsewhere in the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia...
Plans exist for preemptive or retaliatory
strikes in numerous places around the world, meant to be put into action
when a plot has been identified, or after an attack linked to a specific
group... Obama, one senior military official said, has allowed "things
that the previous administration did not."
Special Operations commanders have also
become a far more regular presence at the White House than they were
under
George W. Bush's administration,
when most briefings on potential future operations were run through the
Pentagon chain of command and were conducted by the defense secretary or
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"We have a lot more access," a second
military official said. "They are talking publicly much less but
they are acting more. They are willing to get aggressive much more
quickly."
...Bush-era clashes between the Defense and
State departments over Special Operations deployments have all but
ceased.
Former defense secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld saw them as an independent force, approving in some
countries Special Operations intelligence-gathering missions that were
so secret that the U.S. ambassador was not told they were underway. But
the close relationship between Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is said to have smoothed out
the process...
In every place, Special Operations forces
activities are coordinated with the U.S. ambassador and are under the
operational control of the four-star regional commander.[102]
The British are also involved in supporting the
conflict in Yemen.
In July of 2010, the head of Yemens Special
Forces met with a British military delegation, in which,
aspects of bilateral military cooperation
between Yemen and the UK were discussed in addition to training, and
ways to benefit from British military expertise to bolster the military
and security capabilities of Yemens armed forces.[103]
In May of 2010, an air strike took place, which
was reported to have killed al-Qaeda militants, in a secret mission by the
U.S. military.
However,
the strike, it turned out, had also killed
the province's deputy governor, a respected local leader who Yemeni
officials said had been trying to talk al-Qaida members into giving up
their fight.[104]
As the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported,
that would be the equivalent of some
foreign military force killing the lieutenant governor of an American
state in an air strike. Further, the U.S. attacks have had no apparent
impact on al-Qaida or on anyone else in Yemen, apart from its civilian
population who have taken casualties in badly targeted attacks.
Commenting on the fact that US Special Forces
operations in Afghanistan, Algeria, Iran, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Tajikistan and Yemen, the reporter asks some
important questions:
Why is Mr. Saleh our ally? Why are we
killing innocent civilians in the back country of Yemen? Why are we
stirring up the kind of trouble that can end up trashing Yemen the way
we have trashed Iraq and Afghanistan? Does anyone believe for one minute
that we are any safer for all that we are doing in those 12 countries --
probably more -- than we would be if we had normal, mutually respectful,
mutually helpful relations with them?[105]
The questions are surprising to see being asked
in the American media, as the rest of the corporate controlled media outlets
simply report (without questioning) the government line, and explain that
the U.S. has decided to expand the drone attacks in Yemen, which,
would likely be modeled after the CIA's
covert drone campaign in Pakistan, and that the Obama administration
will mount a more intense targeted killing program in Yemen, without
questioning who they are killing.
As Glenn Greenwald of Salon Magazine
pointed out:
There is anti-Americanism and radicalism in
Yemen; therefore, to solve that problem, we're going to bomb them more
with flying killer robots, because nothing helps reduce anti-American
sentiments like slaughtering civilians and dropping cluster bombs from
the sky...
And it's therefore unsurprising that the
2009 Nobel 'Peace' laureate [Obama] is rapidly becoming as disliked in
the Muslim world as the prior U.S. President: what looks to five
Norwegians sitting in Oslo to be a 'Man of Peace' looks much different
in the region where his bombs are falling, his hit squads deploying, his
war commitments expanding, and his sky robots multiplying.[106]
In September of 2010, it was reported that the
Pentagon was considering expanding Yemens military assistance to $1.2
billion over the next five years, but dont worry,
the US is also providing significant
development and humanitarian assistance to Yemen.[107]
The Cleansing of a
Liberation Movement
A mass protest in Southern
Yemen
In September 2010, while the Obama
administrations top counter-terrorism official, John Brennan, was in Yemen
for talks with President Saleh, Yemeni security forces laid siege to a
town in the South, Hawta,
where several dozen Qaeda militants were
said to be holed up, which led to thousands of civilians being forced
to flee, while the military, as the New York Times reported, was
intermittently shelling the town with tanks and artillery and firing on
the jihadists from attack helicopters.
As the article explained:
Hawta, in southern Yemens mountainous
Shabwa Province, is at the heart of the remote area east and south of
the capital where Al Qaedas regional arm has sought sanctuary. It is
also just to the north of a major new liquid natural gas pipeline - a
crucial resource in a country that is rapidly running out of oil and
water - and Yemeni officials have voiced concern about the possibility
that jihadists could rupture the line.[108]
In other words, the Yemeni government, under
intense pressure and support from the United States, is laying siege to a
town in the South - in the midst of a massive and growing secessionist
movement - which represents the greatest threat to the stability of the
staunch U.S.-ally, and which also happens to be home to natural gas
reserves.
But we are told that the siege is a fight
against al-Qaeda. Meanwhile, civilians were being killed, and one fleeing
family said that,
the troops did not spare any one from their
fire over the past two days.[109]
The reality of what is going on in the village
is hard to know, as NPR points out,
because the government is banning any
independent observers from going in there.
As a reporter with NPR explained:
In fact, what the locals are saying is that
this is a blood feud against the government. And that, in fact, these
are local or armed tribesmen [i.e., Islamist forces such as Al-Qaeda in
the Arabian Peninsula - AQAP] that are sort of fighting with the
government. And that this is more about fighting or subduing the
secessionist movement than it is about al-Qaida...
The government says about 2,000 people have
fled. But actually, the Yemen Red Crescent and other aid groups that
have had some contact with the people on the ground there put the
numbers much higher. They say about 12,000. And that would be about
three-quarters of the town emptying out and running away.
And this has created a real problem, because this is a very poor area.
And so the other villages in the area cannot really accommodate or
absorb these refugees. And so, you have a lot of people, now, living
outdoors without any water, food or tents or any sort of medical, 'cause
one can assume that there are probably injuries, if not deaths.
So it's become a real humanitarian crisis.[110]
Yemens government is not new to media
censorship and obfuscation, as there have been,
dozens of extralegal abductions,
politicized trials, illegal confiscations, writing bans, and censorship
over the years. What's particularly alarming is a recent legislative
push to erect an elaborate legal facade to obscure repressive tactics.
The government is also attempting to pass,
a repressive bill designed to regulate
television, radio and online media. If passed, these changes would
significantly reduce an already narrow margin for free expression.
The government has even arrested, tortured and
tried critical journalists as supporting al-Qaeda with absolutely no
evidence.[111]
The Friends of Yemen
- Democratic Imperialism and NGOs as Modern Missionaries
In January of 2010, a group of nations and organizations met in London to
form the Friends of Yemen, which includes the United States, U.K., 20
other countries, as well as the UN, EU, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Arab
League, World Bank and IMF.
The purpose of the group was to coordinate
foreign aid to Yemen, so that it coincides with military, economic and civil
assistance aid programs, including forcing Yemen to cooperate with the
conditions set by
the IMF in order to receive foreign aid.
The overall aid would be used to combat what the
Friends refer to as appalling indicators, which include,
a growing population, dwindling oil
reserves, water shortages and political instability as the government
battles Houthi insurgents in the north and secessionists in the south.[112]
In September of 2010, the Friends of Yemen met
in New York to organize a plan for Yemens foreign aid. As part of the
package, Yemen has been forced to accept an IMF plan to increase taxes by
10% and to eliminate fuel subsidies.[113]
At the meeting in New York, the UN reported that
there are,
168,000 Somali refugees in Yemen, as well
as 304,000 Yemeni civilians who continue to be displaced by the
seven-month conflict between government forces and Houthis rebels which
ended with a shaky truce in February.[114]
The Friends further encouraged,
progress in the negotiations towards
Yemens accession to the World Trade Organization, which they hoped
would be concluded by the end of 2010, and while acknowledging that the
proposed economic reforms would have an adverse impact on the poor,
the Friends thus committed to provide additional support for social
protection, as well as supporting the formation of national multi-party
elections.[115]
At the Friends meeting, the United States
vowed to commit $67 million for the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID),
to work in partnership with communities to
directly address local needs. This includes health, education, and water
projects; mobile health and veterinary clinics; and support for
increasing the capacity of local governments to deliver essential
services.
Further plans include funneling millions of
dollars through NGOs aimed at providing social services and poverty
alleviation programs.[116]
While sounding very pleasant and helpful, we must place the concept of
promoting democratization and the spread of NGOs in their proper
geopolitical context. The fact that NGOs, democratization, economic
programs under the direction of the IMF, and military assistance from the
West are taking place at the same time is very significant, and not as
contradictory as it might seem.
In Africa, the IMF and World Banks Structural Adjustment Programs that
deconstructed society to service illegitimate debts to Western banks had the
effect of spreading poverty and effectively induced social genocide.
The national leaders became very rich, creating
a tiny elite which was subservient to Western imperial interests. Western
nations would arm the nation and use it as a proxy force in the region when
necessary or help it in the oppression of its own people, in order to ensure
the stability of their interests.
The people of these various nations would
protest, demonstrate, riot and rebel, so much so that between 1976 and 1992,
there were 146 protests against IMF austerity measures in 39 countries
around the world.[117]
Governments, in response, would generally resort
to violence to suppress these demonstrations, with,
strikes declared illegal, universities were
closed, and trade unions, student organizations, popular organizations
and political parties also became the target of repressive legislation
or actions.[118]
This essentially created a crisis of
legitimacy, where the economic reforms were seen as destructive, where
the political process was seen as corrupt, where the state oppressed and
foreigners profited, while the people suffered.
It didnt help the situation that it was often
authoritarian governments introducing these economic reforms.[119]
In 1989, the World Bank concluded that the reason for the failure of
structural adjustment across Africa was not due to the destructive
poverty-inducing nature of the reforms, but was do to the corrupt
governments implementing them. Thus, it was a crisis of governance.[120]
The solution, in this sense, was to promote
democratization, as in, a neoliberal concept of democracy. Africa
had been experiencing a growth of democratic movements around the continent
during the time of Structural Adjustment, which led the
IFIs (International Financial Institutions)
and Western nations to conclude that democratization and economic
liberalization go hand-in-hand.
In short, Structural Adjustment is
inherently democratic. The failure of this analysis was quite obvious: the
pro-democracy movements that had arisen across Africa,
reflect, to a significant extent, a popular
reaction against the socially painful effects of structural adjustment.[121]
The democratization movement is largely an
effort to maintain stability in the hegemony of the IMF/World Bank and
Western interests over Africa and other regions, as instead of rotating from
one coup to another, there is a parliamentary democracy where you go from
one party to another (who all accept the dominance of the West and the
advice of the IFIs), which produces a more stable environment for
Western interests, as it also has the effect of pacifying popular opposition
under the guise of promoting democratic accountability.
However, these are not true democracies (nor are
those in the West), where you simply vote between competing factions of
elites who are collectively co-opted by the same international financial
elites.
They impose the institutions of democracy
(legislatures, political parties, judiciaries),
without combining political democracy and
social reform.
Thus, these democracies are essentially
stillborn (dead before they even exited), as,
formal democracy without social reform
increases economic inequality and thereby intensifies unequal
distribution of power in society.[122]
As Noam Chomsky has argued,
the guardians of world order have sought to
establish democracy in one sense of the term, while blocking it in a
different sense. He argued that power holders use democracy as
justification for their power and as an ideological instrument for
keeping the public quiescent and out of decision-making processes.[123]
Alison Ayers analyzes democratization
as a multi-faceted approach in Africa, entailing: multiparty elections,
constitutionalism, the rule of law, a particular conception of human
rights, good governance, and an independent civil society.[124]
Multiparty elections comprise an occasional
election in which people choose between competing factions of elites, while
constitutionalism implies establishing a set of rules securing property
rights, governing civil and commercial behavior, and limiting the power of
the state.[125]
In promoting multiparty systems,
the dominant agents of the democratization
project have established a veritable elections industry comprising
voter and civic education campaigns, party-building activities, and
electoral assistance and monitoring.[126]
The engineering of civil society has taken on
an explicitly neo-liberal form, in which it focuses on the liberation of
civil society from the state, and of which NGOs (non-governmental
organizations) have come to play a decisive role.
Western aid agencies heavily finance
international and local NGOs (thus often negating the notion that they are
non-governmental), with the World Bank exponentially increasing its support
of NGOs (often through governments).[127]
In fact, NGOs have come to play a pivotal role in the modern imperial
project, as they have been co-opted into a program of,
welfare provision, a social initiative that
could be more accurately described as a program of social control.[128]
The NGOs were used to respond to the social
upheaval brought about by the age of Structural Adjustment, to provide a
degree of social services that were formerly provided by the state.
Thus, as the spread of Structural Adjustment
increased throughout Africa, so too did the spread of Western NGOs. Western
nations heavily support these supposed non-governmental organizations, with
the U.S. transferring nearly 40 percent of its aid through NGOs.[129]
They have become an essential aspect of the
development agenda in Africa, itself based upon a colonial mindset.
Whereas in the formal colonial period at the end of the 19th and beginning
of the 20th century, Africans were considered uncivilized, and so
colonialism in Africa was not about oppression and economic exploitation,
but was rather a civilizing mission.
Today, Africa is not uncivilized but rather,
undeveloped, and so, just as the missionaries of the formal colonial
period played a role in civilizing Africa - in the vision of the West
(akin to how God created man in his own image) - the NGOs of the new
imperial era have come to Africa in a developing mission.
The development paradigm had the effect of
sterilizing popular opposition, as it framed the problem in Africa not as
one of emancipation (from colonial and oppressive powers), but as a
problem of poverty and basic needs.[130]
The role of NGOs in development:
Represents a continuity of the work of their
precursors, the missionaries and voluntary organizations that cooperate
in Europes colonization and control of Africa. Today their work
contributes marginally to the relief of poverty, but significantly to
undermining the struggle of African people to emancipate themselves from
economic, social and political oppression.[131]
There are further concerns to take into account
in regards to democratization and aid through NGOs, not simply in the
establishment of a system of lobotomizing resistance - preventing
emancipation - and promoting the legitimization of the status quo powers (by
treating the symptoms of poverty and oppression rather than the causes), but
NGOs and democratization often play a very covert role in imperialism,
particularly through USAID (United States Agency for International
Development) as well as a host of so-called Non-Governmental Organizations
(which happen to be funded by the government), such as the National
Endowment for Democracy.
These organizations are effectively able to
organize opposition to a national ruler, create a parallel media system,
provide activist training and funding to covertly orchestrate a soft power
coup, in which it is seen as a democratic revolution or a peaceful
revolution, often following contested elections.
This is done to create the illusion that these
are popular peoples movements elevating leaders of change, but which
simply are leaders that are subservient to Western imperial interests.
Often, the CIA itself operates through such agencies covertly.
In South Vietnam for example, USAID provided cover for the CIA so
extensively,
that the two became almost synonymous.[132]
In the 1980s, during the largest CIA covert
operation in history, funding the Afghan Mujahideen to fight the Soviet
Union, the CIA and USAID worked very closely, coordinating their efforts,
as,
the United States spent millions of dollars
to supply Afghan schoolchildren with textbooks filled with violent
images and militant Islamic teachings, part of covert attempts to spur
resistance to the Soviet occupation.
The textbooks, made in America at the University
of Nebraska with tens of millions of dollars of financing from USAID, taught
children,
to count with illustrations showing tanks,
missiles and land mines, and while USAID dropped funding for the
program in 1994, the books continued in circulation, even after the
Taliban came to power in 1996, and private humanitarian groups paid for
continued re-printings during the Taliban years. Today, the books remain
widely available in schools and shops.[133]
The entire program was coordinated with the CIA.[134]
The National Endowment for Democracy (NED)
is another particularly covert imperial force, a NGO that gets all its
funding from the US government, and about which U.S. Congressman Ron Paul
explained eloquently:
The misnamed National Endowment for
Democracy is nothing more than a costly program that takes US taxpayer
funds to promote favored politicians and political parties abroad. What
the NED does in foreign countries ... would be rightly illegal in the
United States. The NED injects soft money' into the domestic elections
of foreign countries in favor of one party or the other.
Imagine what a couple of hundred thousand dollars will do to assist a
politician or political party in a relatively poor country abroad. It is
particularly Orwellian to call US manipulation of foreign elections
promoting democracy.'
How would Americans feel if the Chinese
arrived with millions of dollars to support certain candidates deemed
friendly to China? Would this be viewed as a democratic development?[135]
The NED and a host of other NGOs (backed by
government funding), as well as private foundations, have implemented a
soft power approach to implementing democratic regime change in
countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, often aimed at replacing
former Western puppet leaders with new puppet leaders to better promote
imperial interests in the nations where they take place.
This has occurred in Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine,
Kyrgyzstan and many other countries.[136]
An effort was undertaken to impose a similar
democratic regime change with the CIA funneling $400 million for
implementing this soft power strategy in Iran, resulting in the Iranian
elections protests in the summer of 2009.
While the strategy failed in its aims of regime
change it mounted an incredibly successful international propaganda
campaign, so much so that the world was lashing out against Iran for what
the West claimed were fraudulent elections (but turned out to be free and
fair elections), and at the same time, the Western media failed to cover a
successful military coup in Honduras, in which the democratically elected
President was kidnapped and sent to a foreign country, while the subsequent
dictatorship brutally repressed peoples protests and demonstrations, with
the new regime all the while being supported by the United States.[137]
From this we can see that the Friends of Yemen promoting democratization
and good governance in Yemen serves Western imperial ambitions.
In the very least, it is designed to stifle and
ultimately lobotomize organic, indigenous liberation, self-determination,
and autonomy movements, while the same Western nations militarily arm and
support the oppressive government in its repression of these people. It
seems that for the time being, America has chosen to support the current
Yemeni dictatorship, propping it up to crush its own people and their
struggles for liberation.
Simultaneously, America and the West are
preparing themselves for a long-term strategy of democratization, in which
they may have to replace Saleh and the current regime with a new client
regime to secure American interests and hegemony in the region.
In this context we may view the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI),
a program of the U.S. State Department aimed at supporting reforms in the
Middle East and North Africa, in which they support international and local
NGOs, educational institutions, local governments and private businesses to
implement projects designed to directly engage and invest in the people of
the region.
MEPI has completed roughly 28 programs in Yemen
alone, with roughly seven grants ongoing, aimed at organizing journalists,
human rights activists, improving the Parliamentary process, improving
political participation, promoting womens empowerment, and raising
democratic awareness.[138]
The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is also active in Yemen,
funding and running programs aimed at promoting civic and human rights
awareness, facilitating,
the free flow of independent news
information to Yemenis on issues related to social, political, and
economic growth of the country and to build the capacity of journalists
to effectively monitor and report on human rights issues, as well as
identifying the political needs and concerns of women, and to push
political parties to adopt womens issues in their party platforms.
One program of the NED includes nearly $200,000
of funding for the Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE).
According to their website, CIPE,
strengthens democracy around the globe
through private enterprise and market-oriented reform. CIPE is one of
the four core institutes of the National Endowment for Democracy, and
is also an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.[139]
The $184,000 grant to CIPE from the NED is to,
facilitate access to information and
analysis about economic reform, which will include producing thirty
20-30 minute radio programs on economic reform in Yemen and sponsor
economic reform pages in two independent newspapers, in order to
empower Yemenis to participate in the democratic and economic reform
process.[140]
However, considering the group promotes private
enterprise and is affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
information and analysis about economic reform is more likely to be
misinformation and propaganda. In total, the NED is operating roughly 13
programs in Yemen at the moment.[141]
USAIDs programs in Yemen aim at taking the missionary position in
addressing some of the symptoms of conflict, deprivation,
disenfranchisement, and oppression, without allowing the people to seek
emancipation and liberation.
These programs includes a,
new three-year Responsive Governance
Project [which] aims to strengthen government institutions, support
reforms including decentralization, and improve the delivery of public
services while encouraging more citizen participation in the political
process, as well as the Community Livelihoods Project that is focusing
on improving agriculture and increasing employment opportunities in
highly vulnerable communities, especially for youth.
Other programs aim at promoting education,
health care, and peace and security.[142]
So, while the U.S. government uses the IMF to wreck the economy of Yemen,
spreading poverty and dismantling health care, social services and
education; the U.S. simultaneously funds and arms the Yemeni dictatorship to
repress the people rising up against their economic, social and political
conditions; yet, again simultaneously, the United States - through USAID and
various other democratization programs - aims to alleviate some of the
social repercussions to maintain stability of their interests.
Imperialism has an economic facet (the IMF), a
political facet (military-intelligence support), and a social facet (NGOs
and democratization).
Thus we also see the significance in that while the CIA expands its
operations in Yemen (in support of the dictatorship), the current CIA
Director holds doubts about,
whether Washington can count on Yemen in
the long-term to fight al Qaeda, citing internal unrest that threatens
to destabilize the government and break up the country, along with
growing anti-American sentiment.[143]
This is made all the more interesting to take
into account that the CIA Director announced that the CIA will be expanding
its use of under-cover assets through a variety of unofficial organizations
- such as corporations or other organizations.[144]
War, Empire, and
Perception Management - Propaganda Creates Cultural Schizophrenia
So who exactly is the US supporting in Yemen?
Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power
since 1978, first ruling North Yemen, and subsequently ruling all of Yemen.
Saleh has managed to remain the ruler of a united Yemen by,
clamping down on the press, concentrating
military and economic power in the hands of friends and family and
winning elections by suspiciously high margins.
Time Magazine reported that Saleh
described ruling Yemen as dancing on the heads of snakes. Saleh, however,
can hardly act as if he rules a united Yemen, when two-thirds of the
country is in the hands of either separatist groups or local tribes.
Further:
Yemen's most volatile regions are among
those hardest hit by drought and government neglect - are at the heart
of most of those conflicts, especially the war between the government
and Shi'ite rebels, known as Houthis, that is being waged in the
northern province of Sa'ada.[145]
The significance of this piece of information,
located in the Time article, which was otherwise propagandistic of the
fight against al-Qaeda, is that it acknowledges that the key to Yemens
issues today is the legitimacy of the central governments rule over the
people of Yemen.
The essential issue is that this is about
peoples rights to govern themselves, to not be oppressed, not be murdered,
nor economically devoured by international capital and national industrial
interests. Our nations and our media call these people terrorists; our
intelligence agencies sponsor terrorists in these nations, who kill these
people, and then we use that as an excuse to send in the military to kill
more of these people.
We support an illegitimate government, an
oppressive and brutal dictator who vowed to crack down with an iron fist
in August of 2009. His subsequent iron fist created a humanitarian
tragedy, where by September over 25,000 people had become refugees,[146]
by October 2009, over 55,000 people fled their homes due to the conflict.[147]
These are the people the West is helping the
Yemeni dictator kill. And not only him, but Saudi Arabia is helping, as are
Pakistan and Jordan, three other nations subservient to American interests,
and whose militaries are American made.
Saudi Arabia especially, as it seeks to prevent
the spread of the Shia resistance, which to the illegitimate state of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, combined with several other resistant and oppressed
groups, could create the political, economic and social conditions for
revolution.
No wonder then, that the United States is
planning to undertake the largest arms deal in American history with Saudi
Arabia, valued at $60 billion, which,
is aimed at establishing air superiority
over rival Iran while also addressing weaknesses bared in border
fighting with Yemeni rebels.[148]
A state seeks only its own survival and growth
in power; that is the nature of all states.
This is why nation-states are naturally inclined
to forgo competition for power with the economic sphere, and simply merge
interests and elite social structures. It is in their interest for both
survival and growth in power.
Our oppressive and illegitimate nation-states seek to aid in the oppression
of other peoples in other places, and increasingly so at home. However, it
is through the media that this massive collective wave of ignorance and
cultural schizophrenia takes place.
This is why most in the west see the world,
blissfully unaware of its realities. The media leads the people through that
old wardrobe into the land of Narnia: the medias perception management of
the world is nothing but a fantasy.
A good example of this fantasy world is
located in a Time Magazine article.
It wrote:
On Dec. 17 and 24, joint Yemeni-U.S. strikes
against purported AQAP [Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] training
camps took place and killed more than 60 militants, U.S. intelligence
officials claimed.[149]
The attack, in reality, killed 52 people, more
than half of them being women and children, in which a US missile armed with
cluster ammunition was used, with both the Yemeni and American governments
claiming the target was an al-Qaeda training camp.
The cruise missile was designed to be fired from
a warship or submarine, and was filled with,
cluster munitions which spray steel
fragments for 150 meters along with burning zirconium for igniting
buildings. However, the Yemeni government does not possess cruise
missiles, which are part of the arsenal of US Navy vessels patrolling
off the Horn of Africa and in the Arabian Sea.[150]
The missiles were launched on direct
presidential orders.[151]
Our governments kill these people and call them militants and
terrorists, our media repeat the accusation with no dissent. War is like
no other situation that can lead to the growth of the state. War is the
ultimate organizing principle in society, for with war powers, a nation can
build, destroy, grow, oppress, control, expand, consume, corrupt and
continue.
As this power grows, so too does the power of
all the other various major spheres of influence over humanity, such as the
media and the academics. We can add to that the scientific and technological
elite, who help to create the conditions, understanding, technology, and
means of expanding power and controlling the masses so that today we have
unmanned aerial vehicles called Predator Drones flying over Yemen killing
innocent civilians, while the drones are operated from American military
bases in Florida.
America has been doing the exact same thing in
Pakistan at a much more significant rate and for a much longer period of
time (and most rapidly accelerated under the
Obama
administration of change).
This invisible empire is managed through perception management -
propaganda - which infects all spheres of social power structures, but which
is arguably most prominent and powerful in the media.
This creates among western citizens, and most
particularly among Americans, a type of cultural schizophrenia in which
the mind of the nation (how the majority of people view their nation and
their world) is so contrary to the reality of that nation and the world
around it, that it creates a nation or a people of two minds, holding both
the fantasy world of those who encompass it, and the hard-bitten reality of
global power structures and systems.
This cultural schizophrenia is most emblematic in the United States, where
the majority of those within it view it as a force for good in the world,
spreading freedom, democracy and free markets around the world; while the
reality is so different, that the majority of the rest of the world view the
United States as a force for spreading fear, war, economic exploitation and
power.
This is the view, especially, of those to whom
the United States has attempted to spread freedom and democracy.
This has slightly changed in the context of the war on terror, which has
allowed for flowery rhetoric about democratic rights and liberty to subside
beside the urgency of fighting terror.
Around the world, people were rejecting the
liberal democratic project in replacing the dictatorships of the 70s - 90s
with [neo]liberal democratic governments, which were democratic only so much
as they created political powers and held usually corrupt elections in which
various power factions would compete for the authority to plunder the nation
in cooperation with international corporations, financial institutions and
western governments.
Democracy in the Third World had essentially
proven itself a farce, and peoples movements were increasing.
The war
on terror has subsequently fiercely mobilized the American
military (and its NATO cohorts), vastly increased its scope, operations,
abilities and entanglements; and created the political conditions for the
nation to rapidly accelerate the use of its military apparatus around the
world, something which the American people would not support without what is
perceived to be a good reason.
After all, they will largely be the ones forced
to fight and partake in these wars. And so we come back to Yemen.
As Martin Luther King said in 1967,
We are on the wrong side of a world
revolution.
