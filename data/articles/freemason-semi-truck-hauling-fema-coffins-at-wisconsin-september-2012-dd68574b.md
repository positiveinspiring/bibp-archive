Are these more of
the so-called FEMA coffins being hauled in Wisconsin
aboard this Freemason semi-truck in the video below?
The
Freemason symbol (below images) is clearly visible on the
front of the truck:
These boxes do not look exactly like the coffins
exposed by Jesse Ventura in Conspiracy Theory and shown in the
picture above, but look similar.
-
Are they some other type of underground vault?
The structures clearly say grade line.
-
Could they be underground
electrical vaults?
-
What do you think?
-
Are these the dreaded FEMA coffins?
My personal opinion is I think that they are some other type of underground
vault.
Caution! Very loud noise do to wind...
