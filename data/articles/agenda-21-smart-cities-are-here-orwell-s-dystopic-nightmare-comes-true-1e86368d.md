Our brave new world starts with these
brave new cities
So-called smart cities arent just some far off
futuristic abstract twinkle in the
New World Orders eye
these are being
built right now.
Think privacy and freedom are limited
commodities now? Try having either of those things living in a smart city
control grid where everything you do is tracked, traced, chipped and
monitored 24 hours a day.
Masdar
City - City of the Future
Currently being built in Abu Dhabi at a price
tag of $22 billion,
Masdar (which means "the source") is a six-kilometer
walled smart city shaped like two squares that resemble The Borgs Unicomplex from the sci-fi TV show Star Trek.
Set for a target population of 50,000 people,
the city promises to be carbon emission-free with 100% renewable energy.
Traditional cars are completely out; while
walking, biking and mass transit are encouraged. Futuristic driverless
personal rapid transit (PRT) pod cars are being considered, but are
apparently quite costly.
The tiny cars look like a smaller version of the
little electronic cars featured in the 1980s film Total Recall.
As a research and testing ground for smart
technologies,
The National reported,
"The
officials running Masdars power grid will have
access to detailed data on how energy
is being used at any given moment and will have the means to directly
moderate high rates of consumption to balance supply with
demand."
Sensometrix SA - a Geneva-based
company and leader in next generation biometric technology with products
including "SensoBrain" and the eerie biometric slogan "Your hand is the
future" -
will work
with Masdar to continue developing the companys security technologies
such as identity access management.
The International Renewable Energy Agency
(IRENA) headquarters is set to reside in Masdar as well.
After the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
signed on to the project in 2010,
Hillary Clinton spoke at The Masdar Institute, remarking,
"the
partnership that we have established between the United States and Abu
Dhabi around renewable energy and climate change and sustainable
development that takes advantage of human capital is one of the most
important partnerships for the future that we could be pursuing."
Clinton also noted the work in Masdar is "in the
interest of global progress".
While truly sustainable, renewable green energy
sources are a positive thing on the surface, the flip side to this community
is that everything will be wired into a top-to-bottom, completely controlled
smart grid.
As experimental technologies are tested out over
there, the U.S. deal through the DOE ensures these technologies will be
"shared" (or someday imposed?) over here.
Considering the rise of these smart
cities, NY Times
Nicolai Ouroussoff
wrote,
"What
Masdar really represents, in fact, is the crystallization of another
global phenomenon: the growing division of the world into refined,
high-end enclaves and vast formless ghettos where issues like
sustainability have little immediate relevance."
The city was set for 2016 completion, but
several delays, including dust storms that incapacitated the solar panels,
have set Masdar back to a potential 2020 end date.
Songdo
International Business District: A City in a Box
The 100 million square foot
Songdo, a $40
billion project by Gale International and Morgan Stanley Real Estate, has
been dubbed the "City in a Box," and is set for completion by 2015.
Smart Data Collective.com reports that Songdo will be completely wired,
with microchips and/or wireless sensors in practically everything from
houses to cars to children who will wear tracking bracelets
just in case they get lost.
TelePresence screens will adorn all businesses
and shops. Even the garbage will offer the citys central monitoring unit
real-time data for instant analysis via microchip cards.
As if the ubiquitous sensors and microchips
werent enough, everything in Songdo will also be
monitored via CCTV cameras as well.
"The
data will provide valuable insights in how people work, live and
think within the smart city," wrote
Mark van Rijmenam of Smart Data Collective.
Smart Grid, Stupid Implications
At first, giving real-time data on everything
you do from the utilities you use to the garbage you throw away to a giant
computer to help regulate resources and waste might sound helpful.
Leave your water running? No worries, a computer
can send a signal to the main control hub to shut it off for you.
But as David Sasaki points out, smart
cities could lead to dumb citizens:
"There
is a real risk that as our lives become more automated we become more
like automatons. We will follow the guidance of our smart
phones without reflecting on how we live our lives, and how we engage in
our communities."
Sasakis comment recalls the instance of
Japanese tourists driving their car into an Australian bay because they
followed orders from their GPS over their own eyeballs.
Beyond that, while Sasaki notes that citizens
could be given tax breaks, for example, if they reduce their water
consumption, the same hand that can give can also take away by penalizing
those in smart cities who use what might be considered too much of any
resource - a determination that could easily adjust over time to become even
more restrictive.
Ever since 9/11 in America, weve seen a
government that,
-
has completely abandoned the
Constitution with undeclared drone wars that lack any form of due
process
-
the declaration of the homeland as a
battlefield and the ability to detain and disappear citizens with
the National Defense Authorization Act
-
unprecedented expansion of the National
Security Administration big brother surveillance state
-
the continual militarization of our
police and further expansion of the Transportation Security
Administration
-
unfair targeting practices of certain
political groups considered oppositional to the presidents agenda
by the Internal Revenue Service just to name a few
Smart grid cities have the potential to bring
some really wonderful alternative energy sources to the table, but with the
power balance shifted into all the wrong hands, these cities amount to
little more than glorified electronic concentration camps with trendy
fa√ßades that play on "green guilt".
To put tyrannical governments in control of a
network of these electronic concentration camps makes George Orwells
dystopian novel
1984 look like a Sunday afternoon at a preschool playground.
