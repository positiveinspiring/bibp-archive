A new video has just been released in which Pope Francis very clearly expresses his belief that all of the major religions are different paths to the same 'God'.
He says that while people from various global faiths may be,
"seeking 'God' or meeting 'God' in different ways" that it is important to keep in mind that "we are all children of 'God'."
This is the most recent example that shows that the Pope has completely abandoned any notion that a relationship with 'God' is available only through Jesus Christ.
As he has done throughout his papacy, he continues to lay the groundwork for the coming one world religion, and yet hardly anyone seems upset by this. When I first heard of this new video, I was so stunned that I thought that it might be a joke.
But the truth is that this video is very real.
The following comes from an article that was put out by Catholic News Agency
The Pope's first-ever video message on his monthly prayer intentions was released Tuesday, highlighting the importance of interreligious dialogue and the beliefs different faith traditions hold in common, such as the figure of 'God' and love. "Many think differently, feel differently, seeking 'God' or meeting 'God' in different ways. In this crowd, in this range of religions, there is only one certainty that we have for all: we are all children of 'God'," Pope Francis said in his message, released Jan. 6, the feast of the Epiphany.

But it isn't just Pope Francis speaking in this video.
In fact, one section of the video features leaders from various global religions expressing faith in their respective deities.

The video then features clips of those from different world religions declaring belief in their various deities. "I have confidence in Buddha," a female lama announces. "I believe in 'God'," a rabbi affirms. "I believe in Jesus Christ," a priest states. "I believe in Allah," an Islamic leader declares.

Are you shocked yet?
The Pope closes the video with an appeal for people from every religion to talk with one another and to work with one another.
Here is more from Catholic News Agency
Later on, after the Pope affirms that all, regardless of their religious profession, are children of 'God', the faith leaders state their common belief in love. Pope Francis closes the video by expressing his hope that viewers, "will spread my prayer request this month: that sincere dialogue among men and women of different faiths may produce fruits of peace and justice. I have confidence in your prayers."

If you have not seen this video yet, it is definitely worth a few minutes of your time.

Of course this is not the first time that Pope Francis has done something like this.
Very early in his papacy, he authorized "Islamic prayers and readings from the Quran" at the Vatican for the first time ever.
And as I documented in a previous article entitled "In New York, Pope Francis Embraced Chrislam and Laid a Foundation for A One World Religion", during his visit to St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan he made it very clear that he believes that Christians and Muslims worship the same 'God'.
The following is how he began his address
I would like to express two sentiments for my Muslim brothers and sisters. Firstly, my greetings as they celebrate the feast of sacrifice. I would have wished my greeting to be warmer. My sentiments of closeness, my sentiments of closeness in the face of tragedy. The tragedy that they suffered in Mecca. In this moment, I give assurances of my prayers. I unite myself with you all. A prayer to almighty god, all merciful.

In Islam, one of Allah's primary titles is "the all-merciful one".
If you doubt this, just do a Google search. And this certainly was not the first time that Pope Francis has used such language.
For example, check out the following excerpt from remarks that he made during his very first ecumenical meeting as Pope
I then greet and cordially thank you all, dear friends belonging to other religious traditions; first of all the Muslims, who worship the one 'God', living and merciful, and call upon Him in prayer, and all of you. I really appreciate your presence: in it I see a tangible sign of the will to grow in mutual esteem and cooperation for the common good of humanity. The Catholic Church is aware of the importance of promoting friendship and respect between men and women of different religious traditions - I wish to repeat this: promoting friendship and respect between men and women of different religious traditions - it also attests the valuable work that the Pontifical Council for interreligious dialogue performs.

Are you starting to get the picture?
Pope Francis believes that all religions are different paths to the same 'God', and he is working hard to lay a foundation for the coming one world religion.
After watching this most recent video, I don't know how anyone can possibly deny that.
However, there are some religious people that Pope Francis does not like. Just recently, he referred to Christian fundamentalism as "a sickness", and he made it clear that there was no room for it in Catholicism.
So precisely what is "fundamentalism"?
Google defines it as,
"a form of a religion, especially Islam or Protestant Christianity, that upholds belief in the strict, literal interpretation of scripture."
Does this mean that Pope Francis is against any Christian that believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible?
That does appear to be what he is saying, and without a doubt those would be the Christians that would be against the kind of one world religion that he appears to be promoting.
Nearly 2000 years ago, the Apostle John warned us that a one world religion was coming, and now we can see that it is coming to fruition.
