Joint Chiefs of Staff
If the United States needed to defend itself, then this would be a viable
group of people to employ but the United States of America is the aggressor.
Here are the facts. In 1899 after the United States successfully defeated
Spain in the Spanish American War, U.S. military invaded the Philippines
and performed the same atrocities that it would do sixty nine years later
in Vietnam in My Lai village.
According to Stanley Karnow's Vietnam: A History The First Complete Account
of Vietnam at War ©1983 The Viking Press, "The Philippines, the
major possession to remain under American tutelage, were finally subdued
after a protracted 'pacification' campaign which foreshadowed U.S. strategy
in Vietnam."
Let's examine what pacification means. Webster's Third International
Dictionary defines the term as "the act or process of achieving or restoring
peace: elimination of disturbance: TRANQUILIZATION SUBDUAL<from the tumult
of Hell, through the gradual pacification of Purgatory, to the perfect peace
of Paradise-G.G. Coulton> <seven million Arabs and Berbers, whose pacification
had been completed only eight years before-C.R. Codman> What does this
really mean, however?
In his brilliant book The Perfect War, Professor James William
"Bill" Gibson (Ph.D. Yale University) published the following, "Refugee camps
were not exciting in the sense of a new and wonderful life. One American
soldier described the camp where former residents of Ben Suc were sent after
the town was destroyed by the pacification program:
I saw that resettlement camp, and it looked to me very similar to
a Nazi concentration camp. Double barbed wire fences, machine gun towers.
You could not get in or get out. These people were existing only, they were
given just enough rice to keep alive, they were given Army blankets that
the American Army was getting ready to destroy because they were worn out;
they were living in tents that were damaged, almost useless, and there were
American Military Police guarding this concentration camp initially, and
then the South Veitnamese Army took over. And they started shooting without
warning anybody that was within a certain area of the fence." (page 232)
Moreover, other nations must defend from U.S. agression or threat of agression
so they purchase defense equipment in case they are attacked leading to a
circuitous effect in which nations feel that they must defend themselves
against the agression of the United States. The U.S. government continually
deceives the American people as to the reality of all these actions such
that the American people feel that the U.S. must defend itself.
After the Cold War ended, people thought now we can diminish the funding
which goes for defense but it never happens. It is never diminished. It's
time to end this folly so that the United States is just defending as it
was established in the U.S. Constitution instead of being the
aggressor. It is top secret information that every war since World War II
ended has been instigated by the United States of America even the wars in
which Americans military didn't participate. They have all been waged because
the American people, a peace loving people, have been deceived.
Ed's Note: The sixth edition of True Democracy will be
devoted to the veterans, all the veterans.
