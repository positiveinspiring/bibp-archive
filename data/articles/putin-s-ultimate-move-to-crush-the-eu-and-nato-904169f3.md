As fighting in Ukraine continues to intensify, today former U.S. Treasury official, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, spoke with King World News about Putin's ultimate move to crush the EU and NATO.
He also warned that the West may be handing the keys to victory to China and Russia.
Dr. Roberts: "Eric, right now there are a great many things in the financial system that can blow up but the real blow up is going to require flight from the dollar and the euro. Once that happens, they can't bail out the banks, the derivatives or the sovereign bonds. In the short-term, while they can still print money, they can keep this rigged system standing. But the minute the value of both the dollar and the euro start collapsing, that's when the game is over. Both of these currencies have increased in quantity far beyond the ability of the underlying economies to provide goods and services. When the flight comes there will be no way to stave off the instabilities that currently exist in the system... "There is the potential for a massive black swan to develop because of the Greek crisis and the election of the new government. This will unfold if the German banks, the creditors of Greece and the EU politicians refuse to accommodate the legitimate needs of the Greek government. The Greeks must renegotiate the harsh conditions that have been put on their country in order to solve their sovereign debt problem. The current agreement as it exists is intolerable to the Greeks and it can't stand. But if the Germans and the other Greek creditors don't agree, you could see an alliance between the Greeks and the Russians. BRICS $100 Billion Bank The BRICS now have this IMF-type bank and they have funded it with $100 billion. Putin now sees that he has the opportunity to break the Greeks off from the EU and from NATO. The BRICS bank would step in and help the Greeks with their debt-servicing problems. That could be the beginning of the unraveling of the European Union and NATO. You have to remember, Eric, that Italy, Spain and Portugal will be watching this situation with Greece very carefully. These countries still face the same kind of threats that are being applied to Greece. And of course the Irish have suffered dramatically under the austerity imposed on them. So if these countries see that Europe will not ameliorate the hardships that have been imposed on them by these austerity programs, and these countries turn to Russia, China and India - the BRICS - you would then see a total breakdown in the EU system. This is a system where the banks get countries in debt and then they send in the IMF to impose austerity. The Ultimate Black Swan As Countries Are Looted The bank's clients then buy the premier assets of these countries for pennies on the dollar. It's a looting process. That's what happened to Greece. It also happened to Ireland. So if these European countries realize that all they are just being looted, they will then accept Putin's offer and turn to the Russians and the Chinese. The BRICS can easily assist the Greeks. These countries would then abandon Germany, Washington and the IMF, who are imposing all these hardships on them and also looting their countries. So there is the potential for the ultimate disaster here if the West is stupid and arrogant enough not to bend. That would mean the unraveling of the European Union and of NATO - the ultimate black swan." Putin's Aggressive Move Into Europe Eric King: "Dr. Roberts, what we are seeing unfold right now has ramifications far beyond Greece. You are talking about an aggressive chess move by Putin and a massive sweep by the Russians and the Chinese into Europe - through the back door of Greece, and then eventually into Spain, Italy, Portugal, and possibly even Ireland. You are talking here about the total destruction of the EU and the Euro." Dr. Roberts: "That's exactly right. You see, Eric, the EU is telling the Greeks they won't change any conditions and if the Greeks don't agree they may simply expel the Greek government out of the EU and the euro system. Well, if they are that stupid, then Russia and China will enter - that's the opening. If that unfolds, then yes, the Chinese and the Russians can unwind NATO."

European Empire Now in...
Danger of Crumbling
by Paul Craig Roberts
Former U.S. Treasury Official January 30, 2015
As the Greeks are now moving to a take a stronger position against the EU, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts believes that the European empire is now in danger of crumbling. He also warned that the West may be in grave danger if the situation in Greece spins out of control.

Having just written that Greece needs Spartans in order to prevail over its creditors and the EU, the new Greek government is showing signs of being Spartans.
Listen to these words from Greece's new Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras:
"We should not accept or recognize the government of neo-Nazis in Ukraine." "The EU lacks democracy, and citizens do not believe that their vote can change policy."
"We should not accept or recognize the government of neo-Nazis in Ukraine."
"The EU lacks democracy, and citizens do not believe that their vote can change policy."
Rebellious Spartans Pitting Greece Against The EU? The new Greek government has protested the latest EU denunciation of Russia, saying that the attack on Russia was reported in the media as if the decision was unanimous, whereas in fact,
Greece Slovakia Hungary Austria,
Greece
Slovakia
Hungary
Austria,
...objected.
No new sanctions on Russia have been imposed. The New Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said that a provision that would have imposed further sanctions on Russia was removed at Greece's insistence from the proposals at the meeting.
Greece also required that the communiqué does not directly blame Russia for the conflict in Ukraine. German foreign minister Steinmeier apparently blustered that the EU would lambast Russia with more words if the independent-minded eastern Ukrainians launched an offensive against the defeated forces that took part in Kiev's latest assault on the Russian provinces of Ukraine.
Washington's puppet state in Ukraine is vulnerable to collapse if Russia permitted the independent-minded provinces a free hand.
Austerity To Produce Revolutions In Europe One cannot avoid wondering how long EU officials, Merkel, and Cameron can defend the imposition of austerity upon the peoples of Europe before they are hung off of lamp posts.
The kind of austerity that is demanded of Greece and other European peoples is the kind that produces revolutions. The kind of ignorant arrogance that characterizes Washington's neoconservatives now afflicts the EU leadership.
"Let them eat cake" is the cry and the policy.
If the new Greek government adheres to its Red Cloaks and the EU looters do not bend, Greece can turn to the new BRICS bank for its financing and turn its back to the EU.
The other southern European countries that are set up for looting could follow. Intransigence on the part of the EU and Greece's creditors could unleash a Black Swan that could unwind the EU and, consequently, NATO.
Peace would descend upon the plundered and war-torn earth.
If the greed and stupidity of Greece's creditors and the inflexibility of Germany and the EU persist, Washington's European Empire could crumble. Just like Xerxes' army. The Immortals proved to be no more immortal than the Exceptional people have proven to be exceptional. A few Red Cloaks can scatter the lot. Let's hope Greece gets on with the job.
