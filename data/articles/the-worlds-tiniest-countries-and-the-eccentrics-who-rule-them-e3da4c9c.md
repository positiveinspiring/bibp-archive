Never heard of,
You're not alone.
Léo
Delafontaine hadn't either until 2012, when he
visited the
Republic of Saugeais, a self-proclaimed micronation in
eastern France. He's since become fascinated with "countries"
unrecognized by world governments and organizations.
His book Micronations
documents independent states that are just as varied and interesting
as their official counterparts.
"Humankind likes discoveries and
challenges. One solution is the creation of new countries, but
not in order to persecute people or for religious reasons.
The idea, rather, is to create new
countries and territories for fun, to make people think, to
re-enchant the world in a way," he says via email.
French writer and historian Bruno
Fuligni, who wrote the introduction to Micronations,
estimates there are more than 400 of these self-proclaimed entities.
Delfontaine visited 12
locations throughout the US, Europe, and Australia.
They included monarchies, republics,
"funny dictatorships," and some with no government at all. He earned
citizenship in three - the Principality of Sealand, the Principality
of Seborga, and the Conch Republic.
The Principality
of Hutt River in Australia draws thousands of visitors
annually, which is one reason it exists at all. Others serve as
political satire.
The Conch Republic, for example, was created
in 1982 after Key West Mayor Dennis Wardlow,
"symbolically began the Conch
Republic's Civil Rebellion by breaking a loaf of stale Cuban
bread over the head of a man dressed in a U.S. Navy uniform"
according to the Conch Republic's
Website.

Anderson,
Secretary General of
the Conch Republic
Some micronations are easily
accessible while others are difficult to get to.
In Copenhagen, tourists can enter
Freetown Christiania on foot, while visitors to the Principality of Sealand, a WWII island fortress six miles off the
eastern shores of Britain, have to shell out over $2,000 for
transport and a visa.
With a living area of
5,920 square feet,
Sealand boasts
multiple bedrooms, a chapel and a prison.
Regardless of their intention, these
countries commit:
They have national anthems and
flags, passports and coins, militaries and laws.
The
Kingdom of Elleore hosts history
classes for kids and created its own national sport.
"Most of the people I met were
really well educated, curious, ironic and completely aware of
what they are doing. They are not crazy or greedy for power. But
they like to dress up and make fun of their country of origin,"
he says.

the Kingdom of Elleore.
Most of these micronations
declared "sovereignty" between the 1970s and 1990s.
But there have been some
newcomers:
the Imperial
Kingdom of Calsahara in southern California
declared its sovereignty in 2009.
Delafontaine says most new
micronations, like the Kingdom
of Talossa, exist primarily online.
"I think that the golden age of
micronations is almost over. The famous ones, like the
Principality of Hutt River and the Republic of Saugeais, are
headed by very old people," he says.
"And after their death, their
micronations will disappear with them. Young people interested
in micronations don't seem to be interested in claiming a
physical territory. They prefer to create new countries online.
It's not better or worse, but it's different."
