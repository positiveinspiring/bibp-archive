Trade:
Mexico is going to be the
most important neighbor in U.S. history.
With this pact, its path on the road to
democracy and openness will be assured.

NEW YORK
Before the end of summer, President
Bill
Clinton will ask Congress to approve the
North American Free Trade
Agreement, linking the United States with Canada and Mexico in a free-trade
area comprising a population of 370 million and a gross national product of
$6 trillion.
It will represent the most creative step toward
a new world order taken by any group of countries since the end of the Cold
War, and the first step toward the even larger vision of a free-trade zone
for the entire Western Hemisphere.
And yet, recent polls show that barely half the American people have even
heard of it.
This offers the President a real chance for leadership in educating the
public to the opportunity before them. Since the end of the Cold War. fear
of communism can no longer serve as the cement of international order. With
the collapse of the ideological challenge, traditional pat terns of
nationalism have gained ground nearly everywhere.
The post-Cold War world has witnessed growing
rivalries reminiscent of the tensions preceding World War I.
In this light, developments in the Western Hemisphere are crucial to global
order. Here, a group of democratic nations has pledged itself to the
Enterprise for the Americas initiative based on popular governments and
market economies.
The sole dictatorship remaining in the Western
Hemisphere is Cuba; state-run enterprises are being privatized;
nationalistic, protectionist methods of economic management are replaced by
export-oriented economies hospitable to foreign investment and supportive of
open trading systems.
The revolution sweeping the Western Hemisphere
points to an international order based on cooperation.
It is this revolution that is at stake in the ratification of
NAFTA. What
Congress will have before it is not a conventional trade agreement but the
architecture of a new international system. Strong presidential leadership in the
ratification battle is urgently required.
As the only nationally elected
U.S. leader, Clinton is in the best position to put NAFTA into a broad
strategic framework and explain why it serves the national interest. He must
not permit the treatys opponents to define NAFTA as a problem of economic
arithmetic.
In this task, the President is entitled to bipartisan support. NAFTAs key
provisions were concluded during
the
Bush Administration; its supplementary
agreements are being negotiated in the Clinton Administration. But NAFTA is
so vital to prospects for global progress that it merits a demonstration of
nonpartisan unity.
America has never had a neighbor of the importance Mexico will acquire in
the next century - with or without NAFTA.
By then it will be a country
with a population of more than 100 million and equal to the Asian little
tigers such as Korea. Our de facto open borders make friendly relations a
vital national interest. Twenty-million Mexican residents in the United
States link the interests of the two nations on the human level.
The healthier Mexicos economy, the lower the
illegal immigration and the greater U.S. exports will be to an economy whose
propensity to import from us is the highest in the world.
Even on strictly economic grounds, NAFTA is to
our long-range advantage.
When all the major Latin American countries
have raised their sights to a new partnership
based on values the U.S. has espoused for
decades,
a retreat from it by America would be a
shattering blow.
Most studies suggest the nation would gain more jobs than it would lose -
though the problem is that those who lose jobs are not usually the ones who
benefit from gains in employment.
Nonetheless, let us not delude ourselves: The movement of U.S. industry to
Mexico, cited by many NAFTA critics, has occurred despite current tariff
barriers, which are already low. What the critics are seeking is not just a
defeat of NAFTA, but an increase in tariffs against Mexico. Such a policy
would put an end to any hope of a new Western Hemisphere relationship and
encourage the rise of nationalism.
For Mexico has been in the vanguard of the revolution sweeping the Western
Hemisphere. Not so long ago, its foreign policy was defined by anti-US
rhetoric and its economic policy by statist leftwing attitudes.
Import substitution, the euphemism for
protectionism, was the dominant trend and anti-gringo suspicion a key
feature of the internal Mexican debate.
Starting with the presidency of Miguel de la Madrid in 1982, Mexico
began to reverse these patterns. Under President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, the process assumed tidal proportions. Salinas opened Mexico to
foreign investment, lowered tariffs, insisted on free competition, quelled
corruption and brought into office many young, highly trained technocrats.
In the interval between Salinas election and
his oath of office, I asked the newly elected president whether he could
ever visualize a free-trade system in the Western Hemisphere. He replied
that, given Mexican political history, this was a distant dream; the best he
could accomplish would be sector-by-sector negotiation which, after a
substantial interval, might be tied together into a comprehensive
understanding.
A year later, Salinas apparently decided that
the cost of halfway measures was not far lower than the price of doing the
right thing and opted to go all-out for what is now called NAFTA.
Salinas has overcome considerable domestic Mexican reservations. He has gone
to great lengths lo respond to U.S. concerns - even negotiating side
agreements on the environment and labor that his left-wing opponents
describe as interference in Mexicos domestic legislation.
Nonetheless, the ancient themes of Mexican
political discourse are still just below the surface. They remain the staple
of Salinas left-wing opposition.
NAFTAs defeat in Congress would be a stinging
rebuff to the most market-oriented, democratic administration Mexico has
ever had and would humiliate Salinas - a particular problem as Mexico gears
up for next years presidential election.
It would be a disaster if U.S. actions
encouraged the re-emergence of nationalistic candidates and reversed the
trend toward cooperation between two neighbors. History will surely record
the Enterprise Initiative for the Americas as one of the most important U.S.
initiatives since
the Marshall Plan.
The trade agreement with Mexico is the vital
first step for a new kind of community of nations, built on a common base of
democratic values, drawn together by the free exchange of goods, services
and capital, dedicated to human rights and committed to the preservation of
their common environment.
It is a creative response to the coincidental
decision by the major nations of Latin America during the past decade to
move decisively down the road of economic opening and political reform; it
looks far beyond the Organization of American States and its outmoded focus
on national security.
At a moment when all the major Latin American countries have raised their
sights to a new partnership based on values the United States has espoused
for decades, a retreat from it by America would be a shattering blow to this
vision for a new and better world.
A regional Western Hemisphere organization dedicated to democracy and free
trade would be a first step toward the new world order so frequently cited
but so rarely implemented. It would permit the countries to respond to any
of the various ways in which the international order may evolve. Almost
every country pays lip service to a global free-trading system.
It would be shortsighted, however, to ignore the
regional groupings emerging in both Europe and Asia as possible
alternatives.
A Western Hemisphere-wide free-trade system - with NAFTA as the first step -
would give the Americas a commanding role no matter what happens. If
principles of
the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade prevail, it will become a major participant in global economic growth;
if regional groupings dominate, the Western Hemisphere with its vast market
will more than hold its own.
Clinton has preferred not to deflect Congress from focusing on his economic
package. But the stakes are too high to wait.
He must take the lead in defining the issues -
though he should not do this alone. Instead, he should enlist former
presidents, secretaries of state and other leaders in one of the broad-based
coalitions by which previous new departures in foreign policy - like the
Marshall Plan - were put before the public.
If that happens, Clintons will be perceived as
a seminal presidency whatever else transpires while he is in office.

I can track the plans for a "Canadian Community" and a "Canadian Union" as
stage one of a "North American Community" and "North American Union" back to
the 1960s in Quebec, shortly after the European Economic Community was
started.
Everywhere, Big Business overlaps with the Rhodes Secret Society for world
government,
which is the RIIA-CFR-CIIA, and Communists.
I can prove in court that the referendums in Quebec to "secede" were really
referendums
to get the North American Union started.
I would argue that 9/11 was done because the 1995 Quebec referendum failed,
the CFR's bid to the 1996 Subcommittee for a "supranational affiliation"
apparently failed, and something had to be done to advance Kissinger's NAFTA
in the meantime: SPP was a direct response to 9/11,
which was done for North
American Union,
not just for the Iraq war.
A third - and final - referendum in Quebec by about late 2014-15 will be
used to trigger the political dismantling of Canada and the U.S.A., now that
vertical integration of the continent has largely been done under the SPP.
Beware of "secession" movements in America: the CFR needs one to complete
the dismantling of North America that will start in Quebec.
The Quebec-Canada gang are all working with the CIIA - now called "Open
Canada":
it's the Canadian branch of the CFR.
"Secession" is illegal in Canada. The Constitution was designed that way in
1867 to prevent Canada's being annexed to the U.S.A. Annexation is
unconstitutional for Canada. I am going to stop the North American Union
right here.
Help me out, it's expensive to file in court!
