As the drums of war begin to beat once again in,
...and other potential hotspots and flashpoints around the globe,
concerned citizens are asking how a world so sick of bloodshed and a
population so tired of conflict could be led to this spot once again.
To understand this seeming paradox, we must first understand the
centuries-long history of how media has been used to whip the nation into
wartime frenzy, dehumanize the supposed enemies, and even to manipulate the
public into believing in causes for war that, decades later, were admitted
to be completely fictitious.
The term yellow journalism was coined to describe the type of
sensationalistic, scandal-driven, and often erroneous style of reporting
popularized by newspapers like William Randolph Hearsts New York Journal.
In one of the most egregious examples of this phenomenon, Hearsts papers
widely trumpeted the sinking of the Maine as the work of the Spanish:
Whipped into an anti-Spanish frenzy by a daily torrent of stories depicting
Spanish forces alleged torture and rape of Cubans, and pushed over the edge
by the Maine incident, the public welcomed the beginning of the US-Spanish
war.
Although it is now widely believed that the explosion on the Maine was
due to a fire in one of its coal bunkers, the initial lurid reports of
Spanish involvement stuck and the nation was led into war.
In many ways, the phrase infamously attributed to Hearst in reply to his
illustrator,
You furnish the pictures and Ill furnish the war,
...apocryphal
as the story may be, nevertheless perfectly encodes the method by which the
public would be led to war time and again through the decades.
The US was drawn into World War I by the sinking of the Lusitania, a British
ocean liner carrying American passengers that was torpedoed by German
U-boats off the coast of Ireland, killing over 1,000 of its passengers.
What
the public was not informed about at the time, of course, was that just one
week before the incident, then-First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill
had written to the President of the Board of Trade that it was,
most
important to attract neutral shipping to our shores, in the hopes especially
of embroiling the United States with Germany.
Nor did reports of the attack
announce that the ship
was carrying rifle ammunition and other military
supplies. Instead, reports once again emphasized that the attack was an
out-of-the-blue strike by a maniacal enemy, and the public was led into the
war.
The US involvement in World War II was likewise the result of deliberate
disinformation:
Although the Honolulu Advertiser had even predicted the
attack on Pearl Harbor (above image) days in advance, the Japanese Naval codes had
already
been deciphered by that time, and that even Henry Stimson, the US Secretary
of War, had
noted in his diary the week before that he had discussed in a
meeting with Roosevelt,
how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the
position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to
ourselves,
...the public were still led to believe that the Pearl Harbor
attack had been completely unforeseen.
Just last month, a
newly-declassified
memo emerged showing that FDR had been warned of an impending Japanese
attack on Hawaii just three days before the events at Pearl Harbor, yet the
history books still portray Pearl Harbor as an example of a surprise attack.
In August 1964, the public was told that the North Vietnamese had attacked a
US Destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin on two separate occasions. The attacks
were portrayed as a clear example of communist aggression and
a resolution
was soon passed in Congress authorizing President Johnson to begin deploying
US forces in Vietnam.
In 2005, an
internal NSA study was released concluding
that the second attack in fact never took place.
In effect, 60000 American
servicemen and as many as three million Vietnamese, let alone as many as
500,000 Cambodians and Laotians, lost their lives because of an incident
that did not occur anywhere but in the imagination of the
Johnson
administration and the pages of
the American media.
In 1991, the world was introduced to the emotional story of Nayirah (below
video), a
Kuwaiti girl who testified about the atrocities committed by Iraqi forces in
Kuwait.
FAKED 15-YO KUWAITI GIRL TESTIMONY BEFORE CONGRESS, 1990
What the world was never told was that the incident had in fact been the
work of a public relations firm, Hill and Knowltown, and the girl had
actually been the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador.
Once again, the public
was whipped into a frenzy of hatred for the Hussein regime, not for the
documented atrocities that it had actually committed on segments of its own
population with weapons supplied to them by the United States itself, but on
the basis of an imaginary story told to the public via their televisions,
orchestrated by a pr firm.
In the lead-up to the war on Iraq, the American media infamously took the
lead in framing the debate about the Iraqi governments weapons of mass
destruction NOT as a question of whether or not they even existed, but as a
question of where they had been hidden and what should be done to disarm
them.
The New York Times led the way with
Judith Millers
now infamous
reporting on the Iraqi WMD story, now known to have been based on false
information from untrustworthy sources, but the rest of the media
fell into
line with the NBC Nightly News asking,
what precise threat Iraq and its
weapons of mass destruction pose to America, and Time debating whether
Hussein was, making a good-faith effort to disarm Iraqs weapons of mass
destruction.
Reports about chemical weapons stashes were reported on before
they were confirmed, although headlines boldly asserted their existence as
indisputable fact.
We now know that in fact the stockpiles did not exist,
and the administration premeditatedly lied the country into yet another war,
but the most intense opposition the Bush administration ever received over
this documented war crime was some polite correction on the Sunday political
talk show circuit:
Rumsfeld Busted on Iraq Immediate Threat
Remarkably, the public at large has seemingly learned nothing from all of
these documented historical manipulations.
If anything, the media has become
even bolder in its attempts to manipulate the publics perceptions, perhaps
emboldened by the fact that so few in the audience seem willing to question
the picture that is being painted for them on the evening news.
Later that year, CNN aired footage of a bombed out Tskhinvali in South
Ossetia, falsely labeling it as footage of Gori,
which they said had been attacked by the Russians:
CNN lies about Georgian/Russian conflict
In 2009, the BBC showed a
cropped image of a rally in Iran which they
claimed was a crowd of protesters who assembled to show their opposition to
the Iranian government.
An uncropped version of the same photograph
displayed on the LA Times website, however, revealed that the photo in fact
came from a rally in support of Ahmedinejad.
In August of 2011, the BBC ran footage of what they claimed was a
celebration in Tripolis Green Square:
Libya
Incredible media lies - BBC shows "Green Square" in INDIA
24 August 2011
When sharp-eyed viewers noticed that
the flags in the footage were in fact Indian flags,
the BBC was forced to
admit that they had accidentally broadcast footage from India instead of
Tripoli.
Also that month,
CNN reported on a story from the Syrian Observatory for
Human Rights claiming that eight infants in incubators had died in a
hospital in Hama when Syrian authorities cut off power in the area.
Some
news sites even
carried pictures of the infants.
The images were
later
admitted to have been taken in Egypt and no evidence has ever emerged to
back up the accusations.
As breathtaking as all of these lies, manipulations and so-called mistakes
are, they in and of themselves dont represent the only functions of the
media for the war machine. Now, the US government is taking the lead in
becoming more and more directly involved with the shaping of the media
message on war propaganda, and the general public is becoming even more
ensnared in a false picture of the world through the Pentagons own lens.
In 2005, the
Bush White House admitted to producing videos that were
designed to look like news reports from legitimate independent journalists,
and then feeding those reports to media outlets as prepackaged material
ready to air on the evening news.
When the Government Accountability Office
ruled that these fake news reports in fact constituted illegal covert
propaganda, the White House simply issued a memo declaring the practice to
be legal.
In April 2008, the New York Times
revealed a secret US Department of Defense
program that was launched in 2002 and involved using retired military
officers to implant Pentagon talking points in the media. The officers were
presented as independent analysts on talk shows and news programs,
although they had been specially briefed beforehand by the Pentagon.
In
December of 2011, the DoDs own Inspector General
released a report
concluding that the program was in perfect compliance with government
policies and regulations.
Earlier this year,
it was revealed the the US government had contracted with HBGary Federal to develop software that create fake social media accounts in
order to steer public opinion and promote propaganda on popular websites.
The federal contract for the software sourced back to the MacDill Air Force
Base in Florida.
As the vehicle through which information from the outside world is captured,
sorted, edited and transmitted into our homes, the mass media has the huge
responsibility of shaping and informing our understanding of events to which
we dont have first-hand access.
This is an awesome responsibility in even
the most ideal conditions, with diligent reporters guided by trustworthy
editors doing their level best to report the most important news in the most
straightforward way.
But in a media landscape where a handful of companies (below image) own virtually all of
the print, radio and television media in each nation, the only recourse the
public has is to turn away from the mainstream media altogether.
And that is
precisely what is happening.
As
study after
study and
report after
report has shown, the death of the
old
media has accelerated in recent years, with more and more people abandoning
newspapers and now even television as their main source of news.
Instead,
the public is increasingly turning toward online sources for their news and
information, something that is necessarily worrying for the war machine
itself, a system that can only truly flourish when the propaganda arm is
held under monopolistic control.
But as citizens turn away from the New York Times and toward independent
websites, many run and maintained by citizen journalists and amateur
editors, the system that has consolidated its control over the minds of the
public for generations seems to finally be showing signs that it may not be
invincible.
Surely this is not to say that online media is impervious to the defects
that have made the traditional media so unreliable. Quite the contrary. But
the difference is that online, there is still for the time being relative
freedom of choice at the individual level.
While internet freedom exists,
individual readers and viewers dont have to take the word of any website or
pundit or commentator on any issue.
They can check the source documentation
themselves, except, perhaps not coincidentally, on the websites of the
traditional media bastions, which tend not to link source material and
documentation in their articles.
Hence the
SOPA Act,
Protect IP, the US governments attempts to
seize
websites at the domain name level, and all of the other concerted
attacks we
have seen on internet freedoms in recent years.
Because ultimately, an informed and engaged public is far less likely to go
along with wars waged for power and profit.
And as the public becomes better
informed about the very issues that the media has tried to lie to them about
for so long, they realize that the answer to all of
the mainstream medias
war cheerleading and blatant manipulation is perhaps simpler than we ever
suspected:
All we have to do is turn them off.

As the US and Iranian governments escalate tensions in the already volatile
Straits of Hormuz, and China and Russia begin openly questioning
Washington's interference in their internal politics, the world remains on a
knife-edge of military tension.
Far from being a dispassionate observer of
these developments, however, the media has in fact been central to
increasing those tensions and preparing the public to expect a military
confrontation.
But as the online media rises to displace the traditional
forms by which the public forms its understanding of the world, many are now
beginning to see first hand how the media lies the public into war.
