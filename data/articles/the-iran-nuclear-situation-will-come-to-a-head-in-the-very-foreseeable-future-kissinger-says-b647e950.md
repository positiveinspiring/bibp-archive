Henry
Kissinger recently gave an ominous forecast on the future of
Iran's nuclear program: that it will be taken care of one way or another
very soon.
Speaking at the
World Economic Forum
at a Swiss ski resort in Davos, Kissinger said,
"People who have advanced their view will
have to come to a determination about how to react or about the
consequences of non-reaction," he said.
"I believe this point will be reached within
a very foreseeable future."
Also at Davos, Agence France Presse
reports that President Shimon Peres said,
"There will be more attempts to try
and negotiate, but there will always be in the horizon a
military option, because
if the
Iranians think it's only economic and political, they won't pay
attention."
Kissinger, Peres and Defense Minister Ehud Barak
all seem to think that the Iran nuclear situation will come to close in some
way in the next few months.
However, exactly how that will happen remains a
subject of debate - where some see military threat and possible strikes as
integral, others report that sanctions have
crippled the country, opening up critical lanes for
upcoming nuclear talks with the U.N. Security Council.
One recent Haaratz report said that
Iran's income from oil had plummeted 50% in recent months, and the country
has been unable to find the space to store its excess oil. Iran's oil
represents 80 percent of its income, and the U.S. has almost unilaterally
banned the import of that oil.
On the other side, Iran's major importers are
Asian countries (though China is exempt, it still represents an ally) -
countries likely to, and more importantly,
able to, put pressure on the U.S. to drop sanctions.
While Iran may try to
delay and quibble over locations for the negotiation, it looks like
economic sanctions may well cause their hand to fold, and soon.
From
Haaratz:
Iran's leaders know the only route to ease the
economic pressures - and possibly undercut threats of military action on its
nuclear sites by Israel - is through potential deal-making with the six
world powers, which include the five permanent UN Security Council members
plus Germany.
