The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN),
responsible for controlling much of how the internet works, has stated that
they are moving away from the U.S. Department of Commerce, citing concerns
over "pervasive monitoring and surveillance."
The fallout from the revelations of the
surveillance programs run by the
National Security Agency (NSA)
continues to be seen with a new investigation in Luxembourg into
Skypes involvement with NSA surveillance programs.
Furthermore, the NSA chief himself recently
admitted that they put out misleading figures about the
number of terrorist plots foiled by
bulk collection of U.S. phone records.
ICANN and other major internet groups are
apparently not too happy about this surveillance, and are now making that
quite clear.
During a meeting in Montevideo, Uruguay, leaders
of ICANN, the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C), the Internet Architecture Board and others accused the U.S. of
undermining the trust of internet users.
Indeed, the NSAs reported ability to influence
the
encryption standards established by NIST
for easier cracking does not lend itself to a trusting relationship. Nor
does
going after the master encryption keys from
major internet companies.
The groups,
"expressed strong concern over the
undermining of the trust and confidence of Internet users globally due
to recent revelations of pervasive monitoring and surveillance," in a
joint statement.
The leaders,
"warned against Internet fragmentation at a
national level" and called for less control by the U.S. Department of
Commerce.
In the statement, the leaders,
"called for accelerating the globalization
of ICANN and IANA functions, towards an environment in which all
stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal
footing."
As of now, the Department of Commerce has
unilateral oversight of ICANN and a great deal of control.
Given that ICANN sets standards for how all
internet traffic flows through
international networks, that control is no minor thing.
The body also regulates how "top-level domains"
like .com, .net and .org work and how servers,
"translate numerical designations for IP
addresses into recognizable URLs," according to
Raw Story.
The ultimate responsibility of ICANN is to keep
the global internet from fracturing and segmenting into small, insular
networks that cannot be reached from outside the network.
The next
Internet Governance Summit will be
held in Brazil, a country that has been
quite critical of the United States internet
surveillance, as VentureBeat
points out.
"The United States and its allies must
urgently end their spying activities once and for all," Brazilian
President Dilma Rousseff said to reporters when the location of the next
summit was announced.
