An Iranian lawmaker says the Majlis (parliament)
Energy Committee has finalized a draft bill to stop the country's oil
exports to EU member states in reaction to the bloc's recent decision to ban
oil imports from Iran.
Nasser Soudani, deputy chairman of the committee, said on Saturday
that the double-urgency bill for halting Iran oil exports to Europe had been
finalized in four clauses.
According to one of the main clauses, the
Islamic Republic of Iran will halt all oil exports to European countries
as long as they continue to ban oil imports from Iran, he added.
The lawmaker said the bill may undergo further
modifications as some Iranian parliamentarians believe that oil exports
to EU should be stopped for five years.
Another clause obliges the government to
forbid imports of all goods from countries which have imposed sanctions
on our country, he added.
Soudani announced on January 25 that in reaction
to EU sanctions against Iran's oil sector and central bank, Iranian
lawmakers were drafting a new law to stop oil supply to European countries.
During their latest meeting in Brussels on January 23, EU foreign ministers
reached an agreement to ban oil imports from Iran, freeze the country's
central bank's assets within EU, and ban sales of diamonds, gold and other
precious metals to Iran.
EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, claimed that the new
sanctions aim to bring Iran back to negotiations with P5+1,

... over the country's peaceful nuclear program.
The United States, Israel and their European allies accuse Tehran of
pursuing military objectives in its nuclear program and have used this
pretext to impose four rounds of international and a series of unilateral
sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
Iran has refuted the allegations, arguing that as a signatory to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and a member of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, Tehran has a right to use nuclear technology for peaceful use.
