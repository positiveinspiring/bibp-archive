It has come to this:
Argentina has until November to change it's
statistics on inflation and GDP or get kicked out of
the International Monetary Fund.
This story goes back to 2007, when late
Argentine President Nestor Kirchner fired the statisticians in INDEC (the
Argentine Bureau of Statistics) and replaced them.
Since then the country has reported inflation
numbers that differ wildly from those of independent analysts - a difference
of 10% versus 25% (check
out some charts on that here).
To keep up this charade, the government has
fined statisticians that release numbers that contradict INDEC's. To current
president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's administration, these
people are criminals.
And the IMF is tired of this. At the end of last
year the body's Executive Board discussed what they would do with the
country. Last night they made an official decision.
Argentina must change its ways or join
Czechoslovakia as the only countries to ever be forced out of the IMF and
lose the funding that comes with that. Argentina could also lose its status
as a G20 country.
Here's the
release from the IMF:
The IMFs Executive Board met on February 1,
2013 to consider the Managing Directors report on Argentinas progress in
implementing remedial measures to address the quality of the official data
reported to the Fund for the Consumer Price Index for Greater Buenos Aires
(CPI-GBA) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The Executive Board found that Argentinas progress in implementing the
remedial measures since the September 17, 2012 Board meeting (see Press
Release No. 12/319) has not been sufficient.
As a result, the Fund has
issued a declaration of censure against Argentina in connection with its
breach of obligation to the Fund under the Articles of Agreement.
The Board
called on Argentina to adopt the remedial measures to address the inaccuracy
of CPI-GBA and GDP data without further delay, and in any event, no later
than September 29, 2013.
The measures applicable to the CPI-GBA and GDP
aim at aligning these indicators with the international statistical
understandings and guidelines that ensure accurate measurement.
The Managing Director
is required to report to the Executive Board by November 13, 2013 on the
status of Argentinas implementation of the above remedial measures. At that
time, the Executive Board will again review this issue and Argentinas
response in line with IMF procedures.
The Fund stands ready to continue its dialogue with the Argentine
authorities to improve the quality of the official CPI-GBA and GDP data,
and, more generally, to strengthen the relationship between Argentina and
the Fund.
The Kirchner administration is, as ever,
defiant.
They continue to insist that the IMF is out
of line and released this communiqué in response to the ruling
requesting a meeting with the IMF to discuss it (Telam
reports).
...Economy Minister Hernán Lorenzino said that
the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) criticism to Argentina's
statistical system is a clear example of unequal treatment and of double
standard on the part of the monetary institution in its relationship with
some of its member countries.
The Argentine
Government requested an extraordinary meeting of the Board of Governors of
the IMF, to review its policy towards our country as well as its performance
and responsibility in the world economic and financial crisis, said the
Ministry's communiqué.
It also reminded that,
Argentina is the same country that in the
nineties, during the convertibility system, was presented by the IMF as
the best example of an economic model, which wound up in the most
serious institutional and economic crisis in the history of our nation.
"Such
a stand regarding Argentina is not only an error on the part of the IMF,
but also a clear example of an unequal treatment and double standard of
this organism in its relationship with certain member countries. It is
the same Fund that shows complacency towards inaccurate facts and
policies that led to the global crisis.
An
IMF that despite being aware that its recipes do not work, does not
repent from its prescriptions, remarked
the Ministry of Economy.
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is not known for
standing down.
She is not known for changing her mind. She is
not known for accepting the measures of international agencies that she
considers harmful to her country's interest.
Expect a fight.
