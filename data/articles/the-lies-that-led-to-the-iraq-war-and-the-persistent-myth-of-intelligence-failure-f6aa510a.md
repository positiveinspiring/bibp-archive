Secretary of State
Colin Powell
presents the Bush
administrations case for war on Iraq
at the U.N. Security Council
on February 5, 2003
The George Washington University National Security Archive recently
published a newly released CIA document from January 2006 titled Misreading
Intentions - Iraqs Reaction to Inspection Created Picture of Deception.
The document, the Archive
notes,
blames analyst liabilities such as
neglecting to examine Iraqs deceptive behavior through an Iraqi
prism, for the failure to correctly assess the countrys virtually
non-existent WMD capabilities.
Foreign Policy magazine
describes it as a remarkable CIA mea
culpa.
But nothing could be further from the truth. Far
from acknowledging the CIAs true role, the document does not present any
kind of serious analysis, but only politicized statements rehashing
well-worn official claims designed to further the myth that there was an
intelligence failure leading up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March of
2003.
There was no such intelligence failure.
On the contrary, there was an extremely
successful disinformation campaign coordinated by the CIA in furtherance of
the governments policy of seeking regime change in Iraq. The language of
the document itself reveals a persistent dishonesty.
It speaks of,
deepened suspicions that Iraq had ongoing
WMD programs and suspicions that Iraq continued to hide WMD.
Needless to say, however, the Iraq war was not
sold to the public on the grounds that government officials and intelligence
agencies had suspicions that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
It was sold to the public with declarations that
it was a known fact that Iraq had ongoing programs and stockpiles of WMD.
The tacit acknowledgment that the actual evidence only supported
suspicions that this was so by itself is proof of that the narrative of an
intelligence failure is a fiction.
The report relies heavily upon the 1995 defection of
Saddam Husseins
son-in-law,
Hussein Kamal (respectively spelled Saddam Husayn and Husayn
Kamil in the document), arguing that the information he revealed bolstered
suspicions that Iraq was concealing ongoing WMD programs and continued to
possess stockpiles of WMD.
It argues further that the regimes behavior
indicated he was hiding such weapons. Kamal, who returned to Iraq and was
killed there in 1996, was the same individual Vice President Dick Cheney
referred to in selling the administrations case for war on August 26, 2002,
when he said that we now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to
acquire nuclear weapons.
Among other sources, weve gotten this from the
firsthand testimony of defectors - including Saddams own son-in-law, who
was subsequently murdered at Saddams direction. But the fact is that
Cheney was lying, and the CIAs persistent adherence to essentially the same
false narrative renders ridiculous the suggestion that this document is some
kind of mea culpa.
The document states,
Analysts interpreted Iraqs intransigence
and ongoing deceptive practices as indicators of continued WMD programs
or an intent to preserve WMD capabilities, reinforcing intelligence we
were receiving at the time that Saddam Husayn continued to pursue WMD.
Yet the examples it lists of Iraqs
intransigence and deception do not support the CIAs earlier judgments
that Iraq had ongoing programs and WMD stockpiles.
In April 1991, for example, the document
says, Iraq declared that it had neither a nuclear weapons program nor
an enrichment program. Inspections in June and September 1991 proved
that Iraq had lied on both counts, had explored multiple enrichment
paths, and had a well-developed nuclear weapons program.
This is true.
However, the document makes no mention of the
fact that it was public knowledge that Iraqs nuclear program was
subsequently completely dismantled.
As former Director General of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
Mohammed ElBaradei, pointed out, the
Agency had,
destroyed, removed or rendered harmless all
Iraqi facilities and equipment component of Iraqs nuclear program by
1992.
The IAEA reported in 1998 that it was confident
that we had not missed any significant component of Iraqs nuclear program.
The document states that in,
March 1992, Iraq decided to declare the
unilateral destruction of certain prohibited items to the Security
Council, while continuing to conceal its biological warfare (BW) program
and important aspects of the nuclear, chemical, and missile programs.
As worded, this implies that Iraq in 1992 was
continuing these programs.
This is disingenuous, because in fact Iraq was
at that time trying conceal past programs that it had ended following the
1991 Gulf War. Iraq did not continue these programs, but dismantled them and
unilaterally destroyed its WMD in order to hide the fact that it had had
such programs in the past.
As the document acknowledges in its Key
Findings section,
in 1991, Iraq secretly destroyed or
dismantled most undeclared items and records.
Yet the very next paragraph contradictorily and
disingenuously states,
We now judge that the 1995 defection of
Saddams son-in-law Husayn Kamil - a critical figure in Iraqs WMD and
denial and deception (D&D) activities - promoted Iraq to change
strategic direction and cease efforts to retain WMD programs.
This again implies that Iraq had ongoing WMD
programs at least until 1995, which is false, as the CIA knew perfectly well
at the time this report was written.
Even more importantly, that the programs had been dismantled and the weapons
destroyed is in fact precisely what Hussein Kamal actually told U.N.
inspectors when he defected in 1995.
The newly released document in fact points out,
He said that Saddam destroyed all WMD in
secret in 1991.
Yet apart from that single buried admission, the
document is full of statements implying that weapons programs continued.
For example, it states that,
Iraqi officials did not admit to weaponized
BW agent after the defection of Husayn Kamil, but fails to clarify that
this was an admission of past and not ongoing activity.
The document acknowledges that Kamals defection
was,
the key turning point in Iraqs decision to
cooperate more with inspections, but then adds that his debriefing with
U.N. inspectors strengthened the Wests perception of Iraq as a
successful and efficient deceiver.
Following Kamals defection, the document
states, the West, meaning the U.S., judged that Iraq was determined to
retain WMD capabilities.
In other words, the U.S. continued to claim that
Iraq had ongoing WMD programs and stockpiles, and supposedly based that
assessment on Kamals information, even though Kamal in fact had confirmed
that Iraqs WMD had been destroyed and its programs dismantled in 1991.
The document similarly states,
We now judge that the Iraqis feared that
Kamil
would reveal additional undisclosed information. Iraq decided
that further widespread deception and attempts to hold onto extensive
WMD programs while under UN sanctions was untenable and changed
strategic direction by adopting a policy of disclosure and improved
cooperation.
The wording here that Iraq was attempting in
1995 to hold onto such programs does not merely imply a falsehood, but is
an outright lie.
Once again,
the CIA was perfectly well aware
that until 1995, Iraq was attempting to conceal the existence of its past WMD programs, which it was not attempting to hold onto but had dismantled
in 1991.
This kind of dishonest use of language to
suggest Iraq continued to have ongoing WMD programs, even while
contradictorily acknowledging elsewhere in the report that this was not
true, is illustrative not of a willingness by the CIA to come clean, but to
continue to obfuscate the truth and to persist in the false narrative of
intelligence failure.
The CIA in the document even tries to spin its
acknowledgment that Iraqs programs were dismantled and its WMD destroyed in
1991 by saying that this unilateral action left Iraq,
unable to provide
convincing proof when it later tried to demonstrate compliance,
...thus
shifting the burden onto Iraq to prove that it didnt have WMD and
attempting to obfuscate the fact that U.S. government officials repeatedly
lied by claiming that the intelligence community had proof that Iraq did
have WMD.
In October 1991, Iraq admitted to the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) that
its Al Atheer site had been built in order to conduct research into
enriching uranium to build a nuclear weapon.
On August 22, 1995, when Hussein Kamal
was asked about the work that went on there, and whether it was continuing
somewhere else, he replied,
yes, but not now, before the Gulf War.
That is to say, there were other sites involved
in Iraqs nuclear weapons program, but this program was ended by 1991.
He also pointed out that the work done on
enrichment were only studies.
He noted that Iraq already,
had highly enriched uranium from France but
it was under the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards.
Iraq thus had worked on building its own
centrifuges to enrich uranium,
but had never reached a point close to
testing.
The CIA document nevertheless states that
Kamals defection,
exposed the previously unknown 1991 crash
program to develop nuclear weapons.
The program referred to would have entailed
using enriched uranium from Iraqs French-built reactor and enriching
additional uranium obtained from Russia to weapons-grade in order to produce
material for a bomb.
The remarkable dishonesty of this statement is
on full display when one compares it with the fact that, when this crash
program was brought up in his UNSCOM debriefing, Kamals actual response
was,
no, not true.
He acknowledged that,
the decision was already there to use
French uranium, but they were not ready with centrifuges.
In other words, the crash program was nothing
more than a hypothetical contingency plan involving a scenario in which Iraq
would make a final desperate effort to produce a nuclear weapon by kicking
out U.N. and IAEA inspectors and enriching its own uranium to weapons-grade
- a capability Iraq did not possess.
With regard to Iraqs biological weapons programs, Kamal was asked during
his debriefing,
[W]ere weapons and agents destroyed? He
answered, [N]othing remained. He added that the U.N. inspectors have
[an] important role in Iraq with this. You should not underestimate
yourself. You are very effective in Iraq.
The unilateral destruction of WMD, Kamal said,
was done before you came in.
On the issue of chemical weapons, the discussion
turned to Iraqs development of VX nerve agent during the Iran-Iraq war.
After the war, Kamal told his U.N. debriefers,
the factory was turned into civilian
production. He added, Iran also had mustard and sarin and they used
mustard [gas] in small quantities. Some of the chemical components came
for the US to Iraq - that the U.S. supplied precursors for Iraqs WMD
is well known.
Kamal continued, [W]e changed the factory
into pesticide production. Part of the establishment started to produce
medicine.
He also said, We gave instructions not to
produce chemical weapons
All chemical weapons were destroyed. I ordered
destruction of all chemical weapons. All weapons - biological, chemical,
missile, nuclear were destroyed.
(He subsequently clarified, in the nuclear
area, there were no weapons - he had meant that the nuclear program was
dismantled.)
The CIA document repeats the standard refrain that Iraq viewed Iran and
Israel as a threat and that this therefore,
could explain why Iraq might have continued
to give the impression that it was concealing WMD - to instill fear or
at least uncertainty in their neighbors.
The propaganda claim that Iraq itself wished to
give the impression that it had WMD has been repeated many times over the
years.
David Kay, who initially headed up the
Iraq Survey Group (ISG), the CIAs effort to find WMD in Iraq following the
invasion, in order to explain why the search had turned up nothing,
suggested that Saddam had bluffed about having WMD in order to deter Iran.
In January 2008, the media was abuzz with the
supposed revelation from Saddams interrogation confirming that he had
bluffed.
His interrogator, FBI agent George Piro,
gave an interview with CBSs 60 Minutes in which he recalled telling Saddam,
And in June 2000 you gave a speech in which
you said Iraq would not disarm until others in the region did.
The 60 Minutes report then inserted the claim,
That June 2000 speech was about weapons of
mass destruction.
Piro reinforced that claim when the interviewer
asked him why Saddam would put his nation at risk to maintain this charade
of having WMD, to which Piro replied,
It was very important for him to project
that because that was what kept him, in his mind, in power. That
capability kept the Iranians away. It kept them from reinvading Iraq.
The Associated Press reported that Saddams
interrogation confirmed that he,
falsely allowed the world to believe Iraq
has weapons of mass destruction.
USA Today claimed that Saddam,
said he was bluffing publicly about having
weapons of mass destruction because he feared showing weakness to Iran.
The headline in the Christian Science Monitor
declared,
Why Saddam Hussein lied about Iraqs
weapons of mass destruction.
The London Telegraph proclaimed,
Saddam Hussein lied about WMDs to protect
Iraq from Iran.
Reuters announced,
FBI: Saddam told us he lied about having
nukes to deter Iran.
But in fact the only lie was the claim that
Saddam had lied about having WMD.
The simple fact of the matter is that he never
once claimed that Iraq had WMD. On the contrary, he repeatedly,
consistently, and honestly denied this (the CIA document acknowledges in one
place that what Iraq was saying by the end of 1995 was, for the most part,
accurate).
The entire relevant section from the released FBI summary of the June 11,
2004 interrogation Piro was referring to stated,
SSA Piro then asked Hussein if he wrote his
own speeches and they come from the heart, then what was the meaning of
his June 2000 speech. Hussein replied this speech was meant to serve a
regional and operational purpose.
Regionally, the speech was meant to respond
to Iraqs regional threat. Hussein believed that Iraq could not appear
weak to its enemies, especially Iran. Iraq was being threatened by
others in the region and must appear able to defend itself.
Operationally, Hussein was demonstrating
Iraqs compliance with the United Nations (UN) in its destruction of its
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).
That was very far from suggesting any kind of
confession from Saddam that he had bluffed about having WMD.
Furthermore, the speech referred to, contrary to CBSs false claim, was not
about WMD. Saddam rather had spoken explicitly with reference to Iraqs
conventional arsenal of weapons.
He spoke of how the U.S. had used the United
Nations as a cover to pursue its own agenda and then added,
However, we must protect our country
because we will not give them Iraq. We do not like to collect weapons
for the sake of collecting weapons. But we consider the provision of the
necessary means to protect our country an ethical and moral
responsibility that every Iraqi man and woman must shoulder.
He was thus speaking specifically of Iraqs
right to self-defense and of maintaining a capability to exercise that
right.
He continued on to say that Iraq would be most
enthusiastic to limit its weapons, so long as Israel - which had bombed
Iraq in 1983, a watershed event that precipitated Saddams decision to try
to develop a nuclear weapon to deter any further such attacks - did the
same:
We told President Husni Mubarak: You can go
ahead and announce that the Arabs are prepared to join any treaty to rid
the region of the so-called weapons of mass destruction. We told him:
This does not mean only ballistic missiles, which are no more than
artillery of a longer range.
The condition for this proposed disarmament was,
that the Zionist entity is the first to
sign such a treaty.
And while Saddam had used the words weapons of
mass destruction, he was explicitly referring to long-range ballistic
missiles, which, although proscribed for Iraq under
United
Nations resolutions, were
nevertheless conventional weapons - hence his description of them as
so-called WMD.
If the world tells us to abandon all our
weapons and keep only swords, Saddam continued, we will do that. We
will destroy all the weapons, if they destroy their weapons. But if they
keep a rifle and then tell me that I have the right to possess only a
sword, then we would say no.
The CIA document concludes that intelligence
analysts had wrongly assessed Iraqs WMD capabilities on the grounds that:
A liability of intelligence analysis is
that once a party has been proven to be an effective deceiver, that
knowledge becomes a heavy factor in the calculations of the analytical
observer.
But, remarkably, while making vague judgments
about the bias of analysts such as this one, the document does not address
any of the actual intelligence underlying a single one of the claims made by
government officials in their efforts to manufacture consent for the war on
Iraq.
An examination of the claims that were made and
the actual intelligence underlying them reveals the fact that, for the most
part, the intelligence community had not failed in its assessments of Iraqs
WMD capabilities.
On the contrary, the top analysts in their
respective area of expertise on numerous key claims from the Bush
administration in making its case for war had correctly assessed that Iraq
had no such WMD capabilities.
How the CIA
Coordinated a Campaign of Disinformation
For instance, take the claims that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear
program, belied by open-source information from the IAEA that it had been
completely dismantled and that there was no evidence that Iraq had attempted
to restart it.
The evidence cited to bolster these claims
were founded primarily on alleged Iraqi attempts to procure yellowcake
uranium from Niger and acquisition of aluminum tubes to manufacture
centrifuges to enrich the uranium for a bomb.
Yet both of these claims were false and were
known to be false before the U.S. invaded. And in neither case did the
intelligence communitys assessment support the claims made by
administration officials.
President
George W. Bush infamously proclaimed,
for example, that,
The British government has learned that
Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from
Africa.
This was a lie.
The British government hadnt learned that; it
merely claimed this was so with no credible evidence. In fact, the U.S.
intelligence community regarded this claim as so dubious that the CIA had
warned the British government against including it in the white paper Bush
was referring to.
In fact, the documents underlying the claim were
forgeries.
The documents were eventually handed over to the
IAEA, and in his briefing to the U.N. Security Council on March 7, 2003,
Mohammed ElBaradei announced,
Based on thorough analysis, the IAEA has
concluded, with the concurrence of outside experts, that these documents
- which formed the basis for the reports of recent uranium transactions
between Iraq and Niger - are in fact not authentic.
The role of the CIA in controlling the flow of
information in the coordinated effort to deceive the public is best
illustrated in the case of the aluminum tubes.
Dick Cheney declared that Saddam
Hussein,
has reconstituted his nuclear program to
develop a nuclear weapon
[H]e now is trying, through his illicit
procurement network, to acquire the equipment he needs to be able to
enrich uranium to make the bombs
Specifically aluminum tubes.
He added, [W]e do know, with absolute
certainty, that he is using his procurement system to acquire the
equipment he needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear
weapon.
He went further, suggesting that Iraq may have
already obtained a nuclear weapon.
When asked to confirm that Iraq did not at that
time have a nuclear weapon, Cheney replied,
I cant say that.
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice
similarly lied,
We do know that he is actively pursuing a
nuclear weapon. We do know that there have been shipments going
into
Iraq, for instance, of aluminum tubes
that are only really suited for
nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs.
President Bush also said,
Iraq has made several attempts to buy
high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear
weapon.
The same day, the State Department released a
report titled A Decade of Deception and Defiance that stated,
Iraq has sought to buy thousands of
specially designed aluminum tubes which officials believe were intended
as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium.
On October 7, 2002, Bush repeated,
The evidence indicates that Iraq is
reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.
He cited as evidence of this the claim that,
Iraq has attempted to purchase
high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas
centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.
He added,
Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot
wait for the final proof - the smoking gun - that could come in the form
of a mushroom cloud.
Turning to the actual assessments of the U.S.s
intelligence agencies, the first CIA assessment of the tubes was published
on April 10, 2001, and stated that they have little use other than for a
uranium enrichment program.
Yet no explanation for how this conclusion was
arrived at was provided, and the report also acknowledged that,
using aluminum tubes in a centrifuge effort
would be inefficient and a step backward from the specialty steel
machines Iraq was poised to mass produce at the onset of the Gulf War.
The Department of Energy (DOE) issued their own
far more detailed analysis of the tubes the following day, which stated that
their specifications are not consistent with a gas centrifuge end use.
Additionally, there was no evidence for related
procurement efforts that would be also required to produce centrifuges, and
if the tubes were intended for this purpose, it would be,
a centrifuge
design quite different from any Iraq is known to have.
The DOE report stated,
[W]e assess that the procurement activity
more likely supports a different application, such as conventional
ordnance production. For example, the tube specifications and quantity
appear to be generally consistent with their use as launch tubes for
man-held anti-armor rockets or as tactical rocket casings.
Additionally, the lax manner in which Iraq had
handled its procurement of the tubes,
seems to better match our expectations for
a conventional Iraqi military buy than a major purchase for a
clandestine weapons-of-mass destruction program.
After further research, the DOE issued another
report on May 9 noting that,
Iraq has purchased similar aluminum tubes
previously to manufacture chambers (tubes) for a multiple rocket
launcher.
The CIA responded with a report on June 14
acknowledging the error of its initial assessment.
It admitted that the tubes,
could be used as rocket bodies for multiple
rocket launchers, but nevertheless clung to its false claim that their
specifications are suitable for uranium enrichment gas centrifuge
rotors and that a conventional use was less likely.
Once again, no rationale was offered for its
differing assessment from the nations top experts on centrifuges at the
DOE.
The CIA issued another report on July 2 falsely
claiming that they,
are constructed from high strength aluminum
(7075-T6) and are manufactured to the tight tolerances necessary for gas
centrifuges. The dimensions of the tubes match those of a publicly
available gas centrifuge design from the 1950s, known as the Zippe
centrifuge.
It falsely stated that,
the specifications for the tubes far exceed
any known conventional weapons application, including rocket motor
casings for 81-mm multiple rocket launchers.
The IAEA first became alerted to the tubes issue
in the summer of 2001, and immediately recognized that Iraq had previously
used tubes with identical dimensions in a conventional rocket program, for
which there was extensive documentation.
A CIA analyst from the Center for Weapons
Intelligence, Nonproliferation, and Arms Control (WINPAC) identified simply
as Joe, was largely responsible for creating and propagating the argument
that the tubes were intended for a centrifuge program.
He travelled to Vienna in July to try to
convince the IAEA experts of his position, arguing that after cutting the
tubes and machining down the thickness, they could be used in a centrifuge
that would then have the same mass as rotors in a Zippe centrifuge design
(named after Soviet scientist Gernot Zippe).
The IAEA experts pointed out to him that there
were numerous flaws in his analysis, such as the fact that he had failed to
calculate the mass of end caps and other components of such a design.
As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report on the U.S.
Intelligence Communitys Prewar Intelligence Assessment on Iraq would later
observe, nine additional intelligence reports were produced over the next
year discussing the aluminum tubes, but,
[n]one of these assessments provided any
additional information to support the CIAs analysis.
The Senate Committees report offered useful
insight into how the CIA was controlling the flow of information on the
tubes, revealing how,
Most of the assessments were disseminated
in limited channels, only to high-level policymakers and were not
available to intelligence analysts from other agencies.
When asked by the Committee why this was so, CIA
officials replied that they were written as responses to specific questions
and intended for the President.
Apparently relying on the CIAs false claim that
the tubes were a match to the Zippe design and being out of the loop about
the DOEs contrary assessment, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
produced a report on August 2, 2001 embracing the CIAs case with the
comment that,
DIA analysts found the CIA WINPAC
presentation to be very compelling.
On August 17, the DOE released an additional
extensive analysis, once again observing, as had the IAEA, that Iraq had
previously used tubes with the same specifications to manufacture rockets.
The DOE reiterated that the tubes were not well
suited for a centrifuge and that the aluminum used,
provides performance roughly half that of
the materials Iraq previously pursued.
Furthermore, the diameter of the tubes was
smaller than any known centrifuge and,
too thick for favorable use as rotor tubes,
exceeding the nominal 1-mm thickness of known aluminum rotor tubes by
more than a factor of three.
In other words, as the Senate Committee later
noted,
The dimensions of the tubes seized do not
match the dimensions of any of Zippes centrifuge designs.
Moreover, the DOE also noted, the anodized
surface,
is not consistent with a gas centrifuge
application, which was unlikely. Rather, a rocket production
application is the more likely end use for these tubes.
Apparently still relying entirely upon the CIAs
assessment, the DIA issued a report in November acknowledging that,
alternative uses for the tubes are
possible, such as rocket motor cases or rocket launch tubes but
parroting once again the false claim that the specifications are
consistent with earlier Iraqi gas centrifuge rotor designs.
The DOE tried to set the record straight yet
again in a report in December that stated,
The wall thickness is three times greater
than that for metal rotor designs used in high-speed centrifuges -
including the Zippe design.
The DOEs experts pointed out the inefficiency
of any centrifuge built using these tubes, concluding,
In short, we judge it unlikely that anyone
could deploy an enrichment facility capable of producing weapons
significant quantities of HEU [highly-enriched uranium] based on these
tubes.
One analyst later expressed his view to the
Senate Committee that if Iraq truly intended these tubes for use in a
centrifuge, then,
we should just give them the tubes.
The CIA was undeterred, publishing another report on August 1, 2002 ignoring
the DOE assessment and claiming that the tubes supposed high tolerances,
high cost, and secrecy in procurement were evidence that they were intended
for centrifuges.
The DIA the following month once again repeated
the false claim that alternative uses were possible but,
less likely because the specifications are
consistent with late-1980s Iraqi gas centrifuge rotor designs.
Again in September, the CIA repeated as evidence
for an intended centrifuge application its false claims of secrecy in
procurement, high cost, tight tolerances, the anodized coating, and that the
tubes matched known centrifuge specifications. It concluded that it was
unlikely they were intended for a rocket program.
While administration officials stated as fact that the tubes were intended
for centrifuges and that they couldnt be used for any other purpose, that
the nations top experts on centrifuges at the DOE disagreed became public
information long before the invasion of Iraq.
David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) released a report on September 23,
2002 that noted,
In fact, the intelligence community is
deeply divided about the purpose of the tubing, with a significant
number of experts knowledgeable about gas centrifuges dissenting from
the CIA view.
Furthermore, Albright wrote,
ISIS has learned that U.S. nuclear experts
who dissent from the Administrations position are expected to remain
silent.
In a second later report, Albright relayed that
one expert,
said that people in the administration can
release whatever they like, and they expect us to be silent.
The New York Times similarly later reported that
on September 13, after the administration had leaked information about the
tubes to the press and made their rounds on the talk shows touting their
claims,
the Energy Department sent a directive
forbidding employees from discussing the subject with reporters.
Albright also made publicly known that the tubes
would have to be modified significantly in order to be used for centrifuges,
and also that UNSCOM had seen thousands of similar tubes in Iraq - for use
in its rocket program.
Further public information contradicting the
U.S. governments claims came when the British government released a dossier
on September 24, 2002 admitting that,
there is no definitive intelligence that it
is destined for a nuclear program.
The CIA released an unclassified version of its
National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraqi WMD in October 2002, which
stated that the tubes,
could be used in a centrifuge enrichment
program. Most intelligence specialists assess this to be to be the
intended use, but some believe that these tubes are probably intended
for conventional weapons programs.
Thus most intelligence specialists included
Joe and a number of analysts within the CIA and DIA, while excluding the
nations top experts on centrifuges who had repeatedly pointed out that the
CIA and DIA assessments were relying on false information.
By contrast, the classified version of the NIE noted that the DOE assesses
that the tubes probably are not part of a nuclear weapons program.
The State Departments Bureau of Intelligence
and Research (INR), it also noted,
accepts the judgment of technical experts
at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) who have concluded that the tubes
Iraq seeks to acquire are poorly suited for use in gas centrifuges to be
used for uranium enrichment and finds unpersuasive the arguments
advanced by others to make the case that they are intended for that
purpose.
INR considers it far more likely that the
tubes are intended for another purpose, most likely the production of
artillery rockets.
The very large quantities being sought, the
way the tubes were tested by the Iraqis, and the atypical lack of
attention to operational security in the procurement efforts are among
the factors, in addition to the DOE assessment, that lead INR to
conclude that the tubes are not intended for use in Iraqs nuclear
weapon program.
The NIE included an assessment from the Army
National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) that, due to the tubes
specifications, they were highly unlikely to be intended for rocket motor
cases.
Yet the IAEA had confirmed that the Iraqis were
attempting to reverse engineer an Italian rocket, the Medusa, which used the
same material, 7075-T6 aluminum tubes with the same dimensions.
Furthermore, in a written response to the Senate
Committee, the NGIC acknowledged that,
lightweight rockets, such as those
originally developed for air-to-ground systems, typically use 7075-T6
aluminum for the motor casing because of its strength and weight.
The NGIC additionally acknowledged that,
it is not unusual to use the aluminum alloy
specified by Iraq for casings of unguided rockets.
The apparent explanation for the contradiction
was once again the CIAs control of information.
One expert told David Albright that he did not
believe the CIA analysts presented NGIC with complete information about the
case prior to the publication of the NIE.
The Department of Defense (DOD) similarly
confirmed that the information its analysts had relied upon had been
provided by the CIA. One engineer from the DOD told the Senate Committee
that it became clear to him that the CIA had an agenda and was trying to
bias us, to encourage us to come up with [the] answer that agreed with
their own assessment.
With regard to the claim that the tubes were excessively tightly tolerance
for use in rockets, a DOD rocket design engineer told the Committee that
this could be explained because Iraqi engineers, who,
dont have 40 years of rocket manufacture
[experience] like we have, would tend to err on the conservative
side.
Another engineer agreed,
If you were starting from scratch, you
would tend to go for a straighter, more tightly-toleranced product.
The DOE observed that this was common practice
for inexperienced engineers trying to reverse engineer equipment, and the
IAEA also confirmed this explanation.
Further illustrating the dishonesty of the CIAs
assessment, the DOE explained that the tubes used in the U.S. Mark-66 rocket
in fact had tolerances that exceeded those of the tubes procured by the
Iraqis. As for the supposed high cost of the tubes, DOD design engineers
responsible for U.S. rocket systems told the Senate Committee that this was
not correct at all.
On the contrary, high-strength aluminum is,
around the world the material of choice for
low cost rocket systems and one of the cheapest materials to make
rocket motor cases.
The CIA claimed in the NIE that it had
successfully spun one of the tubes and that its test showed that it was
suitable as a centrifuge rotor, even though the DOE had written an
analysis of the spin test stating that it actually,
would have precluded their use in a
centrifuge.
The NIE did not repeat the false claim that the
tubes were a match to the Zippe design, but did claim their dimensions
were similar, and it omitted the fact that they were not consistent with
Iraqs previous centrifuge designs and the fact that the tubes
specifications matched perfectly those used in Iraqs existing rocket
program.
After U.N. inspectors returned to Iraq under the Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), chief inspector Hans Blix
reported in December 2002 that while it was still investigating the
administrations claims,
Iraq has also provided information on a
short-range rocket that is manufactured using 81 mm aluminum tubes,
which was not a new disclosure.
In January 2003, Mohamed ElBaradei briefed the
Security Council that Iraq had explained its attempts to acquire the tubes,
in connection with a program aimed at
reverse engineering 81-millimetre rockets.
In order to verify the Iraqi explanation, the
IAEA had conducted an extensive investigation finding that,
the specifications of the aluminum tubes
sought by Iraq
appear to be consistent with reverse engineering of
rockets. While it would be possible to modify such tubes for the
manufacture of centrifuges, they are not directly suitable for it.
The assessment of the DOE, as already noted, had
already been made public, and the INRs agreement with the DOE was also
reported by the New York Times in January.
On January 27, ElBaradei briefed the Council
again that after extensive investigation, the IAEA had concluded that,
the aluminum tubes would be consistent with
the purpose stated by Iraq and, unless modified, would not be suitable
for manufacturing centrifuges.
He added that,
we have to date found no evidence that Iraq
has revived its nuclear weapons programme since the elimination of the
programme in the 1990s.
President Bush nevertheless claimed two days
later that Saddam Hussein,
has attempted to purchase high-strength
aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production and that he has
not credibly explained these activities.
Secretary of State Colin Powell repeated
the administrations case at the Security Council on February 5, declaring
that,
Saddam Hussein is determined to get his
hands on a nuclear bomb. He is so determined that he has made repeated
covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes.
While acknowledging that there are differences
of opinion about the tubes, Powell claimed that,
Most U.S. experts think they are intended
to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium.
The truth was that, as David Albright later
observed,
The vast majority of gas centrifuge experts
in this country and abroad who are knowledgeable about this case reject
the CIAs case, including the nations top experts at the DOE who had
virtually the only expertise on gas centrifuges and nuclear weapons
programs in the United States government, as well as the intelligence
branch of Powells own State Department.
Powell disingenuously and meaninglessly declared
that,
all the experts who have analyzed the tubes
in our possession agree that they can be adapted for centrifuge use.
As one DOE analyst would later explain to the
Senate Committee, you could also theoretically turn your new Yugo into a
Cadillac.
Retired Oak Ridge nuclear scientist Dr.
Houston G. Wood, one of the top experts in the world on centrifuges,
similarly explained that,
it would have been extremely difficult to
make these tubes into centrifuges. It stretches the imagination to come
up with a way. I do not know any real centrifuge experts that feel
differently.
Powell lied that the tubes are manufactured to
a tolerance that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets, even
though his own departments intelligence agency had sent him a memo
identifying this claim as a key concern and stating,
In fact, the most comparable US system is a
tactical rocket - the US Mark 66 air-launched 70mm rocket - that uses
the same, high-grade (7075-T6) aluminum, and that has specifications
with similar tolerances.
He cited the anodized coating as evidence,
asking why Iraq would,
go to all that trouble for something that,
if it was a rocket, would soon be blown into shrapnel when it went off?
In fact, the anodized coating was a clear
indication the tubes were intended for rockets, the coating being to protect
the tubes from the weather; and since the tubes would require machining to
modify them for use in centrifuges, Powell, if he was honest, should have
asked why the Iraqis would go to all that trouble if the coating would soon
be removed to make centrifuges anyways.
Mohammed ElBaradei refuted Powells lies again in March, saying that,
Extensive field investigation and document
analysis have failed to uncover any evidence that Iraq intended to use
these 81mm tubes for any project other than the reverse engineering of
rockets
Based on available evidence, the IAEA team
has concluded that Iraqs efforts to import these aluminum tubes were
not likely to have been related to the manufacture of centrifuges and,
moreover, that it was highly unlikely that Iraq could have achieved the
considerable re-design needed to use them in a revived centrifuge
program.
Thus, even before the U.S. launched its invasion
of Iraq ostensibly to rid it of WMD because the world could not wait for the
proof of Iraqs possession of nuclear weapons to come in the form of a
mushroom cloud (below video), it was public knowledge that the British government, the IAEA, the top U.S. experts on centrifuges at the DOE, and the INR all agreed
that the evidence did not indicate that the tubes were intended for use in a
nuclear weapons program.
On July 9, 2004, the Senate Committee published
its report on pre-war intelligence.
It concluded that,
the judgment in the National Intelligence
Estimate (NIE), that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program, was
not supported by the intelligence and, furthermore, that the
information available to the Intelligence Community indicated that these
tubes were intended to be used for an Iraqi conventional rocket program
and not a nuclear program.
In the CIAs final report on the findings of the
ISG in September 2004, the agency reluctantly admitted that,
Iraqi interest in aluminum tubes appears to
have come from efforts to produce 81-mm rockets, rather than a nuclear
end use.
Needless to say, given the actual facts, the
narrative that the admittedly false claims that Iraq was reconstituting its
nuclear weapons program were the product of an intelligence failure cannot
withstand the slightest scrutiny.
This claim is completely fictional. Simply
stated, the fact of the matter is that the government lied, and no attempt
by individuals or agencies responsible for these lies seeking to obfuscate
and deny that fact could possibly be considered a mea culpa by any serious
and honest analyst.
The failure of journalists to objectively state
the obvious fact that government officials lied and the near universal
willingness to repeat the official fictional narrative of intelligence
failure following the invasion is a further reflection of the same
intellectual culture in the U.S. that was witnessed prior to the war, when
the mainstream media uncritically parroted the governments claims and
reported lies and deceptions as fact.
A Counterintelligence
Success
One may similarly examine virtually every other aspect of the case for war
and see the same repetition of official deception.
On February 24, 2001, Colin Powell stated that
Saddam Hussein,
has not developed any significant
capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction.
When he went before the Security Council two
years later to present the administrations case for war, he knew he was
lying.
He knew that the claims he was making were not
supported by the available evidence. He knew that his claims were
contradicted by the available intelligence assessments of the nations top
experts in their respective fields.
Another example of this was the claim that Iraqs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
were intended to deliver chemical and biological weapons.
On October 7, 2002, President Bush
declared,
Weve also discovered through intelligence
that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles
that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across
broad areas. Were concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these
UAVs for missions targeting the United States.
According to Senator Bill Nelson, prior
to the Congressional vote on the resolution granting the President the
authority to enforce U.N. resolutions through the Security Council -
(contrary to popular belief, the invasion of Iraq was a violation of the
U.S. Constitution as well as international law) - members of Congress were
told that Iraq could deliver anthrax to U.S. cities using UAVs.
He testified,
I was told that not only did he have the
weapons of mass destruction and that he had the means to deliver them
through unmanned aerial vehicles, but that he had the capability of
transporting those UAVs outside of Iraq and threatening the homeland
here in America, specifically by putting them on ships off the eastern
seaboard of which they would then drop their WMD on eastern seaboard
cities.
You can see all the more why I thought there
was an imminent threat.
In his February 5 presentation before the
Security Council, Colin Powell showed a picture of an Iraqi Mirage jet
aircraft that he claimed was spraying simulated anthrax.
He claimed that spray tanks capable of
dispersing chemical or biological weapons were,
intended to be mounted on a MiG-21 that had
been converted into an unmanned aerial vehicle, or a UAV. He added that
UAVs outfitted with spray tanks constitute an ideal method for
launching a terrorist attack using biological weapons.
After making these allegations, he turned his
attention to Iraqs actual known UAVs, which were smaller and lighter than a
jet aircraft.
These, he said,
are well suited for dispensing chemical and
biological weapons. There is ample evidence that Iraq has dedicated much
effort to developing and testing spray devices that could be adapted for
UAVs.
He argued that,
According to Iraqs December 7 declaration,
its UAVs have a range of only 80 kilometers. But we detected one of
Iraqs newest UAVs in a test flight that went 500 kilometers nonstop on
autopilot in a race track pattern - that is to say, it was flown
around and around and around in a circle.
For this argument, Powell was relying on the
ignorance of his audience.
He could not have been unaware that Iraqs UAVs
necessarily functioned by use of a guiding signal that had a limited range.
Thus, while the UAVs were shown to be able to carry enough fuel to fly a
distance of 500 km, Powell in fact offered no evidence to contradict Iraqs
declaration that its UAVs had a range of 80 km.
This was deliberate sleight-of-hand, a blatant
effort to deceive.
He further stated that,
Iraq could use these small UAVs which have
a wingspan of only a few meters to deliver biological agents to its
neighbors or if transported, to other countries, including the United
States.
The U.N. inspectors, however, had not arrived at
the same conclusions.
In his report to the Security Council on March
7, Hans Blix only briefly mentioned Iraqs UAVs, saying,
Inspectors are also engaged in examining
Iraqs program for Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs). A number of sites
have been inspected with data being collected to assess the range and
other capabilities of the various models found. Inspections are
continuing in this area.
In summing up the matter of Iraqs UAVs in the
book he later wrote on the inspections process, Blix wrote,
The U.S. administration had concluded -
almost certainly wrongly, it now appears - that the drone was a
violation of the Security Councils resolution. At UNMOVIC we were not
ready to make that assessment.
This angered Washington, despite the fact
that it must have been known that the U.S. Air Force itself did not
believe the Iraqi drones were for the delivery of biological and
chemical agents.
And, as Blix also noted, the Air Force was,
the greatest repository of U.S. expertise
on drones.
Turning to the actual intelligence underlying
the administrations claims, the Air Force experts had indeed assessed that
Iraqs drone aircraft were not designed or intended to disperse chemical or
biological weapons, but for surveillance.
The classified version of the October 2002 NIE
stated that Iraq was,
working with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
which allow for a more lethal means to deliver biological and, less
likely, chemical warfare agents.
The NIE judged that the UAVs were probably
intended to deliver biological warfare agents, and even went so far as to
declare that,
Baghdads UAVs could threaten Iraqs
neighbors, US forces in the Persian Gulf, and if brought to, or into,
the United States, the US Homeland.
However, the NIE also made known the dissent
from these judgments from the nations top experts on UAVs.
Air Force analysts agreed that although CBW
delivery is an inherent capability, they did not believe Iraqs UAVs were
intended for that purpose, but rather had a primary role of
reconnaissance.
The Air Force judged that,
Iraq is developing UAVs primarily for
reconnaissance rather than delivery platforms for CBW agents
CBW
delivery is an inherent capability of UAVs but probably is not the
impetus for Iraqs recent UAV programs.
The CIA relegated this judgment of the nations
top experts on UAVs to a footnote.
Even more revealing, the NIEs section on
biological warfare disclosed that we have no information linking the
current UAV development with BW delivery - and recall that their use to
deliver chemical weapons was even less likely.
Thus, the CIA admitted that no evidence actually
existed to support its own judgments that Iraqs drones were intended to
deliver CBW.
Furthermore, the Air Force was not alone in its dissent from the CIAs
baseless assessments. The UAV analyst from the INR later informed the Senate
Committee that he agreed with the Air Forces assessment, but that he
nevertheless declined to join in the Air Forces footnote.
DIA analysts also testified that they had also
agreed with the Air Forces judgments, but had similarly declined to make
this known in the NIE. Even analysts within the CIA agreed with the experts
from the Air Force.
One CIA UAV analyst admitted to the Committee
that,
some of Iraqs UAVs were in fact developed
for reconnaissance and as aerial targets.
Others revealed that,
they did not believe that CIAs assessments
about the UAVs were accurately represented because the NIE did not
address the reconnaissance mission.
The reason offered for this was that,
those roles fell outside the scope of the
Iraq WMD NIE.
In other words, information which did not
support the CIAs judgments was deliberately omitted - or, in the case of
the Air Forces dissent, relegated to a footnote.
In a subsequent NIE titled Nontraditional Threats to the US Homeland
Through 2007, published in January 2003, the Air Force, DIA, and Army all
agreed that,
BW delivery is an inherent capability of
most UAVs and that Iraq may choose to exploit this capability, but they
note that the evidence is unconfirmed and is not sufficiently compelling
to indicate the Iraqis done so. There is information, however, on
procurements that indicate a reconnaissance mission for the UAV program
is more likely.
The picture begins to emerge that what the CIA
described as dissent in the October NIE was in fact regarded by all of the
top American experts on UAVs as sound analysis.
Once again, it becomes clear that far from there
having been an intelligence failure, the governments claims simply were
not supported by the available intelligence.
In another illustration of this fact, the report of the Senate Committee
observed,
The only intelligence reporting that
demonstrated any possibility that Iraq may have intended to use the UAVs
to attack targets within the U.S. was reporting that Iraq was trying to
procure U.S. mapping software for its small UAVs. The NIE said the
procurement effort, strongly suggests that Iraq is investigating the
use of these UAVs for missions targeting the United States.
Subsequent assessments, however, acknowledged
that Iraq,
may have ordered the U.S. mapping software
unintentionally. Based on the new information, the DIA, the USAF, and
the Army all chose to include a footnote noting that they interpreted
recent reporting to mean that the purpose of the Iraqi request for
route planning software and topgraphic database was to acquire a generic
mapping capability - a goal that is not necessarily indicative of an
intent to target the U.S. Homeland.
Part of Powells claims regarding Iraqs UAVs
included the allegation that Iraq had weaponized anthrax that it could spray
from the drones.
The facts are clear that this claim, too, was
not the product of an intelligence failure.
Bush told the U.N. General Assembly on
September 12, 2002, that,
From 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it
had no biological weapons. After a senior official in its program
defected and exposed this lie, the regime admitted producing tens of
thousands of liters of anthrax and other deadly biological agents.
The official he was referring to, of course, was
Hussein Kamal, who had in fact testified that nothing remained of Iraqs
biological weapons, that they were destroyed in 1991 - a fact Bush could
not have been unaware of but deliberately omitted in order to deceive the
public.
On September 28, Bush stated,
The dangers we face only worsen from month
to month and year to year
and each passing day could be the one on
which the Iraq regime gives anthrax or VX nerve gas or someday a nuclear
weapon to a terrorist group.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said on
September 19, 2002, that Iraq had,
amassed large clandestine stockpiles of
biological weapons, including anthrax, botulism toxin, possibly
smallpox.
Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, Colin
Powell told his global audience in his presentation to the U.N., holding
up a small vial filled with white powder, about this amount - this is
just about the amount of a teaspoon - less than a teaspoon full of dry
anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of
2001
If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to
fill tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has
not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoon of this deadly material.
Powell claimed that Iraq,
had perfected drying techniques for their
biological weapons programs and had incorporated this drying
expertise into mobile production facilities.
That Iraq had destroyed WMD in 1991 was public
knowledge.
The British dossier in September 2002
acknowledged that,
Iraq destroyed unilaterally and illegally,
some biological weapons in 1991 and 1992 making accounting for these
weapons impossible.
The meaningless use of the adverb illegally
aside, the relevance of this statement was that it implicitly acknowledged
that there was no evidence that Iraq still possessed biological weapons.
It rather shifted the burden of proof so that no
such evidence was required; Iraq rather had to prove that it didnt have
such weapons.
The dossier explained the issue regarding
anthrax succinctly:
From a series of Iraqi declarations to the
UN during the 1990s we know that by 1991 they had produced at least
8,500 liters of anthrax, but the UN inspectors were unable to account
for
growth media procured for biological agent production (enough to
produce over three times the 8,500 litres of anthrax spores Iraq admits
to having manufactured).
In other words, the Iraqis admitted to having
produced 8,500 liters of anthrax before the Gulf War, but they could
possibly have produced more.
As Hans Blix similarly explained,
In most cases, the issues are outstanding
not because there is information that contradicts Iraqs account, but
simply because there is a lack of supporting evidence that it had
destroyed all its WMD.
That is to say, there was no evidence Iraq still
possessed biological weapons; U.N. inspectors just hadnt reached the point
where they could declare that they had verified that all of Iraqs WMD had
been destroyed, as Iraq claimed.
Blix explained further that,
Iraq has declared that it produced about
8,500 litres of anthrax, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in
the summer of 1991.
There was no convincing evidence for its
destruction, Blix said, but he added that Iraq has provided little
evidence for this production - that is to say, there was no evidence Iraq
had destroyed all of its anthrax, but neither was there any evidence it
still possessed any, and there was little evidence Iraq ever actually
produced that much in the first place.
As former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter explained, UNSCOM had,
fundamentally disarmed Iraq, with 90-95%
of Iraqs weapons of mass destruction capability
verifiably
eliminated.
Furthermore, Ritter explained, the anthrax that
Iraq had produced had a shelf life that would have rendered it useless many
years prior.
Iraq had produced only liquid bulk anthrax,
which even under ideal storage, germinates in three years, becoming
useless. Contrary to Powells claims, there was no evidence that Iraq had
ever successfully produced dried anthrax.
David Kay later admitted in testimony to
the U.S. Senate that Iraq had never dried anthrax, but only a simulant.
The CIA admitted in its final report that the,
ISG has found no information that Iraq had ever produced weaponizable
dried B. anthracis.
A senior scientist in Iraqs biological weapons program
during the 1980s, Dr. Nissar Hindawi, told the New York Times in
April 2003 that Iraq had produced huge quantities of liquid anthrax before
the Gulf War.
However,
There were orders to destroy it, he added.
He also confirmed that they had never been able
to make dried anthrax.
Powells deceptive comments served several propaganda purposes.
-
First, they served to obfuscate the fact
that the liquid anthrax Iraq actually produced would have already
degraded years before.
-
Second, they served to imply that Iraq
had weaponized powdered anthrax.
-
Third, they created a mental association
between the anthrax letters mailed in the U.S. shortly after the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which attacks were
constantly invoked by the Bush administration in drawing
associations between 9/11 and Iraq.
This psychological association between Iraq and
9/11 was such successful propaganda that, according to one poll, 70% of
Americans believed that Iraq was involved in the attacks.
Thus the country was suffering from a mass
delusion resulting from the governments deceptions, such as Dick Cheneys
lie that it had been pretty well confirmed that alleged hijacker Mohammed
Atta had met with Iraqi intelligence agents in Prague - the truth being that
U.S. intelligence had concluded this meeting had never occurred.
Indeed, the U.S. media had been full of baseless
reports accusing Iraq of being behind the anthrax mailings, a false
perception Powell was deliberately trying to exploit to manufacture consent
for war.
Scott Ritter responded to the allegations that Iraq was behind the anthrax
attacks in The Guardian:
Under the most stringent on-site inspection
regime in the history of arms control, Iraqs biological weapons
programs were dismantled, destroyed or rendered harmless during the
course of hundreds of no-notice inspections.
The major biological weapons production
facility - al Hakum, which was responsible for producing Iraqs anthrax
- was blown up by high explosive charges and all its equipment
destroyed
Thousands of swabs and samples were taken from buildings and
soil throughout Iraq.
No evidence of anthrax or any other
biological agent was discovered. While it was impossible to verify that
all of Iraqs biological capability had been destroyed, the UN never
once found evidence that Iraq had either retained biological weapons or
associated production equipment, or was continuing work in the field.
Ritter also pointed out that,
Iraq procured the Vollum strain of anthrax
from American Type Culture Collection - which is was provided by the
United States while it was supporting Saddam Hussein during the period
when he committed his worst atrocities, including the oft-repeated crime
of gassing his own people (a reference to his use of chemical weapons
against the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988).
The strain used in the post-9/11 anthrax
mailings, on the other hand, was the Ames strain - which had been produced
at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID)
at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
It was already well known at the time that Iraq had obtained its precursors
for chemical and biological weapons from the United States.
When Iraq engaged in chemical and
biological warfare in the 1980s, author William Blum observed in 1998,
barely a peep of moral outrage could be heard from Washington, as it
kept supplying Saddam with the materials he needed to build weapons.
A Senate report from 1994 stated that,
The United States provided the Government
of Iraq with dual use licensed materials which assisted in the
development of Iraqi chemical, biological, and missile-system programs,
including
chemical warfare agent precursors; chemical warfare agent
production facility plans and technical drawings (provided as pesticide
production facility plans); chemical warhead filling equipment;
biological warfare related materials; missile fabrication equipment;
and, missile-system guidance equipment
Records available from the supplier for the
period from 1985 until the present show that during this time,
pathogenic (meaning disease producing), toxigenic (meaning
poisonous), and other biological research materials were exported to
Iraq pursuant to application and licensing by the U.S. Department of
Commerce
These exported biological materials were not
attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction.
The CIAs final report, popularly known as
the Duelfer Report after Charles Duelfer, who replaced David Kay as the
head of the ISG, would later admit, after its failure to find WMD in Iraq,
that,
in 1991 and 1992, Iraq appears to have
destroyed its undeclared stocks of BW weapons and probably destroyed
remaining holdings of bulk BW agent.
Returning to Powells claims that Iraq had
mobile production facilities used to make biological agents, this
allegation came from a single source, code-named Curveball, whom the CIA
had never actually interviewed.
The CIA had rather relied on German reporting,
which had come complete with warnings that he was a drunk and that his
claims couldnt be corroborated.
On May 30, 2003, several months after the
invasion of Iraq, Bush declared that U.S. forces had,
found the weapons of mass destruction.
They had found biological laboratories, he
lied.
Remember when Colin Powell stood up in
front of the world, and said Iraq has got laboratories, mobile labs to
build biological weapons?
He answered his own question,
[W]eve so far discovered two, adding that
well find more weapons as time goes on.
He then made a vain attempt to belittle his
critics by saying,
But for those who say we havent found the
banned manufacturing devices or banned weapons, theyre wrong. We found
them.
Inconveniently for the administration, a British
team investigated the trailers and concluded that nothing of the sort had
been found.
One biological weapons expert told The Observer,
They are not mobile germ warfare
laboratories. You could not use them for making biological weapons. They
do not even look like them. They are exactly what the Iraqis said they
were - facilities for the production of hydrogen gas to fill balloons.
As it turned out, it was the U.K. that had sold
the system, known as an Artillery Meteorological System, or Amets, to Iraq
in 1987.
The nature of the U.S. case for war was aptly summarized in the minutes of a
meeting of senior ministers of the British government on July 23, 2002, the
infamous Downing Street Memo, which observed:
Military action was now seen as inevitable.
Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the
conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were
being fixed around the policy.
Conclusion
The narrative that there was an intelligence failure leading up to the
U.S. invasion of Iraq on March 19, 2003 cannot withstand the slightest
scrutiny.
The simple fact of the matter is that there was
no evidence that Iraq still possessed WMD. The fact of the matter is that
top experts in their respective fields within the U.S. intelligence
community had correctly assessed that Iraq did not have WMD or ongoing WMD
programs.
The CIAs judgments to the contrary were not the
result of a failure within the intelligence community to correctly analyze
and assess the evidence, but of a systematic effort to control information
in order to limit dissent and stovepipe products to administration
officials that would support the governments official policy of regime
change.
In other words, the policy was not based on the
intelligence, but the CIAs intelligence products were rather based on the
policy.
Understood in these terms, it becomes apparent that far from a failure,
the governments disinformation campaign designed to manufacture consent for
war was a resounding success.
The narrative of an intelligence failure
attempts to pin responsibility on analysts within the intelligence community
rather than on senior administration officials such as,
-
President George W.
Bush
-
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice
-
Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld
-
Secretary of State Colin Powell
It attempts to shift the blame for the lies of
senior policymakers onto analysts who supposedly didnt do their jobs
correctly.
But the truth of the matter is that analysts who
did do their job were sidelined and silenced, while assessments from
analysts like Joe who dishonestly touted the official line were stovepiped
to policymakers in intelligence products containing judgments completely
unsupported by the available evidence.
The narrative of intelligence failure attempts to obfuscate the truth of
the matter, which is that senior government officials repeatedly lied and
willfully deceived the public by making claims unsupported by evidence and
by deliberately withholding any information that contradicted their
allegations.
Seen in this light, it becomes evident that the
recently released CIA document is anything but a mea culpa.
It is, on the contrary, just more of the same.
