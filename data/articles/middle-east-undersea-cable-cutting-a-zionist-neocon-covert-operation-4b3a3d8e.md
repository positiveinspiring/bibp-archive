In the Middle East in the last three days, there
have been several undersea, international communications cables that have
been cut. On Wednesday, 30 January 2008, two major, undersea communications
cables were cut off the Egyptian coast, in the eastern Mediterranean. (1)
The story has received prominent play in the international news cycle.
Various explanations have been floated in the mainstream news media as to
the cause - the most popular culprit being a "ship anchor". In any event,
communications in the region have been severely disrupted, all the way from
Egypt to India, and most points in between.
Then on Friday, 1 February 2008, an undersea cable in the Persian Gulf,
running between Oman and Dubai, was also cut "causing severe phone line
disruptions and compounding an already existing Internet outage across large
parts of the Middle East and Asia" according to the International Herald
Tribune. (2)
There was also a report on Friday, 1 February 2008, of yet another undersea,
fiber optic communications cable between Suez and Sri Lanka that has been
cut. The reporting is a bit confused; however, given that the Persian Gulf
is geographically distant from the Suez, this appears to represent a fourth
undersea cable that has been cut. (3)
So let's see if we can figure this story out.
I will say up front that I am
well and thoroughly skeptical of the "ship anchor" explanation that has been
so prominently advanced in the mainstream news media. Yes, ships do
sometimes drag their anchors and dragging anchors can cause damage, true
enough. But to have three undersea cables - or is it actually four cables?
- cut in the same region in just a two day span, strains credulity; the
more so, when we look at how the damage has played out across the region.
Two countries in particular stand at conspicuously opposite ends of the
continuum of communications disruption.
-
The website,
internettrafficreport.com/asia.htm, reports that as of
Friday, 1 February 2008, internet traffic routing through/from/to Iran has
been cut to zero. Packet loss is 100%. (4)
-
Whereas CNN reported on Thursday, 31 January 2008, that internet traffic
to Israel has been unaffected because Israel uses a "different route". The
same CNN article also reports that Lebanon and Iraq have been "spared the
chaos". (5)
So, the sudden, unprecedented round of undersea, communications cable
cutting in the Middle East leaves Israel and Iraq still connected, while
completely shutting down the Iranian internet.
Funny how that works, isn't it?
As it happens, the two actors in the international arena in recent years
whose rhetoric has expressed the most animus for Iran are the United States
and Israel. They have also been by far the most bellicose, Zionist-NeoCon
propaganda notwithstanding.
Israel and the United States have repeatedly
committed military aggression against other countries in the region, and
have made many thinly veiled threats of war against Iran. In this decade,
the United States has militarily invaded and occupied first Afghanistan,
then Iraq, where its forces remain, bogged down in bloody wars of attrition. In the same period, Israel has bombed Syria, bombed and invaded Lebanon, and
placed the Palestinian territories under a merciless
blockade/occupation/assault.
Parallel with these international war crimes,
the United States and Israel have repeatedly rattled their sabres against
Iran.
Which brings the discussion back around to the instant spate of undersea,
communications cable cutting in the region that has uniquely brought Iranian
internet communications to a complete halt, while sparing Israel, which has
a different internet route than any of the cut cables, and Iraq, where the
American military occupation is bogged down.
As it happens, the U.S. Navy has for decades had special operations teams
that go out on submarines and deploy undersea, on the seabed itself,
specifically for cutting or tapping communications cables. The U.S. Navy
divers go out through special airlocks and use very sophisticated equipment.
This has all been thoroughly documented in the excellent book,
Blind Man's
Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage, by Sherry Sontag
and Christopher Drew (New York: Public Affairs, 1998).
For the uninitiated it seems bizarre and unlikely, but the plain fact of the
matter is that American military divers really go out onto the seabed from
special submarines outfitted with airlocks and they actually cut undersea
communications cables-- then patch in sophisticated surveillance equipment
-- then they splice the cables back together.
That is if the motive is
espionage. If the purpose of the operation is garden variety sabotage, then
simply cutting the cable suffices. It's like something out of a spy novel
thriller, but the U.S. Navy really does have submarines and deep diving,
special operations personnel who specialize in precisely this sort of
operation.
So cutting a few undersea cables in two or three days is well
within the operational capabilities of the United States Navy.
Couple this little known, but very important fact, with the reality that for
years now we have seen more and more ham-handed interference with the global
communications grid by the American alphabet soup (NSA, CIA, FBI, HoSec) and
major tel-comms. Would the tel-comms and the American military and alphabet
soup agencies collude on an operation that had as its aim to sabotage the
Iranian communications network, even if that entailed collateral damage to
other countries in the region?
The honest answer has to be: sure, maybe so.
Who can really tell? I mean, after all, we are living in a bizarre world
now, a world of big and bigger lies, a world of 24/7 propaganda, a world of
irrational and violent policies enacted against the civilian population by
multinational corporations and military and espionage agencies the world
over.
We see the evidence for this on every hand. Only the most myopic among
us remain oblivious to these realities.
In light of the American Navy's demonstrated sea-floor capabilities and
espionage activities, the heavy American Navy presence in the region, and
the many veiled threats against Iran by both the Americans and the Israelis,
suspicion naturally falls on them both. It may be that this is what the
beginning of a war against Iran looks like. Or maybe we are merely seeing a
dry run, a practice run, for a planned, upcoming war against Iran. The
cables that have been cut are among the largest communication pipes in the
region, and clearly represent major strategic targets.
Whatever the case, it is crystal clear that we are not looking at business
as usual. On the contrary, we are looking at distinctly unusual business,
that much is obvious.
The explanations being put forth in the mainstream news media for these
several cut, undersea communications cables absolutely do not pass the smell
test. And by the way, the same operators who cut undersea cables in the
Persian Gulf, Mediterranean Sea and possibly the Suez as well, presumably
can also cut underwater cables in the Gulf of Mexico or Great Lakes or ...
you see my point. This could be a multipurpose operation, in part a test run
for isolating a country from the international communications grid.
Iran
today, the USA tomorrow?
What's that you say? I don't understand how the world works? That kind of
thing can't happen here?
In any event, if the cables have been intentionally cut, then that is an
aggressive act of war. I'm sure the Iranians have gotten that message, and
are actively making counter preparations against a possible imminent attack.
I'm looking at the same telegram as they are, and I know I would be, were I
in their shoes.

Connecting The
Many Undersea Cut Cable Dots - 9 Or More?
by Richard Sauder, PhD
February-5-2008
from
Rense Website
The last week has seen a spate of unexplained,
cut, undersea communications cables that has severely disrupted
communications in many countries in the Middle East, North Africa and South
Asia. As I shall show, the total numbers of cut cables remain in question,
but likely number as many as eight, and maybe nine or more.
The trouble began on 30 January 2008 with CNN reports that two cables were
cut off the Egyptian Mediterranean coast, initially severely disrupting
Internet and telephone traffic from Egypt to India and many points in
between.
According to CNN the two cut cables,
"account for as much as
three-quarters of the international communications between Europe and the
Middle East."
CNN reported that the two cut cables off the
Egyptian coast were,
"FLAG Telecom's FLAG Europe-Asia cable and SeaMeWe-4, a
cable owned by a consortium of more than a dozen telecommunications
companies".(10)
Other reports placed one of the cut cables,
SeaMeWe-4, off the coast of France, near Marseille.(9)(12) However, many
news organizations reported two cables cut off the Egyptian coast, including
the SeaMeWe-4 cable connecting Europe with the Middle East.
The possibilities are thus three, based on the
reporting in the news media:
-
the SeaMeWe-4 cable was cut off the
coast of France, and mistakenly reported as being cut off the coast
of Egypt, because it runs from France to Egypt
-
the SeaMeWe-4 cable was cut off the
Egyptian coast and mistakenly reported as being cut off the coast of
France, because it runs from France to Egypt
-
the SeaMeWe-4 cable was cut both off the
Egyptian and the French coasts, nearly simultaneously, leading to
confusion in the reporting
I am not sure what to think, because most
reports, such as this one from the International Herald Tribune, refer to
two cut cables off the Egyptian coast, one of the two being the SeaMeWe4
cable,(11) while other reports also refer to a cut cable off the coast of
France.(9)(12)
It thus appears that the same cable may have
suffered two cuts, both off the French and the Egyptian coasts. So there
were likely actually three undersea cables cut in the Mediterranean on 30
January 2008.
In the case of the cables cut off the Egyptian coast, the news media
initially advanced the explanation that the cables had been cut by ships'
anchors.(10)(13)
But on 3 February the Egyptian Ministry of Communications
and Information Technology said that a review of video footage of the
coastal waters where the two cables passed revealed that the area had been
devoid of ship traffic for the 12 hours preceding and the 12 hours following
the time of the cable cuts.(5)(11) So the cable cuts cannot have been caused
by ship anchors, in view of the fact that there were no ships there.
The cable cutting was just getting started.
Two days later an undersea cable
was reported cut in the Persian Gulf, 55 kilometers off of Dubai.(11) The
cable off of Dubai was reported by CNN to be a FLAG Falcon cable.(10) And
then on 3 February came reports of yet another damaged undersea cable, this
time between Qatar and the UAE (United Arab Emirates).(6)(7)(11)
The confusion was compounded by another report on 1 February 2008 of a cut
undersea cable running through the Suez to Sri Lanka.(19) If the report is
accurate this would represent a sixth cut cable. The same article mentions
the cut cable off of Dubai in the Persian Gulf, but seeing as the Suez is on
the other side of the Arabian peninsula from the Persian Gulf, the article
logically appears to be describing two separate cable cutting incidents.
These reports were followed on 4 February 2008 with a report of even more
cut undersea cables. The Khaleej Times reported a total of five damaged
undersea cables: two off of Egypt and the cable near Dubai, all of which
have already been mentioned in this report.
But then the Khaleej Times mentions two that
have not been mentioned elsewhere, to my knowledge:
-
a cable in the Persian Gulf near Bandar
Abbas, Iran
-
the SeaMeWe4 undersea cable near Penang,
Malaysia (3)
The one near Penang, Malaysia appears to
represent a new incident. The one near Bandar Abbas is reported separately
from the one off Dubai and is evidently not the same incident, since the
report says , "FLAG near the Dubai coast" and "FALCON near Bandar Abbas in
Iran" were both cut. Bandar Abbas is on the other side of the Persian Gulf
from Qatar and the UAE, and so presumably the cut cable near Bandar Abbas is
not the one in that incident either.
Interestingly, the report also states that,
"The
first cut in the undersea Internet cable occurred on January 23," in the Flag Telcoms FALCON submarine cable which was not reported.(3)
This news article
deals primarily with the outage in the UAE, so it raises the question as to
whether this is a reference to yet a ninth cut cable that has not hit the
mainstream news cycle in the United States.
By my count, we are probably dealing with as many as eight, maybe even nine,
unexplained cut or damaged undersea cables within the last week, and not the
mere three or four that most mainstream news media outlets in the United
States are presently reporting. Given all this cable-cutting mayhem in the
last several days, who knows but what there may possibly be other cut and/or
damaged cables that have not made it into the news cycle, because they are
lost in the general cable-cutting noise by this point.
Nevertheless, let me
enumerate what I can, and keep in mind, I am not pulling these out of a hat;
all of the sources are referenced at the conclusion of the article; you can
click through and look at all the evidence that I have.
It's there if you care to read through it all.
-
one off of Marseille, France
-
two off of Alexandria, Egypt
-
one off of Dubai, in the Persian Gulf
-
one off of Bandar Abbas, Iran in the
Persian Gulf
-
one between Qatar and the UAE, in the
Persian Gulf
-
one in the Suez, Egypt
-
one near Penang, Malaysia
-
initially unreported cable cut on 23
January 2008 (Persian Gulf?)
Three things stand out about these incidents:
-
all of them, save one, have occurred in
waters near predominantly Muslim nations, causing disruption in
those countries
-
all but two of the cut/damaged cables
are in Middle Eastern waters
-
so many like incidents in such a short
period of time suggests that they are not accidents, but are in fact
deliberate acts, i.e., sabotage
The evidence therefore suggests that we are
looking at a coordinated program of undersea cable sabotage by an actor, or
actors, on the international stage with an anti-Muslim bias, as well as a
proclivity for destructive violence in the Middle Eastern region.
The question then becomes: are there any actors on the international stage
who exhibit a strong, anti-Muslim bias in their foreign relations, who have
the technical capability to carry out clandestine sabotage operations on the
sea floor, and who have exhibited a pattern of violently destructive
policies towards Muslim peoples and nations, especially in the Middle East
region?
The answer is yes, there are two: Israel and the United States of
America.
In recent years, Israel has bombed and invaded Lebanon, bombed Syria, and
placed the Palestinian Territories under a pitiless and ruthless
blockade/occupation/quarantine/assault. During the same time frame the
United States of America has militarily invaded and occupied Iraq and
Afghanistan, and American forces remain in both countries at present,
continuing to carry out aggressive military operations.
Simultaneous with these Israeli and American war
crimes against countries in the region, both Israel and the United States
have made many thinly veiled threats of war against Iran, and the United
States openly seeks to increase its military presence in Pakistan's
so-called "tribal areas".(15)
Israel and the United States both have a
technically sophisticated military operations capability. Moreover, the
United States Navy has a documented history of carrying out espionage
activities on the sea floor. The U.S. Navy has long had special operations
teams that can go out on submarines and deploy undersea, on the seabed
itself, specifically for this sort of operation.
This has all been thoroughly documented in the
excellent book,
Blind Man's
Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage, by
Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew (1998).
The classic example is
Operation Ivy Bells, which took place during the Cold War, in the waters
off the Soviet Union. In a joint, U.S. Navy-NSA operation, U.S. Navy divers
repeatedly tapped an underwater cable in the Kuril Islands, by swimming out
undersea, to and from U.S. Navy submarines.(14)
This sort of activity is like something straight out of a spy novel
thriller, but the U.S. Navy really does have special submarines and deep
diving, special operations personnel who specialize in precisely this sort
of operation. So cutting undersea cables is well within the operational
capabilities of the United States Navy.
Couple this little known, but very important fact, with the reality that for
years now we have seen more and more ham-handed interference with the global
communications grid by the American alphabet soup agencies (NSA, CIA,
FBI, HoSec) and major telecommunication companies.
-
Would the telecommunication companies
and the American military and alphabet soup agencies collude on an
operation that had as its aim to sabotage the communications network
across a wide region of the planet?
-
Would they perhaps collude with Israeli
military and intelligence agencies to do this?
The honest answer has to be: sure, maybe so.
The
hard reality is that we are now living in a world of irrational and violent
policies enacted against the civilian population by multinational
corporations, and military and espionage agencies the world over. We see the
evidence for this on every hand. Only the most myopic among us remain
oblivious to that reality.
In light of the American Navy's demonstrated sea-floor capabilities and
espionage activities, the heavy American Navy presence in the region, the
many, thinly veiled threats against Iran by both the Americans and the
Israelis, and their repeated, illegal, military aggression against other
nations in the region, suspicion quite naturally falls on both Israel and
the United States of America.
It may be that this is what the beginning of a
war against Iran looks like, or perhaps it is part of a more general, larger
assault against Muslim and/or Arab interests across a very wide region.
Whatever the case, this is no small operation, seeing as the cables that
have been cut are among the largest communication pipes in the region, and
clearly represent major strategic targets.
Very clearly, we are not looking at business as usual. On the contrary, it
is obvious that we are looking at distinctly unusual business.
The explanations being put forth in the mainstream news media for these many
cut, undersea communications cables absolutely do not pass the smell test.
And by the way, the same operators who cut undersea cables in the Persian
Gulf, Mediterranean Sea, Malaysia and possibly the Suez as well, presumably
can also cut underwater cables in the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, the
Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound. This could be a multipurpose operation, in
part a test run for isolating a country or region from the international
communications grid.
The Middle East today, the USA tomorrow?
What's that you say? I don't understand how the world works? That kind of
thing can't happen here?
In any event, if the cables have been intentionally cut, then that is an
aggressive act of war. I'm sure everyone in the region has gotten that
message. I'm looking at the same telegram as they are, and I know that it's
clear as a "bell" to me.(14)
It is little known by the American people, but nevertheless true, that Iran
intends to open its own Oil Bourse this month (February 2008) that will
trade in "non-dollar currencies".(16) This has massive
geo-political-economic implications for the United States and the American
economy, since the American dollar is at present still (if not for much
longer) the dominant reserve currency internationally, particularly for
petroleum transactions.
However, due to the mind-boggling scale of the
structural weaknesses in the American economy, which have been well
discussed in the financial press in recent weeks and months, the American
dollar is increasingly shunned by corporate, banking and governmental actors
the world over. No one wants to be stuck with vaults full of rapidly
depreciating dollars as the American economy hurtles towards the basement.
And so an operational Iranian Oil Bourse,
actively trading supertankers full of petroleum in non-dollar currencies,
poses a great threat to the American dollar's continued dominance as the
international reserve currency.
The American fear and unease of this development can only be increased by
the knowledge that,
"Oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
member states Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have set
2010 as the target date for adopting a monetary union and single
currency."(2)
The American government's fear must have
ratcheted up another notch when Kuwait "dropped its dollar peg" in May "and
adopted a basket of currencies", arousing "speculation that the UAE and
Qatar would follow suit or revalue their currencies."(2)
Although all the GCC members, with the exception
of Kuwait, agreed at their annual meeting in December 2007 to continue to
peg their currencies to the American dollar,(2) the hand writing is surely
on the wall. As the dollar plummets, their American currency holdings will
be worth less and less. At some point, they will likely decide to cut their
losses and decouple the value of their currencies from that of the dollar.
That point may be in 2010, when they establish
the new GCC currency, maybe even sooner than that. If Iran succeeds in
opening its own Oil Bourse it is hard to imagine that the GCC would not
trade on the Iranian Oil Bourse, given the extremely close geographic
proximity. And it is hard to believe that they would not trade their own oil
in their own currency. Otherwise, why have a currency of their own? Clearly
they intend to use it.
And just as clearly, the three cut or damaged
undersea communications cables in the Persian Gulf over the last week
deliver a clear message. The United States may be a senescent dinosaur, and
it is, but it is also a violent, heavily armed, very angry senescent
dinosaur. In the end, it will do what all aged dinosaurs do: perish. But not
before it first does a great deal of wild roaring and violent lashing and
thrashing about.
There can be no doubt that Iran, and the other Gulf States, were intended
recipients of this rather pointed cable cutting telegram, for all of the
reasons mentioned here; and additionally, in the case of Iran, probably also
as a waning for its perceived insults of Israel and dogged pursuit of its
nuclear program in contravention of NeoCon-Zionist dogma that Iran may not
have a nuclear program, though other nations in the region, Pakistan and
Israel, do.
I must mention that one of my e-mail correspondents has pointed out that
another possibility is that once the cables are cut, special operations
divers could hypothetically come in and attach surveillance devices to the
cables without being detected, because the cables are inoperable until they
are repaired and start functioning again.
In this way, other interests who wanted to spy
on Middle Eastern communications, let's say on banking and trading data
going to and from the Iranian Oil Bourse, or other nations in the Middle
East, could tap into the communications network under cover of an
unexplained cable "break".
Who knows? - this idea may have merit.
It is noteworthy that two of the cables that were cut lie off the Egyptian
Mediterranean coast, and another passes through the Suez. During the height
of the disruption, some 70 percent of the Egyptian Internet was down. (13)
This is a heavy blow in a day when everything from airlines, to banks, to
universities, to newspapers, to hospitals, to telephone and shipping
companies, and much more, uses the Internet.
So Egypt was hit very hard. An astute observer
who carefully reads the international press could not fail to notice that in
recent days there has been a report in the Egyptian press that "Egypt
rejected an Israeli-American proposal to resettle 800,000 Palestinians in
Sinai."
This has evidently greatly upset the Zionist-NeoCon power block
holding sway in Tel Aviv and Washington, DC with the result that Israel has
reportedly threatened to have American aid to Egypt reduced if Egypt does
not consent to the resettlement of the Palestinians in Egyptian
territory.(17)
This NeoCon-Zionist tantrum comes hard on the
heels of the Israeli desire to cut ties with Gaza, as a consequence of the
massive breach of the Gaza-Egypt border by hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians in January 2008. (18)
What are NeoCon-Zionist tyrants to do when their diplomatic hissy fits and
anti-Arab tirades no longer carry the day in Cairo? Or in Qatar and the UAE?
Maybe they get out the underwater cable cutters and deploy some special
operations submarines and divers in the waters off of Alexandria and in the
Suez and in the Persian Gulf.
This would be completely in line with articulated American military
doctrine, which frankly views the Internet as something to be fought.
American Freedom Of Information researchers at George Washington University
obtained a Department of Defense (Pentagon) document in 2006, entitled
"Information Operation Roadmap", which says forthrightly and explicitly that
"the Department must be prepared to 'fight the net'".(20)
This is a direct quote. It goes on to say that,
"We Must Improve Network and
Electro-Magnetic Attack Capability. To prevail in an information-centric
fight, it is increasingly important that our forces dominate the
electromagnetic spectrum with attack capabilities." (20)
It also makes reference to the importance of
employing a "robust offensive suite of capabilities to include full-range
electronic and computer network attack."(8)(20)
So now we can add to our list of data points the professed intent of the
American military to "fight the net", using a "robust offensive suite of
capabilities" in a " full-range electronic and computer network attack."
Maybe this sudden spate of cut communications cables is what it looks like
when the American military uses a "robust offensive suite of capabilities"
and mounts an "electronic and computer network attack" in order to "fight
the net" in one region of the world. They have the means, and the
opportunity, I've amply demonstrated that in this article. And now we also
have the motive, in their own words, from their own policy statement.
The plain translation is that the American
military now regards the Internet, that means the hardware such as
computers, cables, modems, servers and routers, and presumably also the
content it contains, and the people who communicate that content, as an
adversary, as something to be fought.
Oh yes, just a couple of more dots to connect before you fall asleep
tonight:
-
The USS San Jacinto, an anti-missile AEGIS
cruiser, was scheduled to dock in Haifa, Israel on 1 February 2008. The
Jerusalem Post reported that this ship's anti-missile system "could be
deployed in the region in the event of an Iranian missile attack against
Israel."(1) Are we to expect another "false flag" attack, like the
inside job on 9-11 perhaps? -- an attack that will be made to appear
that it comes from Iran, and that is then used as a pretext to strike
Iran, maybe with nuclear weapons? And when Iran retaliates with its own
missiles, then the Americans and Israelis will unleash further hell on
Iran? Is that the Zionist-NeoCon plan, or something generally along
those lines?
-
I have to wonder because just this past
Saturday, there was a report in the news that, "Retired senior officers
told Israelis ... to prepare 'rocket rooms' as protection against a rain
of missiles expected to be fired at the Jewish State in any future
conflict." Retired General Udi Shani reportedly said, "The next war will
see a massive use of ballistic weapons against the whole of Israeli
territory."(4)
Now that we know the Israeli military
establishment's thinking, and now that we have a view into the American
military mindset, we ought to be looking at international events across the
board with a very critical, analytical eye, especially as they relate to
possible events that either are playing out right now, or may potentially
play out in the relatively near future, say in the time frame of the next
one month to five years.
These people are violent and devious; they have
forewarned us, and we should take them at their word, given their murderous
record on the international stage.
