Summary:
"Petraeus-gate,"
some U.S. pundits are calling it.
How significant is it
that even the head of the CIA can have his emails read
by an albeit friendly domestic intelligence agency,
which can lead to his resignation and global, and very
public humiliation?
Here's how.
The U.S. government - and likely your own government, for that matter - is
either watching your online activity every minute of the day through
automated methods and non-human eavesdropping techniques, or has the ability
to dip in as and when it deems necessary - sometimes with a warrant,
sometimes without.
That tin-foil hat really isn't going to help.
Take it off, you look silly.
Gen. David Petraeus, the former head of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency, resigned over the weekend after he was found to
have engaged in an extra-marital affair. What caught Petraeus out was, of
all things, his usage
of Google's online email service, Gmail.
This has not only landed the former CIA chief in
hot water but has ignited the debate over how, when, and why governments and
law enforcement agencies are able to access ordinary citizens' email
accounts, even if they are the head of the most powerful intelligence agency
in the world.
If it makes you feel any better, the chances
are small that your own or a foreign government will snoop on you. The odds
are much greater - at least for the ordinary person (terrorists, hijackers et
al: take note) - that your email account will be broken into by a
stranger exploiting your weak password, or an ex-lover with a grudge (see "Fatal
Attraction").
Forget
ECHELON, or signals intelligence, or the
interception of communications by black boxes installed covertly in data
centers.
Intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies can access -
thanks to the shift towards Web-based email services in the cloud - but it's
not as exciting or as Jack Bauer-esque as one may think or hope for.
The easiest way to access almost anybody's email
nowadays is still through the courts. (Sorry to burst your bubble, but it's
true.)
The 'save as draft'
trick
Petraeus set up a private account under a
pseudonym and composed email messages but never sent them. Instead,
they were saved in draft.
His lover, Paula Broadwell, would log in under
the same account, read the email and reply, all without sending anything.
The traffic would not be sent across the
networks through Google's data centers, making it nigh on impossible for the
National Security Agency or any other electronic signals eavesdropping
agency (such as Britain's elusive
GCHQ) to 'read' the traffic while it is in
transit.
Saving an email as a draft almost entirely
eliminates network traffic,
making it nigh on impossible for
intelligence agencies to 'traffic sniff.'
And yes, terrorists and pedophiles have been
known to use this 'trick', but also sophisticated criminals also use this
technique. It eliminates a network trail to a greater or lesser extent, and
makes it more difficult to trace.
But surely IP addresses are logged and noted?
When emails are sent and received, yes. But the emails were saved in draft
and therefore were not sent. However,
Google may still have a record of the
IP addresses of those who logged into the account.
However, most Internet or broadband providers
offer dynamic IP addresses that change over time, and an IP address does not
always point to the same computer, let alone the same region or state every
time it is assigned to a user.
Even then, recent U.S. court cases have
found that IP addresses do not specifically point to a computer, meaning
even if the authorities were sure that it was Petraeus, for instance -
though IP addresses very rarely give the exact house number and street
address - it would not stick in court.
As is often the case, human error can land
someone in the legal spotlight. 37-year-old Florida resident Jill Kelley, a
family friend to the Petraeus', allegedly received emails from an anonymous
account warning Kelley to stay away from the CIA chief.
But when Broadwell sent these messages, it left
behind little fragments of data attached to the email - every email you send
has this data attached - which first led the FBI on a path that led up to
the very door of Petraeus' office door in Langley, Virginia.
Get a warrant, serve it
to Google?
There's no such thing as a truly 'anonymous'
email account, and no matter how much you try to encrypt the contents of the
email you are sending, little fragments of data are attached by email
servers and messaging companies.
It's how email works and it's entirely
unavoidable.
Every
email sent and received comes with 'communications data,' otherwise
known as "metadata" - little fragments of information that carries the
recipient and the sender's address, and routing data such as the IP
addresses of the sender and the servers or data center that it's passed
through.
Extracting this metadata is not a mystery or
difficult, in fact anyone can do it, but if you have the legal tools and law
enforcement power to determine where the email was passed through - such as
an IP address of one of Google's data center in the United States.
Email is surprisingly similar to the postal
system,
especially when it comes
to the communication "metadata."
The system is remarkably similar to the postal
system.
You can seal the envelope and hide what's inside, but it contains a
postmark of where it came from and where it's going. It may even have your
fingerprints on it. All of this information outside the contents is
"metadata."
That said, even if you use a disposable Gmail
account - such as iamananonymousemailsender@gmail.com,
for instance - it's clearly a Gmail account, and Gmail is operated by
Google.
Sometimes it just takes a smidgen of common knowledge.
Ultimately, only Google had access to the
emails. Because it's a private company, it does not
fall under the scope of the Fourth Amendment. If the U.S. government or
one of its law enforcement agencies wanted to access the private Petraeus
email account, it would have to serve up a warrant.
In this case, however, the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) would not apply.
Even the Patriot Act would not
necessarily apply in this case, even though it does allow the FBI and other
authorized agencies to search email. However, in this case, above all else,
the Stored Communications Act (SCA) does apply -
part
of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
The act allows for any electronic data to be
read if it has been stored for less than 180 days.
In this case, the law was
specifically designed - albeit quite some time before email became a
mainstream communications medium - to allow server- or computer-stored data
to be accessed by law enforcement.
However, a court order must be issued before the
180 day limit, and in this case it was.
Reporting from London, the BBC News'
Mark Ward summed it
up in a single sentence:
Once it knew Ms. Broadwell was the sender of
the threatening messages, the FBI got a warrant that gave it covert
access to the anonymous email account.
And that's how they do it.
No matter which way
you look at it, no matter how much the government or its law enforcement
agencies want the data or the proof of wrongdoing, they must almost always
get a court order.
And Petraeus is no different from any other U.S.
citizen, U.K. citizen, or European citizen - and further afield for that
matter. What it always boils down to is a court order, and it's as simple as
that. It's not ECHELON or an
episode of "24" using hacking or
cracking techniques; it's an afternoon in a fusty courtroom with a
semi-switched on (and preferably sober) judge.
That said, it doesn't grant unfettered or
unrestricted access to a user's inbox or email account, but when an alleged
crime has been committed or law enforcement starts digging around, it allows
a fairly wide berth of powers to request access to electronically stored
data.
Former assistant secretary to the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security Stewart Baker
told the Associated Press:
The government can't just wander through
your emails just because they'd like to know what you're thinking or
doing. But if the government is investigating a crime, it has a lot of
authority to review peoples emails.
So there it is.
A court order is all you need to
access a person's inbox, but sufficient evidence is often required in order
to do this - particularly through the Stored Communications Act, or the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
It sounds obvious, of course, that's because it
is.
That said, if there is reasonable suspicion
albeit lacking evidence, or a U.S. law enforcement agency is dealing with a
foreign national outside of the United States, that normally requires a
secret FISA court order to be granted in order to proceed with the
interception of data or warranted access to an email account, for example.
Outside the U.S. - Is it
still 'just' a court order?
A simple court order is all it takes and it can
apply to anyone in public office or the man on the street holding a sign
warning that "the end is nigh."
But it's OK; you're in Europe, or Australia, or
Asia.
The U.S. can't use their laws against you in a foreign country
because, well, you're outside of its jurisdiction. Again, sorry to burst
your privacy bubble but that excuse
didn't wash with the European Parliament, it shouldn't with you either.
If you're a European citizen with a Microsoft,
Google, Yahoo or Apple account - or any
email offered in the cloud by a U.S. company - which is most consumer
email services nowadays - it is accessible to the U.S. courts and other
nations through various acts of law, such as the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA) or the PATRIOT Act, in which the latter amended much
of what the former had implemented in the first place.
("Oh great,
he's talking about the Patriot Act again," says everybody.)
It's worth noting a common few misconceptions.
Since first reporting this some years ago (and subsequently
sparking a trans-Atlantic diplomatic row, whoops) analysts and experts
alike, some who are under the thumb of the cloud companies themselves, claim
that the Patriot Act - to use the umbrella, common term - does not allow the
U.S. government or its law enforcement agencies the powers that others (*cough*
including me) claim.
Let's just run through a few examples of false
claims on top of false claims:
It doesn't give "unrestricted" or
"unprecedented" access to date outside the U.S., because for the most part
these warrants must go through a special FISA court.
The trouble is even
though there is some level of accountability via the FISA courts, these
sessions are held in secret and there are no public minutes or record to go
from, so swings and roundabouts.
Only in exceptional cases where warrants are not
issued is when there is an immediate threat to life. But because these
courts are secret, there's no definitive and ultimate way to know for an
absolute fact that the U.S. authorities don't just bypass the FISA courts
and skip ahead with their investigations anyway.
(You only really have my word - and my sources
in the U.S. government, such as legal counsels and spokespeople, to go on.)
Pretty much every country around the world
has 'Patriot Act'-like legislation.
It's just where to look for it.
On the third point, other countries do have
similar laws and this should be noted. (I personally thought it was
relatively common knowledge, forgive my naivety.)
The U.K., for instance,
has
the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act that can be used to acquire data
from a third-country via a U.K.-based firm, just as the Patriot Act can
be used on a U.S. firm to access data in a third-country via a local
subsidiary.
But in terms of where the major email and cloud
providers are based - the United States, notably on the West Coast - it
means that U.S. law must apply, in spite of foreign laws that attempt to or
successfully counteract the provisions offered in U.S. law.
Not many major
cloud providers operate solely in the U.K., whereas
Microsoft,
Google, Apple
and Amazon are all U.S. headquartered with a subsidiary in the U.K. and
other countries.
The lesson here?
We're all as bad as each other
and no legally or financially reasonable place is safe to store data if
you're a massive criminal or looking to stash a bunch of secret or uncouth
documents away from the authorities.
As for Petraeus, he may have been careful but in
spite of his counter-terrorism knowledge and clever tricks in going under
the radar,
ultimately there was a weak link in the security chain - and no matter
how far you go to try and cover your tracks, often it always falls down to
two things: human error, or sex.
Five Ways to Avoid Pulling a "Petraeus"
- Security for Your Email -

When it comes to keeping your e-mail private,
it's not hard to be smarter than the former
director of the CIA.
Here are five easy tips for avoiding David
Petraeus' missteps.
The 'extramarital affair' scandal engulfing
former CIA director David Petraeus have brought massive public
attention to the convoluted U.S. laws governing e-mail privacy. We've got
some quick tips for keeping your electronic communiqués private.
Before getting into the more technical side of
things, there are some simple behavioral changes you can make:
-
Always log out
of your e-mail when you're done using it. This goes for any online
service, including social networking sites. Logging out prevents a
cached password from keeping you signed in even after the browser
has been restarted.
-
Never use your preferred
personal e-mail account for highly
sensitive communication. Set up new e-mail account that's not
connected to you in any way, and is only used for communicating with
that one person. It's a good idea to keep sensitive information out
of your subject line, too.
-
Change your location
so that your IP address changes. Pick up your butt and head across
town to a restaurant or cafe with Wi-Fi that's not in your usual
haunts list, some place that's not near your home, office, or hotel.
Access your alternative e-mail account only from a one of these
alternative locations, and do not under any circumstances log on to
any of your "regular" accounts from that alternative location. Those
easily could be used to track your movements and connect you
"secret" account to your main ones.
-
Masking your IP address
sounds technical, but it can be as simple as installing a program.
E-mail is less like a sealed letter, and more like a postcard - with
the proper know-how, it's not all that hard to flip it over and read
it. The most direct way to do it is to use a reputable service like
TOR (download
for Windows |
Mac) or HotSpot Shield (download
for Windows |
Mac).
-
Using PGP encryption
remains the most effective way to make the inherently insecure
e-mail a safer way to communicate. PGP is not particularly easy,
however, and works best with a desktop e-mail client like Outlook or
Thunderbird - both of which are falling out of use as webmail
continues to dominate. There is no major webmail service that
supports
PGP encryption, although there are
services like
CounterMail (which I haven't used
yet) that do.
The best way to avoid the pitfalls of Petraeus
is to simply think about what you're doing, of course, and
maybe to knock off cheating on your spouse if you're in a high-level
government position dealing with national security concerns.
