Masons the Driving force
behind
the New World Order
This Awareness indicates the masonry
activities are the most powerful aspect of the driving force behind the New
World Order, however, the Masons are controlled by those international bankers
who are the more powerful controlling forces directing the bringing about
of the New World Order. It is well understood by most Christian organizations
and thus, right wing organizations, that Masonry is indeed part of that effort
to create a
New World Order, and that masonry has down through the ages played
an important part.
Changing the name
of the New World Order
The entity Pike as being a key player
in attempting to set up the works and organizations in the United States and
also in other countries to bring about the World Government, which is another
term for what recently has been called the New World Order. This Awareness
indicates that these entities are likely to change the name from New World
Order to something totally different. (World Governance-Ed)
This Awareness indicates they not
inform entities that the purpose of "no boundaries, no religion, and
One World Government", is to enslave the 95% of the masses, for 5% of
the rulers of the world, and that slavery is not really much to prefer over
war that has happened in free countries during the past century.
Creating
fear and problems as tools
This Awareness indicates that if
you do not settle for the New World Order, then the alternative would be continued
war, but the wars themselves have been financed and controlled by these same
5% of the people who have ruled in the past, and the 5% will now be rulers
in the future and the 95% will be totally disarmed and without any power such
as the vote, or any chance of throwing off the yokes of poverty. This Awareness
indicates the trick has always been, if you want to change people to get them
to take certain bait, then you create fear over here, create a problem to
make them run from it, so that they will go to that which is the trap you
have set for them. Thus you herd them into the pen or trap, and they think
they have escaped something terrible.
