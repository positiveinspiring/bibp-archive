While on a speaking engagement in Malaysia organized by "Success Resources
Company", former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was the object of an
articulate protest movement demanding his indictment for war crimes.
This was no ordinary protest. Tony Blair has been accused of war crimes in a
legal initiative led by the country's former Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir
Mohamad.
A War Crimes Tribunal as well as a War Crimes Commission were set up
integrated by renowned jurists. Documentary evidence of war crimes committed
by Blair and Bush has been carefully compiled and collected since 2006.
The
prosecution is led by several of Malaysia's most prominent lawyers.
Dr Mahathir in a public statement,
"expressed disgust at the companies that
had sponsored Blair's visit here. 'How can you sponsor and get advice from a
liar? Do you also intend to lie in carrying out your business?' he asked."

Rather than mingling with delegates to the venue, Blair was hiding in the
VIP lounge of the Kuala Lumpur Convention Center, surrounded by British and
Malaysian security personnel.
Upon entering the main convention hall, Tony
Blair was very close to being served with an indictment for war crimes:
-
Acting Chairman of the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission, Mr. Zainur
Zakaria
-
Chief Prosecutor of the War Crimes Commission, Mr. Matthias Chang
[barrister]
-
two members of the Perdana Global Peace
Organization, Mr. Ram
Karthigasu and Mr. Christopher Chang
-
a representative of the Malaysian Kwong Siew Association (one of the largest Chinese clan association)
-
two representatives of the Iraq
Community in Malaysia evaded the security by registering themselves
as delegates
At 8.30 am, members of NGOs gathered at the entrance of the convention
center to protest against the visit of war criminal Blair.
Undercover teams
were dispatched to the three separate entrances to confront and attempt to
serve the war crimes indictment on Blair. But he could not be seen entering
the convention centre.
He had entered surreptitiously and was hiding in a VIP room just above the
convention hall where the function was held. His original schedule was
10.00am this morning. But organizers issued statements that no schedule is
available.
British and Malaysian security officers were seen patrolling the corridors
and had identified the seven delegates who were waiting for Blair. They kept
a close watch on the delegates. Mind games began when rumors were spread
that Blair would not be speaking today.
Hints were given that Blair would be
speaking on Sunday in the hope that the seven delegates would abandon their
vigil.
-
At 11.25am, the seven delegates discovered that Blair was hiding in the VIP
room just above the convention hall. They took their positions, with three
members tasked with taking photographs.
-
At 11.30am Blair and his team of goons descended from the VIP room and
walked towards the VIP entrance of the convention hall.
Mr. Matthias Chang and Mr. Zainur Zakaria rushed forward to serve the
indictment, while the Iraqi representatives loudly denounced Blair "mass
murderer, war criminal, shame on you," repeatedly. Blair was obviously
unsettled and put on an embarrassed smile.
-
Mr. Matthias Chang and Mr. Zainur Zakaria were prevented from handing the
indictment to Blair by over 30 British and Malaysian security personnel.
Both of them denounced Blair within earshot, "War criminal, shame on you!
Mass Murderer!"
-
Mr. Zainur Zakaria also shouted at the Malaysian security personnel, "Why
are you protecting a war criminal?" The security officers could only respond
with a silly expression.
-
Having arrogantly told the Chilcot Inquiry in London that he had no regrets
for invading Iraq notwithstanding there were no WMDs, Blair displayed
cowardice in the face of only seven delegates.
-
The Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission stated that this is only the
beginning of a global campaign to ostracize war criminals like Blair and
Bush and urge people the world over to adopt similar campaigns against Bush
and Blair.

on Charges of War Crimes, Global Research, April 24, 2010)
While these unfolding events have been acknowledged by the Malaysian press,
Tony Blair's visit to Malaysia has passed virtually unnoticed in the United
Kingdom.
In fact, outside of Malaysia, the issue has not received press
coverage.
Deafening silence and complicity of the British media?
One would expect that
people in Britain would want to know what happened to Tony Blair in Kuala
Lumpur.

Fears of Arrest and Prosecution by Tony Blair on Charges

War criminal Blair, the keynote speaker at the National Achievers Conference
organized by Success Resources, a sycophant Singapore outfit at the Sunway
Pyramid Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur, hid in fear at the threat that
members of the Malaysian anti-war NGOs would throw slippers at him and that
members of the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission would serve an indictment
for war crimes.
Extensive security measures were put in place before his arrival for the
three-day event.
For the first time, delegates to the conference had no
itinerary of the speakers invited to speak at the convention. Organizers and
delegates were not even told when speakers were scheduled to speak.
There
was a total black out!
Delegates have to wear a special wrist band for the entire duration of the
convention for identification purposes and anyone without the security wrist
band was not allowed to enter the vicinity of the convention hall.
Acting Chairman of the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission, Mr. Zainur
Zakaria, Chief Prosecutor of the War Crimes Commission, Mr. Matthias Chang,
two members of the Perdana Global Peace Organization, Mr. Ram Karthigasu and
Mr. Christopher Chang, a representative of the Malaysian Kwong Siew
Association (one of the largest Chinese clan association) and two
representatives of the Iraq Community in Malaysia evaded the security by
registering themselves as delegates.
