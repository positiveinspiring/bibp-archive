North American Aerospace Defense Command
(NORAD)
operating the nuclear survivable space surveillance and war command center
deep inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado Springs, Colorado.
In the event of a nuclear holocaust, that nuclear waste would last 450,000
years. No one lives that long so the mentality that this envisions is a waste
of taxpayer dollars and needs to be abolished. Moreover, the current powers
that be deliberately don't instigate a nuclear war because they know that
none of them would survive either.
These people are smart. They wouldn't do anything that would jeopardise
their lives, or would they? Stay available everyone. Don't leave me after
the first year. There is so much more to learn about the elites.
