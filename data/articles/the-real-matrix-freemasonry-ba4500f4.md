"The Mysteries Of Magic' by Eliphas Levi
"What is more absurd and more
impious than to attribute the name of Lucifer to the devil, that
is, to personified evil. The intellectual Lucifer is the spirit
of intelligence and love; it is the paraclete, it is the Holy
Spirit, while the physical Lucifer is the great agent of
universal magnetism."

"First Conjuration Addressed to
Emperor Lucifer. Emperor Lucifer, Master and Prince of
Rebellious Spirits, I adjure thee to leave thine abode, in
what-ever quarter of the world it may be situated and come
hither to communicate with me. I command and I conjure thee in
the Name of the Mighty Living God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
to appear without noise and without ...."

"I hereby promise the Great Spirit
Lucifuge, Prince of Demons, that each year I will bring unto him
a human soul to do with as as it may please him, and in return
Lucifuge promises to bestow upon me the treasures of the earth
and fulfill my every desire for the length of my natural life. If
I fail to bring him each year the offering specified above, then
my own soul shall be forfeit to him. Signed..... { Invocant
signs pact with his own blood } "

'The Lost Keys Of Freemasonry'
by Manly Palmer Hall 33째
"When The Mason learns that the Key
to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the
dynamo of living power, he has learned the Mystery of his Craft.
The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he
may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to
properly apply this energy."

'The Secret Doctrine'
by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky
"Lucifer
represents.. Life.. Thought.. Progress.. Civilization..
Liberty.. Independence.. Lucifer is the Logos.. the Serpent, the
Savior."
on pages 171, 225, 255 (Volume II)
"It is Satan who is the God of our planet and the only God."
pages 215, 216, 220, 245, 255, 533,
(VI)
"The Celestial Virgin which thus becomes the Mother of Gods and
Devils at one and the same time; for she is the ever-loving
beneficent Deity... but in antiquity and reality Lucifer or Luciferius is the name. Lucifer is divine and
terrestrial Light,
'the Holy Ghost' and "Satan' at one and the same time."
page 539 (Volume?)

"That which we must say to a crowd is - We worship a God,
but it is the God that one adores without superstition. To you,
Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may
repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees -
The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the
high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian
Doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay whose deeds
prove his cruelty, perfidy and hatred of man, barbarism and
repulsion for science, would Adonay and his priests, calumniate
him? Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay is also god.
For the eternal law is that there is
no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white
without black, for the absolute can only exist as two gods:
darkness being necessary to the statue, and the brake to the
locomotive. Thus, the doctrine of Satanism is a heresy; and the
true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer,
the equal of Adonay; but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good,
is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness
and Evil."

La Femme et l'Enfant dans la FrancMaconnerie Universelle on page 588
"Lucifer, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give
to the Spirit of Darkness! Lucifer, the son of the morning! Is
it he who bears the Light, and with it's splendors intolerable
blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!"
