Julian Assanges WikiLeaks website on Thursday started
publishing more than 100 US Department of Defense
documents including the first prisoner treatment manual for
Guantanamo Bay.
The latest release by the anti-secrecy site comes as Assange, who faces
charges of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, remains holed up in the
Ecuadoran embassy in London with what Quito says are health problems.
Assange said in a statement that the newly released documents exposed
military detention policies at camps in Iraq and at the Guantanamo Bay Naval
Base in Cuba following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
Among the documents is the 2002 manual for staff at Camp Delta at
Guantanamo, shortly after it was set up by US President
George W. Bush to house alleged Al-Qaeda and Taliban
detainees from the war
on terror.
This document is of significant historical
importance. Guantanamo Bay has become the symbol for systematized human
rights abuse in the West with good reason, said Assange, the founder of
the website.
He added:
The Detainee Policies show the anatomy
of the beast that is post-9/11 detention, the carving out of a dark
space where law and rights do not apply, where persons can be detained
without a trace at the convenience of the US Department of Defense.
It shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown
enemy and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving
into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds
itself in, a decade later.
US President
Barack
Obama vowed within hours of taking office in January 2009
that he would close Guantanamo Bay, saying it was acting as a
recruiting tool for Islamist extremists.
But Obama has so far failed to do so in the face of deep opposition in
Congress to moving inmates to the US mainland, and several people accused of
involvement in
the 9/11 plots are on trial at the camp.
WikiLeaks first enraged Washington in 2010 by publishing a flood of secret
military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a huge cache
of diplomatic cables from US embassies across the world.
Assange, 41, walked into the Ecuadoran embassy in London on June 19 seeking
asylum in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces questioning
over alleged rape and sexual assault.
He was granted asylum on August 16 but Britain has refused to grant him safe
passage out of the country, and he remains in the embassy.
Ecuador said on Wednesday it has requested a meeting with Britain to discuss
the health of Assange, who it says is losing weight and suffering vision
problems.
