Not so long ago, a high-ranking Chinese
official, who obviously had concluded that America's decline and China's
rise were both inevitable, noted in a burst of candor to a senior U.S.
official:
"But, please, let America not decline too
quickly."
Although the inevitability of the Chinese
leader's expectation is still far from certain, he was right to be cautious
when looking forward to America's demise.
For if America falters, the world is unlikely to be dominated by a single
preeminent successor - not even China. International uncertainty, increased
tension among global competitors, and even outright chaos would be far more
likely outcomes.
While a sudden, massive crisis of the American system - for instance,
another financial crisis - would produce a fast-moving chain reaction
leading to global political and economic disorder, a steady drift by America
into increasingly pervasive decay or endlessly widening warfare with Islam
would be unlikely to produce, even by 2025, an effective global successor.
No single power will be ready by then to
exercise the role that the world, upon the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991,
expected the United States to play: the leader of a new, globally
cooperative world order.
More probable would be a protracted phase of
rather inconclusive realignments of both global and regional power, with no
grand winners and many more losers, in a setting of international
uncertainty and even of potentially fatal risks to global well-being.
Rather than a world where dreams of democracy
flourish, a Hobbesian world of enhanced national security based on varying
fusions of authoritarianism, nationalism, and religion could ensue.
The leaders of the world's second-rank powers, among them India, Japan,
Russia, and some European countries, are already assessing the potential
impact of U.S. decline on their respective national interests.
-
The Japanese,
fearful of an assertive China dominating the Asian mainland, may be thinking
of closer links with Europe.
-
Leaders in India and Japan may be considering
closer political and even military cooperation in case America falters and
China rises.
-
Russia, while perhaps engaging in wishful thinking (even
schadenfreude) about America's uncertain
prospects, will almost certainly have its eye on the independent states of
the former Soviet Union.
Europe, not yet cohesive, would likely be pulled
in several directions:
-
Germany and Italy toward Russia because of
commercial interests
-
France and insecure Central Europe in favor of a
politically tighter European Union
-
Britain toward manipulating a
balance within the EU while preserving its special relationship with a
declining United States
Others may move more rapidly to carve out their
own regional spheres:
Turkey in the area of the old Ottoman
Empire, Brazil in the Southern Hemisphere, and so forth.
None of these countries, however, will have the
requisite combination of economic, financial, technological, and military
power even to consider inheriting America's leading role.
China, invariably mentioned as America's prospective successor, has an
impressive imperial lineage and a strategic tradition of carefully
calibrated patience, both of which have been critical to its overwhelmingly
successful, several-thousand-year-long history.
China thus prudently accepts the existing
international system, even if it does not view the prevailing hierarchy as
permanent.
It recognizes that success depends not on the
system's dramatic collapse but on its evolution toward a gradual
redistribution of power. Moreover, the basic reality is that China is not
yet ready to assume in full America's role in the world.
Beijing's leaders themselves have repeatedly
emphasized that on every important measure of development, wealth, and
power, China will still be a modernizing and developing state several
decades from now, significantly behind not only the United States but also
Europe and Japan in the major per capita indices of modernity and national
power.
Accordingly, Chinese leaders have been
restrained in laying any overt claims to global leadership.
At some stage, however, a more assertive Chinese nationalism could arise and
damage China's international interests. A swaggering, nationalistic Beijing
would unintentionally mobilize a powerful regional coalition against itself.
None of China's key neighbors - India, Japan,
and Russia - is ready to acknowledge China's entitlement to America's place
on the global totem pole.
They might even seek support from a waning
America to offset an overly assertive China. The resulting regional scramble
could become intense, especially given the similar nationalistic tendencies
among China's neighbors. A phase of acute international tension in Asia
could ensue.
Asia of the 21st century could then
begin to resemble Europe of the 20th century - violent and
bloodthirsty.
At the same time, the security of a number of weaker states located
geographically next to major regional powers also depends on the
international status quo reinforced by America's global preeminence - and
would be made significantly more vulnerable in proportion to America's
decline.
The states in that exposed position, including,
-
Georgia
-
Taiwan
-
South Korea
-
Belarus
-
Ukraine
-
Afghanistan
-
Pakistan
-
Israel
-
the greater Middle East,
...are today's geopolitical equivalents of
nature's most endangered species.
Their fates are closely tied to the nature of
the international environment left behind by a waning America, be it ordered
and restrained or, much more likely, self-serving and expansionist.
A faltering United States could also find its strategic partnership with
Mexico in jeopardy. America's economic resilience and political stability
have so far mitigated many of the challenges posed by such sensitive
neighborhood issues as economic dependence, immigration, and the narcotics
trade.
A decline in American power, however, would
likely undermine the health and good judgment of the U.S. economic and
political systems.
A waning United States would likely be more
nationalistic, more defensive about its national identity, more paranoid
about its homeland security, and less willing to sacrifice resources for the
sake of others' development.
The worsening of relations between a declining
America and an internally troubled Mexico could even give rise to a
particularly ominous phenomenon:
the emergence, as a major issue in
nationalistically aroused Mexican politics, of territorial claims
justified by history and ignited by cross-border incidents.
Another consequence of American decline could be
a corrosion of the generally cooperative management of the global commons -
shared interests such as sea lanes, space, cyberspace, and the environment,
whose protection is imperative to the long-term growth of the global economy
and the continuation of basic geopolitical stability.
In almost every case, the potential absence of a
constructive and influential U.S. role would fatally undermine the essential
communality of the global commons because the superiority and ubiquity of
American power creates order where there would normally be conflict.
None of this will necessarily come to pass. Nor is the concern that
America's decline would generate global insecurity, endanger some vulnerable
states, and produce a more troubled North American neighborhood an argument
for U.S. global supremacy.
In fact, the strategic complexities of the world
in the 21st century make such supremacy unattainable. But those
dreaming today of America's collapse would probably come to regret it.
And as the world after America would be
increasingly complicated and chaotic, it is imperative that the United
States pursue a new, timely strategic vision for its foreign policy - or
start bracing itself for a dangerous slide into global turmoil.
