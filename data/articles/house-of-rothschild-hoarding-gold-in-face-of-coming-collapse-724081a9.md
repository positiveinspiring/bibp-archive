A recent
appointment of
Rothschild
as financial advisor by the Board of Directors of gold exploration company
Spanish Mountain Gold is yet another unmistakable indication that the
ancient family is moving the worlds gold supply to both emerging markets
and Central Banks worldwide, strengthening the familys monopoly position
when the fiat-based house of cards comes crashing down in the West.
The Board of Directors of the British Columbia
based gold exploration company
appointed Rothschild to review strategic options with the objective of
maximizing shareholder value.
In July of 2012, Spanish Mountain Golds CEO
Brian Groves boasted already that the excavation in British Columbia is
a project worth several million ounces in gold and is backed by an
enormous network of connections globally,
Groves told Resource Clips.
Indeed, this recent appointment of Rothschilds
financial expertise (from centuries worth of experience) has increased the
value of this company somewhat, propelling the gold-producing company into
newer heights (or depths), depending on what end of the gold bar you find
yourself. It also is a sure sign that the family is tightening its grip on
gold, in both the excavation, the producing and the trading phase.
In the beginning of this century there were
signs that Rothschild was starting to pull back from gold.
With the announcement of Lord Jacob Rothschild
that his investment vehicle RIT Capital Partners has ridden the rally in
gold prices but will now incrementally sell down many observers were led to
believe the ancient house was abandoning the precious stuff.
Jacob Rothschild
stated in 2011:
There is I believe a growing
awareness of the dangerous position which confronts many countries,
particularly those in the developed world.
In spite of these concerns,
we continue to take advantage of areas that we believe are attractive,
but we will remain cautious in terms of the quantum of capital that we
allocate.
Already in 2004 Rothschild blew the horn,
announcing with a loud voice (that tends to carry far and wide throughout
the worlds financial community) that the family was withdrawing from its
gold-based assets.
In April of 2004 the
Telegraph reported:
The investment bank that has chaired the
London meetings setting the world gold price since 1919 is quitting the
market.
In 2011, an analysis makes clear how and why
Rothschild manipulates the price of gold downward:
Despite these earlier indications that
Rothschild was backing away from its gold assets (which smell like the
calculated diversion techniques of an experienced illusionist), the recent
appointment in the Spanish Mountain project is a clear sign that gold is
still foremost on the mind of the family, as it has been for many centuries
past.
These earlier maneuverings by Rothschild seem to
suggest a consciously constructed effort to bring down the price of gold-
with the aim of buying large quantities later on, when the price was
especially low.
The reason for such a move is
explained by Jeff Thomas in February 2012, when
he wrote:
Many economists project that, following the
crashes of the Euro and the dollar, a return to gold-backed currencies
would appear as a world trend. This is only natural, as the fiat
currency concept would have been shown to be the farce that it is.
For this reason, Thomas argued, the hoarding of
gold is being done with the aim of redistributing it later on to those
nations (or supra-nations, such as the EU and China) the elite have destined
to be the future global engines after the old one has been discarded:
It is entirely possible that all currencies
could receive a shake-up, and an entire worldwide system of gold-backed
currencies may develop. If this were to occur, the countries that held
the largest amounts of gold at that time would be out in front
economically.
This indeed seems to be the case.
As Edmond de Rothschilds France-based
asset management company
analyzes for 2013, the so called emerging markets are increasingly
scooping great chunks of gold from the worlds supply:
It is (
) reassuring to see that
physical demand has started the year well with an increase in Chinese
and Indian buying. The Chinese are buying before the Lunar New Year
while Indians seem to be anticipating higher duties on imported gold.
At
the same time, central bank buying continues. They bought 536 tonnes in
2012 (+17% on record 2011 levels) or 13% of total demand.
Another document (below images) issued by Edmond
de Rothschilds Goldsphere-enterprise analyzes the global gold-trade, the
buyers, the sellers, the winners and the losers.
In one of its assessments
the global elite recognizes that European nations are reluctant to sell
their gold stocks and the current trend is a continuous rover of gold
towards the East:
European countries are in no rush to sell
their bullion reserves as they are small in value compared to their debt
problems and some of the gold might already have been pledged in
collateralized loans.
While all the major strongholds of the elite are
being abandoned in the US, new lairs are being set up in China.
The document concludes by saying that
gold-producing companies and miners are not sufficiently riding the wave of
ever-rising gold prices:
All the recent meetings we have had with
gold companies tend to confirm the industrys acceptance that gold mines
and gold projects have to be better managed so as to get shareholder
returns more in line with the current strong gold price.
And some
projects have in fact already been postponed or cancelled because of
insufficient profitability.

This puts the recent appointment of Rothschild
by Spanish Mountain Gold somewhat into perspective doesnt it?
It seems the ancient
House of Rothschild has
feigned a retreat from gold in the beginning of this century, only to then
snatch it again at a good prize and move it into the East - their future
global engine.
When Baron Benjamin de Rothschild was asked by
Israeli newspaper
Haaretz what the familys intentions are in regards to China, he
answered unhesitatingly,
to increase our focus in that region.
As the elites engine of control is
incrementally deconstructed in the West, the worlds gold is gradually
moving towards its new engine in the East.
