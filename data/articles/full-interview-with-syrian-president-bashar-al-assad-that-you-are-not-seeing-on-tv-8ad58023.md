"The U.S. Used
Depleted Uranium In
Iraq,
Israel Used
White Phosphorous In Gaza,
And Nobody Said
Anything About 'Red Lines'!"
There's a reason you're only getting snippets about Assad's supposed "chilling
warning" of "repercussions" to the U.S. if his country is
invaded, it's because he calmly and succinctly exposed
Obama
and the US government's hypocrisy through and through.
For one, Assad says there's no evidence his regime used chemical weapons,
but notes such illegal weapons were used by the U.S. in Iraq and Israel in
Gaza.
He says if the U.S. has evidence his government carried out the chemical
weapons attacks, then they should present it to the American people to
judge, whom he notes are overwhelmingly against Obama's war.
Assad reminds Charlie Rose (American CBS) the last time the U.S.
presented "evidence" of WMDs was Colin Powell at
the
United Nations making the case Iraq had WMDs (and could
attack the U.S. with them within 45 minutes"), which we all know now
was a fabrication.
He makes so many good points you'd almost think he wasn't another slimy
politician, though I had to laugh at one point because he says how the
weapons the Syrian government has are legal because "they are the
government," whereas the weapons the rebels have are illegal, because
they're not the government.
All animals are equal, but some are more equal
than others.
