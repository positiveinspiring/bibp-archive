Chapter Four
How the Illuminati Program People
An Overview of Some Basic Types of Programming
In the first few chapters, I defined Illuminism, its reach, and some
of the philosophy, money making enterprises, and agendas that help explain
WHY they program people. I believe that these are important to understand,
as a preface to the next few chapters. Why? The programming techniques
that I will describe take an incredible amount of effort, time, dedication,
and planning on the part of the cult to place in the individual. Only
a very motivated group of people would spend the time it takes to do
this. These chapters are very hard for me to write, as an individual,
since my role in the cult was that of a programmer. So, the very techniques
you will be reading about were often those that I used to place programming
in individuals that I worked with. I no longer do these things, nor
do I espouse doing them; the reason I am writing this book is that I
believe that therapists who work with DID, as well as survivors, deserve
to know WHAT is done to people, HOW it is done, as well as be given
some ideas on how to undo the programming that the cult places in people.
First, I would like to address unintentional programming versus intentional
programming. This is also known as the environmental milieu the child
is raised in. The programming of a generational Illuminati infant often
begins before its birth (this will be addressed later) but once it is
born, the very environment the infant is raised in becomes a form of
programming. Often, the infant is raised in a family environment that
combines daytime abandonment with dysfunction in the parental figures.
The infant soon learns that the nighttime, and cult activities, are
the truly important ones. The infant may be deprived of attention, or
even abused, in the daytime; and is only treated as special, or "seen"
by the parent, in the cult setting. This can lead to very young alters
around the core or core splits, who feel "invisible", abandoned,
rejected, unworthy of love or attention, or that they don't even exist,
unless they are doing a job for their "family".
Another milieu and conditioning process the infant must face is that
the adults around him/her are INCONSISTENT, since the adults in a generational
cult family are almost always also multiple, or DID. This sets up a
reality for the infant/toddler that the parents act one way at home;
an entirely different way at cult gatherings; and yet a different way
in normal society.
Since these are the infant's earliest experiences of adults and adult
behaviors, it has no choice but to accept this reality that human beings
act in shockingly different ways in different settings. While unintentional,
this sets the infant up for later dissociation, in mimicry of the adults
around it.
Intentional Programming
Intentional programming of an infant in the Illuminati often begins
before birth. Prenatal splitting is well known in the cult, as the fetus
is very capable of fragmenting in the womb due to trauma. This is usually
done between the seventh and ninth month of pregnancy. Techniques used
include: placing headphones on the mother's abdomen, and playing loud,
discordant music (such as some modern classical pieces, or even Wagner's
operas). Loud, heavy rock has also been used. Other methods include
having the mother ingest quantities of bitter substances, to make the
amniotic fluid bitter, or yelling at the fetus inside the womb. The
mother's abdomen may be hit as well. Mild shock to the abdomen may be
applied, especially when term is near, and may be used to cause premature
labor, or ensure that the infant is born on a ceremonial holiday. Certain
labor inducing drugs may be also given if a certain birth date is desired.
Once the infant is born, testing is begun at a very early age, usually
during the first few weeks of life. The trainers, who are taught to
look for certain qualities in the infant, will place it on a velvet
cloth on a table, and check its reflexes to different stimuli. The infant's
strength, how it reacts to heat, cold, and pain are all tested. Different
infants react differently, and the trainers are looking for dissociative
ability, quick reflexes, and reaction times. They are also encouraging
early dissociation in the infant with these tests.
The infant will also be abused, to create fragments. Methods of abuse
can include: rectal probes; digital anal rape; electric shocks at low
levels to the fingers, toes, and genitalia; cutting the genitalia in
ritual circumstances (in older infants). The intent is to begin fragmentation
before a true ego state develops, and customize the infant to pain and
reflexive dissociation from pain (yes, even tiny infants dissociate;
I have seen it time and time again; they will glow blank and limp, or
glassy, in the face of continued trauma.)
Isolation and abandonment programming will sometimes be begun as well,
in a rudimentary sense. The infant is abandoned, or uncared for by adults,
intentionally during the daytime, then picked up, soothed, cleaned up
and paid attention to in the context of preparing for a ritual or group
gathering. This is done in order to help the infant associate night
gatherings with "love" and attention, and to help the bonding
process to the cult, or "family". The infant will be taught
to associate maternal attention with going to rituals, and eventually
will associate cult gatherings with feelings of security.
As the infant grows older, i.e. at 15 to 18 months, more fragmenting
is intentionally done by having the parents as well as cult members
abuse the infant more methodically. This is done by intermittently soothing,
bonding with the infant, then shocking it on its digits; the infant
may be dropped from heights to a mat or mattress and laughed at as it
lays there startled and terrified, crying. It may be placed in cages
for periods of time, or exposed to short periods of isolation. Deprivation
of food, water, and basic needs may begin later in this stage. All of
these methods are done in order to create intentional dissociation in
the infant. The infant of this age may be taken to group meetings, but
outside of special occasions, or dedications, will have no active role
yet in the cult setting. The small infants are usually left with a cult
member, or caretaker, who watches them during the group's activities;
this caretaker role is usually rotated among lower level or teenage
members.
Between the ages of 20 and 24 months, the toddler may begin the "steps
of discipline" which the Illuminati use to teach their children.
The age the child begins them will vary, depending upon the group, the
parent, the trainer, and the child. These "steps of discipline"
would be better called "steps of torment and abuse" as their
purpose is to create a highly dissociative child, out of touch with
their feelings, who is completely and unthinkingly loyal to the cult.
The order of the steps may also be varied a little, depending on the
whims of the trainer or parents.
I will first discuss the first five steps of discipline: (note: these
steps may vary somewhat from region to region, but most follow this
outline at least roughly, even if not in the same order)
First step: to not need
The small toddler/child is placed in a room without any sensory stimulus,
usually a training room with gray, white, or beige walls. The adult
leaves and the child is left alone, for periods of time: these may vary
from hours, to an entire day as the child grows older. If the child
begs the adult to stay, and not leave, or screams, the child is beaten,
and told that the periods of isolation will increase until they learn
to stop being weak. The ostensible purpose of this discipline is to
teach the child to rely on its own internal resources, and not on outside
people ("strengthen it"). What it actually does is create
a huge terror of abandonment within the child. When the adult, or trainer,
returns to the room, the child is often found rocking itself, or hugging
itself in a corner, occasionally almost catatonic from fear. The trainer
will then "rescue" the child, feed and give it something to
drink and bond with the child as their "savior". The trainer
will tell them the "family" told the trainer to rescue the
child, because its family "loves" it. The trainer will instill
cult teachings, at this point, into the helpless, fearful, and almost
insanely grateful child who has just been "rescued" from isolation.
The trainer will reinforce in the child over and over how much it "needs
" its family, who just rescued it from death by starvation or abandonment.
This will teach the very young toddler to associate comfort and security
with bonding with its trainer, who may be one of its parents, and being
with "family" members. The cult is very aware of child developmental
principles, and has developed exercises like the above after hundreds
of years of teaching very young children.
Second step: to not want
This step is very similar to the first step, and actually reinforces
it. It will be done intermittently with the first step over the next
few years of the child's life. Again, the child is left alone in a training
room, or isolated room, without food or water for a long period of time.
An adult will enter the room, with a large pitcher of ice water, or
food. If the child asks for either, as the adult is eating or drinking
in front of the child, he/she is severely punished for being weak and
needy. This step is reinforced, until the child learns not to ask for
food or water unless it is offered first. The ostensible reason the
cult gives for this step is that it creates a child who is strong, and
can go without food and water for longer and longer periods of time.
The real reason this is done is that it creates a child who is completely
dissociated from its own needs for food, water, or other comforts, who
becomes afraid to ask outside adults for help. This creates in the child
a hyper-vigilance as she/he learns to look for outside adults for cues
on when it is okay to fulfill needs, and not to trust her/his own body
signals. The child is already learning to look outside itself to others
to learn how it should think or feel, instead of trusting its own feelings.
The cult now becomes the locus of control for the child.
Third step: to not wish
The child is placed in a room with favorite toys, or objects. A kind
adult comes into the room and engages the child in play. This adult
my be a friend, aunt, parent, or trainer. The child and adult may engage
in fantasy play about the child's secret wishes, dreams, or wants. This
will occur on several occasions, and the child's trust is slowly gained.
At some later point, the child is severely punished for any aspect of
wishing or fantasy shared with the adult, including the destruction
of favorite toys, going in and undoing or destroying secret safe places
the child may have created, or even destroying non cult protectors.
This step is repeated, with variations, many times over the ensuing
years. Occasionally, the child's siblings, parents, or friends will
be used to reveal inside fantasies the child has revealed to them during
the daytime, or in unguarded moments. The ostensible reason the cult
gives for this step is to create a child who doesn't fantasize, who
is more outwardly directed, less inwardly directed. In other words,
the child is to look to adults for permission in all aspects of its
life, including internal. The reality is that this step destroys all
safe places the child has created internally, to retreat from the horrors
it is experiencing. This step creates in the child the feeling that
there is no true safety, that the cult will find out everything it thinks.
Exercises like this are also used to create young alters in the child
who will self report to the cult trainers any secret safe places, or
covert wishes against the cult, that other alters have. This will then
begin to set up intersystem hostility and divisiveness, which the cult
will manipulate throughout the person's life span in order to control
them.
Fourth step: the survival of the fittest
This step is used in order to begin creating perpetrator alters in
the young child. ALL CULT MEMBERS WILL BE EXPECTED TO BECOME PERPETRATORS;
THIS BEGINS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD. The child is brought into a room where
there is a trainer and another child of approximately the same age,
or slightly younger, that the child being taught. The child is severely
beaten, for a long period of time, by the trainer, then told to hit
the other child in the room, or they will be beaten further. If the
child refuses, it is punished severely, the other child is punished
as well, then the child is told to punish the other child. If the child
continues to refuse, or cries, or tries to hit the trainer instead,
they will continue to be beaten severely, and told to hit the other
child, to direct its anger at the other child. This step is repeated
until the child finally complies. This step is begun around age 2 to
2 1/2, and is used to create aggressive perpetrator alters in the young
child. As the child becomes older, the punishing tasks become more and
more brutal. Children are expected to become perpetrators of others
at very young ages, and will "practice" on children younger
than themselves, with the encouragement and rewarding by the adults
around them. They will also be mimicking these adults, who role model
perpetration constantly as normal. The child will be taught that this
is the acceptable outlet for the aggressive impulses and rage that are
created by the brutality the child is constantly being exposed to.
Fifth step: the code of silence
Many, many different stratagems are used to put this in, starting at
around the age of two years old, when a child starts becoming more verbal.
Usually, after a ritual or group gathering, the child is asked about
what they saw, or heard, during the meeting. Like most obedient young
children, they will comply. They are immediately severely beaten, or
tortured, and a new alter is created, who is told to keep or guard the
memories of what was seen, on pain of their life. The new part always
agrees. The child and this new part are put through a ceremony of swearing
to never ever tell; and alters are created whose job it is to kill the
body, if the other parts ever remember.
The child is also put through severe psychological torture to ensure
that it will never be tempted to tell, including: being buried alive;
near drowning; watching "traitor's deaths" involving slow
painful torture, such as being burned, or skinned alive; being buried
with a partially rotted corpse and being told that they will become
a corpse like it if they ever tell, etc. The scenarios go on and on,
invented by people with endlessly cruel imaginations, in order to ensure
the secrecy of the young child. These methods have been perfected over
hundreds of years of practice by the cult with its children. The reason
these things are done is self evident: the cult is involved in criminal
activities, as explained in the first few chapters of this book, and
they want to ensure the continued silence of its children. This is one
reason why the cult has survived so long, and with its continued shroud
of secrecy; why more survivors are afraid/unwilling to disclose their
abuse. In order to reveal cult secrets, a child must go against some
of the most tremendously horrendous psychological trauma and abuse imaginable;
even as an adult, the survivor has difficulty putting these things aside,
when discussing their abuse. Children and adults alike are told that
if they ever tell, they will be hunted down and shot (the assassin training
lets the child know that this is no idle threat); that they will be
tortured slowly. The child will be exposed to setups and role plays
throughout their growing up that reinforces this step.
Suggestions That May Help
I believe in also offering some ideas on how to undo some of the above
mentioned programming, as I do not believe in knowledge, only for knowledge's
sake. The survivor often needs tools, in order to try and undo some
of the horrendous abuse that the cult places him/her through, especially
as memories of these things occur. THESE ARE JUST MEANT AS HELPFUL HINTS
AND DO NOT REPLACE THE ADVICE OF A GOOD THERAPIST.
-
Early milieu programming: This is difficult to undo, since it hits
on core abandonment issues, and rejection, for the survivor. This
will often have been the survivor's very first, earliest experiences
as an infant, involving its relationship with its parents and primary
family members. Working on this requires the whole hearted effort
of all alter systems inside, to join in nurturing the core splits
who experienced severe parental rejection, and the cognitive recognition
that the DAYTIME was important, too; that the adults around the
infant were the unhealthy ones. The infant's often feel unlovable,
overly needy, depressed; but nurturing alters inside can help comfort
them, and share the reality that the infant really was loveable,
no matter what the outside adults around it were like. Here, too,
an outside supportive therapist, and a strong, nurturing faith system,
can help tremendously in the healing process, as new messages are
brought in to the abandoned, wounded parts. Sorting through what
happened, grieving over the real issues of abandonment, and bringing
reality to very young, deeply wounded parts will take time.
-
Early intentional fragmentation: (ages 0 to 24 months) Usually
there are cognitive parts of the survivor inside, who have never
ever forgotten the abuse, and can help share the cognitive reality
of the abuse with the amnesic alters. This should be done extremely
slowly, since this first abuse was done quite early in life. Creating
an internal nursery, with safe toys, objects, can help. Older nurturing
adult alters inside can help hold and care for the wounded infants
inside the nursery, while acknowledging and grieving over the abuse
which occurred. It is important to believe an validate the young
parts when they come forward to share. Allowing them nonverbal ways
of expressing themselves can help, as these are quite young parts,
who often cannot talk yet. Having older children inside who are
close to the infants verbalize their wants, needs, and fears can
also help, as often the youngest parts inside do not trust ANY adults,
even internal ones. A strong ,caring outside therapist is also important
to healing, by modeling healthy nurturing to a system that may have
no concept of this, while balancing the need of the infant for outside
nurture with the need for the internal system(s) to learn their
own self nurture techniques. Internal helpers can reach the infants,
ground them, share present reality (that the body is older, the
infants are safe, etc. These helpers may be internal older children,
as mentioned before). The survivor may also want to find support
adults when possible, who can help with modeling healthy caring
with good boundaries.
A THERAPIST OR FRIEND CANNOT RE-PARENT THE SURVIVOR. The survivor
will long for this, but realistically, the survivor has one set
of parents, good or bad, or sadly, even terrible. No outside person
can come in and redo the complete re-parenting of another. What
the therapist and support person can offer will be caring, empathy,
listening, while the survivor grieves over the loss of adequate
nurture. They can offer friendship or empathy with good boundaries.
They cannot become the survivor's parents, or therapy will not progress.
Instead, enmeshment will begin.
-
The First Five Steps of Discipline (there are twelve total; others
will be addressed in later chapters) Try to find the parts that
experienced the abuse. This may mean doing system mapping (drawing
pictures of what things look like inside), and going to the cognitives
(intellectuals) or controllers (head honchos inside) for information.
An internal helper, or recorder, may also be extremely helpful in
doing this.
Allow these parts to slowly acknowledge the agony that they experienced
during their deprivation: heat (being held over a fire, or stove);
cold (such as being placed in freezers, or ice, for example), lack
of food, etc. Encourage the sharing of the cognitive portion of the
memories first, while allowing amnesic alters to grieve over "hearing
about" these things. Allow them time to absorb hearing about
these traumas, as they occurred over several years during early childhood,
and will take time to assimilate. Healing can't be rushed. Allow feeling
alters later to step forward, and share their feelings, while more
cognitive or helper parts are inside holding their hands, grounding
them to the here and now throughout the process of remembering Be
prepared for floods of emotion at times, as well as body memories,
as the abuse is recalled. A group of inside people can be designated
as a "grounding team" to help ground these parts as they
step forward and share their memories.
Remembering safely assumes that the person has a qualified therapist,
and also has laid the groundwork for good intrasystem cooperation, as
discussed above. Memory work should not be done until there is good
communication and cooperation inside, or the person will be overwhelmed
by the memories as they come out. They will be flooded and re-traumatized
instead of helped, and may de-compensate. With good communication, memories
can be brought out a little at a time, in manageable pieces, while cognitive
alters continually help keep the survivor from going completely into
the memory, and they can also help ground the more wounded parts.
The cult will put people through certain types of programming in order
to achieve a specific goal: separating the intellect, or cognition,
form the feelings in a person. Cognitive alters in these systems are
always considered "higher" than the feeling alters; cognitive
alters are taught to "pass down" their feelings to the "lower"
feeling alters. While these labels are untrue, the cognitive alters
will fear feeling the intense, overwhelming emotions that caused them
to split further and further from the more limbic, or feeling alters
internally. This will drive continued system divisiveness in the survivor.
It is important that cognitive parts realize that the feeling alters
are part of them; that they can practice sharing their feelings in SMALL
steps without needing to be flooded, or overwhelmed.
A reminder: EXTERNAL SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT TO UNDOING INSIDE PROGRAMMING.
You HAVE to be able to promise these parts external safety, and deliver
on this promise, or they will understandably balk at working inside
on undoing programming. Why should they try and change, only to go back
and be punished again? No system will undo its own protective dissociation,
if the abuse is ongoing, or it will continue to destabilize and re-dissociate
over and over. This is because dismantling the dissociation would mean
dismantling its own survival and protection. Stopping contact with perpetrators
and having a safe therapist are the very first steps to take, before
attempting to undo internal programming. A system can still work on
stopping cult contact, and begin healing , while being accessed, but
it will slow therapy down tremendously as the internal energy will be
diverted to staying safe rather than undoing trauma. A person can heal,
and most survivors are still in cult contact when they enter therapy.
BUT the progress will go much more quickly once cult contact is broken.
(see chapter on preventing accessing of the survivor)
