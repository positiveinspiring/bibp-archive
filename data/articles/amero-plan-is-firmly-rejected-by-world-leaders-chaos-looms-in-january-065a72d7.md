Once again this week, a lot is happening in the
world and a lot more is about to happen including:
-
the nationalization of Toyotas North
American operations
-
a total regime change in Japan
-
Russia allying
itself with NATO
-
the ongoing release of forbidden technology
-
top
secret negotiations involving the White Dragon Society and the Dragon
family
Above all, there are signs of major chaos
starting in late January as financial power brokers try to settle accounts
by a January 30th deadline in a system that is mathematically
impossible to fix.
In other words, the old regime continues to
crumble while the new waits in the background.
As usual, the United States continued to be the heart of global darkness.
In
an effort to keep the
Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate
going, President
Obama tried very hard during his hectic
travels to Europe and Asia to promote
the Amero but was firmly rejected. The
simple fact of the matter is that the Amero he proposes would just be paper
backed by nothing.
Even the promise to put control in the hands of
the Treasury Department was seen as just a ruse by the powers behind the
Federal Reserve Board to remain in charge. This means the plan to replace
the US dollars owned by non-Americans with a new currency (probably the Hong
Kong dollar) is likely to go ahead.
There will be a meeting soon between a
representative of the
White Dragon Society
and the Dragon family to discuss this.
A senior
Rothschild family source also insists the Euro will not survive
past June of next year because of similar mathematical problems with the
underlying assets that are supposed to back it.
Obama last week asked a senior Chinese power-broker for protection from the
Khazarians who have vowed to have him killed. He has also asked senior
Muslim leaders for protection. It is not clear what answer he got.
The general consensus is that the United States is headed for severe chaos
unless the Pentagon steps in and sets up an interim government. This is
exactly what is going to happen according to a Pentagon Nazi source.
The Pentagon has already begun playing its hand by forcing NATO to end its
policy of hostility to Russia. By including Russia in the NATO missile
shield, the US and Europe have made it clear they will do everything they
can to oppose the birth of a one-China world.
The military and many world governments are also paying close attention to
the impending $1 trillion lawsuit against
Daniele Dal Bosco, the Davos World Forum, the UN and others,
according to a source involved in the lawsuit.
It now appears that elements of the Italian government, including Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi and members of the
Freemason P2 lodge were
planning to buy a bank and use it to cash many stolen financial instruments,
including the $134.5 billion in bonds illegally seized in 2009, as well as,
Perhaps that is why there was little Italian
presence at the just ended NATO summit.
Former Fed Chief Alan Greenspan was also contacted by lawyers
preparing the lawsuit and given a copy of a fax allegedly sent from his
office that implicates him in a $22 billion fraud.
Greenspan said,
I have been guilty of many
things but not this.
As soon as he was given a copy of the document
he called the FBI and reported it as fraudulent.
The lawsuit could be filed as early as this week
and it may lead to major changes in the world power structure. However, it
is likely some sort of agreement will be reached behind the scenes before
the lawsuit proceeds too far.
Big changes have also come to Japan.
The arrest of the Kiyoshi Takayama,
the number two man in the
Yamaguchi Gumi yakuza gang was part of a major
campaign by the police to destroy that organization. Many Japanese Yakuza
are very upset that the sub-group he heads, the Kodo Kai, was murdering
Japanese politicians, financiers and journalists for Khazarian Satanists.
There exists a real danger of a major gang war erupting as a result. The
offices of one of the major Yamaguchi Gumi sub-groups, the Yamaken Gumi, was
attacked with a hand-grenade in what gang sources say was a conflict within
that group.
In any case, the police do have the means to destroy the Yamaguchi Gumi
because Japanese anti-gang laws allow a gang boss to be put in jail for a
crime committed by a junior gang member.
They arrested Takayama on such a charge and any
trial he has will be meaningless because the decision to jail him has
already been made. When Shinobu Tsukasa, the boss of the Yamaguchi gumi
comes out of jail next spring, he will be forced to come to some sort of
agreement with the Japanese government.
The
White Dragon Society and the
Black Dragon Society will invite a
Yamaguchi Gumi representative to negotiations this week to try to convert
the Yamaguchi Gumi into a different type of organization.
In a related move, the Toyota Motor corporation is under severe attack.
According to the president of a major Nagoya-based corporation and a top
American billionaire, a decision has been made to nationalize Toyotas North
American operations. They will do this by bankrupting Toyota US through
product liability lawsuits.
Apparently Toyota misappropriated about 400 trillion yen in Dragon Family
assets back in the 1980s and used them to set up 17 banks around the world
instead of building factories as they promised. There is also a major
lawsuit against Toyota in Japan that will be settled on November 26th.
Toyota was involved in the take-over of the Misawa Home corporation during
the rule of Junichiro Koizumi and Heizo Takenaka. Misawa founder Chiyoji
Misawa insists the take-over was illegal.
Takenakas brother is a senior
executive in the now Toyota-owned Misawa Home.
Both Toyota and the Yamaguchi gumi
Kodo kai are based in Nagoya and
prosecutors are investigating if and how these two organizations are linked.
In any case, the secret balance of power in Japan has now changed and the
most fundamental regime change the country has seen since the end of World
War 2 will begin in January, according to a Japanese secret government
source.
In a final note, it is now clear the gradual release of forbidden technology
has begun.
All it takes to confirm this is to look at the
hydrogen and
electric vehicles being displayed at auto shows.
