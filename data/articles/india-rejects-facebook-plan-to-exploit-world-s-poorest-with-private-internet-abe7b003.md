Internet

In a move that open internet
advocates say will "resonate around the world," India's
top telecom regulator on Monday struck a decisive blow
against
Facebook's "discriminatory" and controlling
internet scheme known as
Free Basics.
The Telecom Regulatory
Authority of India (TRAI) ruled against two-tiered pricing for
different data platforms or content, effectively banning
Free Basics, which only allows users free access to a
small number of curated websites, including Facebook.
"The message is clear,"
declared Renata Avila,
Web We Want program
manager at the World Wide Web Foundation, which was
founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the
web.
"We can't create a
two-tier Internet - one for the haves, and one for
the have-nots. We must connect everyone to the full
potential of the open Web."
"As the country with the
second largest number of Internet users worldwide,
this decision will resonate around the world," Avila
added.
The Prohibition of
Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations,
2016 will,
"disallow service
providers to offer or charge discriminatory tariffs
for data services on the basis of content being
accessed by a consumer," Sudhir Gupta, TRAI
secretary, said in a
statement.
"While formulating the
regulations, the authority has largely been guided
by the principles of net neutrality seeking to
ensure that consumers get unhindered and
non-discriminatory access to the internet," Gupta
said.
Free Basics - which has
launched in 18 mostly developing countries - has
faced
mounting criticisms from net neutrality advocates,
who said the program essentially allowed Facebook to
serve as the internet "gatekeeper"
for hundreds and thousands of the world's poorest
people.
Open internet advocates
celebrated the ruling Monday, which came after the TRAI
issued a
temporary ban on the service in late December in
order to investigate whether it is in violation of net
neutrality protections.
Mishi Choudhary, executive
director of India's Software Freedom Law Center, said
the group is,
"delighted by the
regulator's recognition of the irreversible damage
that stands to be done to the open Internet by
allowing differential pricing."
"Today's decision is a
major victory for free speech and for Internet users
everywhere, no matter what Mark Zuckerberg's
well-paid public relations team might tell you,"
said Evan Greer, campaign director for the
U.S.-based Fight for the Future.
According to the digital
rights group, telecom companies such as T-Mobile and
Verizon have been pushing similar practices in the U.S.,
claiming that they do not violate net neutrality.
"The basic principles of
net neutrality are what have made the Web into what
it is today," Greer continued.
"Zero rating schemes and
discriminatory pricing are just another tool to
favor some applications over others. They allow ISPs
to pick winners and losers, and create the same
harms as fast lanes and slow lanes.
They give Internet
Service Providers too much power to shape Internet
users' online experience, and open the floodgates
for potential censorship and abuse."
Companies that violate the
order will be fined 50,000 rupees per day (around
$740/day) up to a maximum of 5 million rupees, according
to the ruling, which will be reviewed in two years.
As TechCrunch
notes,
"Those numbers are
negligible for Facebook, which has invested millions
in this program, but it's a crucial public opinion
victory against the company that is at stake here."
