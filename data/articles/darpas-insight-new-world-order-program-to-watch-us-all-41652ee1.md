No big surprise that DARPA, the military's
blue-sky research arm, is the agency behind the lofty five-year program,
called
Insight.
The agency's goal is to replace "largely manual
exploitation and
chat-based operator interactions" with a system that mines
different inputs, including drone footage and on-the-ground intelligence,
and quickly stitches together the data to identify potential threats.
What DARPA's calling,
"a next generation
ISR [intelligence surveillance and
reconnaissance] exploitation and resource management system",
...would be faster
than human analysts, but it'd still rely on their input.
DARPA wants an interface that's adaptable,
letting users provide context and pick the best surveillance combo for a
given situation.
The Pentagon's been investing in super-powered surveillance for years now,
and DARPA wants Insight to capitalize on the rapid growth in the recon
field.
The program will incorporate brand new spy cams, like ARGUS-IS, a 1.8 Gigapixel camera that tracks over 100 square miles in real time.
And ongoing DARPA projects might be rolled into
the Insight system too. The agency's solicitation cites a handful, including
the recently-launched PerSEAS, a program to design complex algorithms that
can somehow spot threats based on little more than "weak evidence."
It's the Information Awareness Office by another name.
The Information Awareness Office (IAO)
was established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
in January 2002 to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying
surveillance and information technology to track and monitor terrorists and
other asymmetric threats to national security, by achieving Total
Information Awareness (TIA).
This would be achieved by creating enormous
computer databases to gather and store the personal information of everyone
in the United States, including,
-
personal e-mails
-
social network analysis
-
credit card records
-
phone calls
-
medical records,
...and numerous other
sources, without any requirement for a search warrant.
This information
would then be analyzed to look for suspicious activities, connections
between individuals, and "threats".
Additionally, the program included funding for
biometric surveillance technologies that could identify and track
individuals using surveillance cameras, and other methods.
Their logo says it all:
the
New World Order's pyramid and all seeing Eye.
It is the total tracking, total control, and
total tyranny program.
