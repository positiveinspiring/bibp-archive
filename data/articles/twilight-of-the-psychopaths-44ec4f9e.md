Our society is run by insane people for
insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal
ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing
that. That's what's insane about it.
John Lennon, before his murder by
CIA mind-control subject Mark David Chapman
When Gandhi was asked his opinion of
Western civilization he said it would be a good idea. But that oft-cited
quote, is misleading, assuming as it does that civilization is an
unmitigated blessing.
Civilized people, we are told, live peacefully and cooperatively with their
fellows, sharing the necessary labour in order to obtain the leisure to
develop arts and sciences. And while that would be a good idea, it is not a
good description of what has been going on in the so-called advanced
cultures during the past 8,000 years.
Civilization, as we know it, is largely the creation of psychopaths. All
civilizations, our own included, have been based on slavery and warfare.
Incidentally, the latter term is a euphemism for mass murder.
The prevailing recipe for civilization is simple:
-
Use lies and brainwashing to create an
army of controlled, systematic mass murderers
-
Use that army to enslave large numbers
of people (i.e. seize control of their labour power and its fruits)
-
Use that slave labour power to improve
the brainwashing process (by using the economic surplus to employ
scribes, priests, and PR men). Then go back to step one and repeat
the process.
Psychopaths have played a disproportionate role
in the development of civilization, because they are hard-wired to lie,
kill, injure, and generally inflict great suffering on other humans without
feeling any remorse. The inventor of civilization - the first tribal
chieftain who successfully brainwashed an army of controlled mass
murdererswas almost certainly a genetic psychopath.
Since that momentous discovery, psychopaths have
enjoyed a significant advantage over non-psychopaths in the struggle for
power in civilizational hierarchies - especially military hierarchies.
Military institutions are tailor-made for psychopathic killers. The 5% or so
of human males who feel no remorse about killing their fellow human beings
make the best soldiers. And the 95% who are extremely reluctant to kill make
terrible soldiers - unless they are brainwashed with highly sophisticated
modern techniques that turn them (temporarily it is hoped) into functional
psychopaths.
In
On Killing, Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has re-written military
history, to highlight what other histories hide: The fact that military
science is less about strategy and technology, than about overcoming the
instinctive human reluctance to kill members of our own species.
The true Revolution in Military Affairs was
not Donald Rumsfelds move to high-tech in 2001, but Brigadier Gen.
S.L.A. Marshalls discovery in the 1940s that only 15-20% of World
War II soldiers along the line of fire would use their weapons:
Those (80-85%) who did not fire did not run
or hide (in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue
comrades, get ammunition, or run messages), but they simply would not
fire their weapons at the enemy, even when faced with repeated waves of
banzai charges
(Grossman, p. 4).
Marshalls discovery and subsequent research,
proved that in all previous wars, a tiny minority of soldiers - the 5% who
are natural-born psychopaths, and perhaps a few temporarily-insane
imitatorsdid almost all the killing.
Normal men just went through the
motions and, if at all possible, refused to take the life of an enemy
soldier, even if that meant giving up their own. The implication: Wars are
ritualized mass murders by psychopaths of non-psychopaths. (This cannot be
good for humanitys genetic endowment!)
Marshalls work, brought a Copernican revolution to military science. In the
past, everyone believed that the soldier willing to kill for his country was
the (heroic) norm, while one who refused to fight was a (cowardly)
aberration. The truth, as it turned out, was that the normative soldier
hailed from the psychopathic five percent.
The sane majority, would rather die than fight.
The implication, too frightening for even the likes of Marshall and
Grossman to fully digest, was that the norms for soldiers behavior
in battle had been set by psychopaths. That meant that psychopaths were in
control of the military as an institution.
Worse, it meant that psychopaths
were in control of societys perception of military affairs. Evidently,
psychopaths exercised an enormous amount of power in seemingly sane, normal
society.
How could that be?
In
Political Ponerology, Andrzej
Lobaczewski explains that clinical psychopaths enjoy advantages even in
non-violent competitions to climb the ranks of social hierarchies. Because
they can lie without remorse (and without the telltale physiological stress
that is measured by lie detector tests) psychopaths can always say whatever
is necessary to get what they want.
In court, for example, psychopaths can tell
extreme bald-faced lies in a plausible manner, while their sane opponents
are handicapped by an emotional predisposition to remain within hailing
distance of the truth. Too often, the judge or jury imagines that the truth
must be somewhere in the middle, and then issues decisions that benefit the
psychopath. As with judges and juries, so too with those charged with
decisions concerning who to promote and who not to promote in corporate,
military and governmental hierarchies.
The result is that all hierarchies inevitably
become top-heavy with psychopaths.
So-called conspiracy theorists, some of whom deserve the pejorative
connotation of that much-abused term, often imagine that
secret societies of Jews,
Jesuits,
bankers, communists,
Bilderbergers,
Muslim extremists,
papists, and so on, are secretly:
As
a
leading conspiracy theorist according to
Wikipedia, I feel eminently
qualified to offer an alternative conspiracy theory which, like the
alternative conspiracy theory of 9/11, is both simpler and more accurate
than the prevailing wisdom:
The only conspiracy that matters is the
conspiracy of the psychopaths against the rest of us.
Behind the apparent insanity of contemporary history, is the actual insanity
of psychopaths fighting to preserve their disproportionate power. And as
that power grows ever-more-threatened, the psychopaths grow
ever-more-desperate.
We are witnessing the apotheosis of the overworldthe
criminal syndicate or overlapping set of syndicates that lurks
above ordinary society and law just as the underworld lurks below it.
In
9/11 and the 9/11 wars, we are seeing:
-
the final desperate power-grab or
endgame (Alex Jones)
of brutal, cunning gangs of CIA drug-runners
and President-killers
-
money-laundering international bankers
and their hit-men, economic and otherwise
-
corrupt military contractors and gung-ho
generals
-
corporate predators and their political
enablers
-
brainwashers and mind-rapists
euphemistically known as psy-ops experts and PR specialists
In short, the whole sick crew of certifiable
psychopaths running our so-called civilization.
And they are running scared. It was their terror
of losing control that they projected onto the rest of us by blowing up the
Twin Towers and inciting temporary psychopathic terror-rage in the American
public.
Why does the pathocracy fear it is losing control?
Pathocracy - DISEASE
Because it is threatened by the spread of
knowledge. The greatest fear of any psychopath is of being
found out.
As
George H. W. Bush said to journalist
Sarah McClendon, December 1992,
If the people knew what we had done, they
would chase us down the street and lynch us.
Given that Bush is reported to have participated
in parties where child prostitutes were sodomized and otherwise abused,
among his many other crimes, his statement to McClendon should be taken
seriously.
Psychopaths go through life knowing that they are completely
different from other people. They quickly learn to hide their lack of
empathy, while carefully studying others emotions so as to mimic normalcy
while cold-bloodedly manipulating the normals.
Today, thanks to new information technologies, we are on the brink of
unmasking the psychopaths and building a civilization of, by and for the
normal human being - a civilization without war, a civilization based on
truth, a civilization in which the saintly few rather than the diabolical
few would gravitate to positions of power.
We already have the knowledge necessary to
diagnose psychopathic personalities and keep them out of power. We have the
knowledge necessary to dismantle the institutions in which psychopaths
especially flourish - militaries, intelligence agencies, large corporations,
and secret societies. We simply need to disseminate this knowledge, and the
will to use it, as widely as possible.
Above all, we need to inform the public about how psychopaths co-opt and
corrupt normal human beings. One way they do this, is by manipulating shame
and denial - emotions foreign to psychopaths but common and easily-induced
among normals.
Consider how gangs and secret societies (psychopaths guilds in disguise)
recruit new members. Some criminal gangs and satanist covens demand that
candidates for admission commit a murder to earn their stripes.
Skull and Bones, the Yale-based secret
society that supplies the CIA with drug-runners, mind-rapists, child
abusers and professional killers, requires neophytes to lie naked in a
coffin and masturbate in front of older members while reciting the
candidates entire sexual history.
By forcing the neophyte to engage in ritualized
behavior that would be horrendously shameful in normal society, the
psychopaths guild destroys the candidates normal personality, assuming he
had one in the first place, and turns the individual into a co-opted,
corrupt, degraded shadow of his former self - a manufactured psychopath or
psychopaths apprentice.
This manipulation of shame has the added benefit of making psychopathic
organizations effectively invisible to normal society. Despite easily
available media reports, American voters in 2004 simply refused to see that
the two major-party presidential candidates had lain naked in a coffin
masturbating in front of older Bonesmen in order to gain admission to Skull
and Bones and thus become members of the criminal overworld.
Likewise, many Americans have long refused to
see that hawkish elements of the overworld, operating through the CIA, had
obviously been the murderers of JFK, MLK, RFK, JFK Jr., Malcolm X, Ché,
Allende, Wellstone, Lumumba, Aguilera, Diem, and countless other relatively
non-psychopathic leaders. They refuse to see the continuing murders of
millions of people around the world in what amounts to an American
holocaust.
They refuse to see the evidence that the
psychopaths guilds running Americas most powerful institutions use the
most horrific forms of sexualized abuse imaginable to induce
multiple-personality-disorder in child victims, then use the resulting
mind-control slaves as disposable drug-runners, prostitutes, Manchurian
candidates, and even diplomatic envoys.
And of course they refuse to see that 9/11 was a
transparently obvious inside job, and that their own psychopath-dominated
military-intelligence apparatus is behind almost every major terrorist
outrage of recent decades.
All of this psychopathic behavior at the top of the social hierarchy is
simply too shameful for ordinary people to see, so they avert their gaze,
just as wives of husbands who are sexually abusing their children sometimes
refuse to see what is happening in plain view. If deep, deep denial were a
river in Egypt, American citizens willful blindness would be more like the
Marianas Trench.
But thanks to the power of the Internet, people everywhere are waking up.
The only obvious non-psychopath among Republican presidential candidates,
Ron Paul, also happens to be the only candidate in either party with
significant grassroots support.
If love is embedded in the Revolution Ron Paul heralds, that is
because Dr. Paul - a kindly, soft-spoken physician who has delivered more
than 4,000 babies - implicitly recognizes that government is the invention
and tool of psychopaths, and therefore must be strictly limited in scope and
subjected to a rigorous system of checks and balances, lest the psychopaths
tools, fear and hatred, replace love as the glue that binds society
together.
The decline in militarism since World War II in advanced countries, the
spread of literacy and communications technology, and the peoples growing
demands for a better life, together represent a gathering force that
terrifies the pathocracy, (those alternately
competing-then-cooperating gangs of psychopaths who have ruled through lies,
fear and intimidation since the dawn of so-called civilization).
Since nuclear weapons have made war obsolete, the pathocracy is
terrified that its favorite social control mechanism - ritualized mass slaughter
- is
increasingly unavailable. And if war was the great human tragedy, the pathocrats pathetic attempt at a war-substitute
- the transparently phoney
war on terror
- is repeating it as sheerest farce.
Truly, we are witnessing the twilight of the psychopaths.
Whether in their death throes they succeed in
pulling down the curtain of eternal night on all of us, or whether we resist
them and survive to see the dawn of a civilization worthy of the name, is
the great decision in which all of us others, however humbly, are now
participating.
Insane Nation Dictatorship
USA Hijacked by Psychopathic Criminals
by Eric James Rainbolt
Quality Analyst, Chicago
from
WebArchive Website
Mass insanity and "blissful ignorance" has
become the new "fad" in America as the country is completely overthrown from
the inside out, ever since America's original founding in 1776, for
elite-class plans for endless war and a global dictatorship. The only
revolutionaries who have ever succeeded since 1776 have been the banking and
criminal class, organizing through
secretive societies, principally through
high degree freemasonry, and severely hijacking positions of power across
the full spectrum of the current corrupt government.
Sovereignty and constitutional law has been
dissolved. Entire nations have been turned into corrupt megacorporations. In
short, the cryptocracy's serial pattern over the course of history has been
reversed engineered and cracked; the slightly hidden communication code of "New
World Order" cult society, about 3 years ago, in November of
2004.
The Cryptocracy book is the revised
version of my original expose of this
The Freemasonic Architecture of History
(May 2005).
This particular discovery most succinctly and
accurately solves, by tying the many staged events together through the
noted serial pattern, the long string of megacrimes in world history over
the past century:
from "who" was behind staging WW I
that ended on 11/11/1918 at 11am, to JFK on 11/22/1963, to 911
in 2001, to STS 107 Columbia on 2/1/2003, to 311 Madrid and to
London 7/7/2005, to today - before the next staged megacrime by the
cryptocracy, which appears to be a global pandemic influenza plague
by the trail of evidence left behind since an 11:30am meeting by the
UN/WHO on 11/11/2004.
Here is the
shorter press release. The above
should be good for a long time. There is no copyright, especially on matters
of truth and import such as this.
In short, I don't feel reality should be
copyrighted.
I am retiring from being a one-man-band about
this discovery over here though; not performing radio interviews, etc.
"The American people still have an open
internet before it becomes increasingly censored and overly monitored.
It is now 'their responsibility' to learn how to educate themselves and
help inform and educate others to this global megaproblem - just keep
in mind that all roads lead back to the House of
Rothschild and
Rockefeller."
The Cryptocracy Book (Top
UN-Secret - by Eric James Rainbolt) accurately and
comprehensively exposes and accurately proves the existence and maximally
huge significance of the megaproblem.
Yours in the spirit of truth, sanity, and true
justice,
