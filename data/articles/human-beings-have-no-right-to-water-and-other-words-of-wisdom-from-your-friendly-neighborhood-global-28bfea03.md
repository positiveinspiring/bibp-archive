Peter Brabeck
Chairman of
Nestlé
In the 2005 documentary,
We Feed the World,
then-CEO
of Nestlé, the worlds largest foodstuff corporation, Peter
Brabeck-Letmathe, shared some of his own views and wisdom about the
world and humanity.
Brabeck believes that nature is not "good," that
there is nothing to worry about with GMO foods, that profits matter above
all else, that people should work more, and that human beings do not have a
right to water.
Today, he explained,
"people believe that everything that comes
from Nature is good," marking a large change in perception, as
previously, "we always learnt that Nature could be pitiless."
Humanity, Brabeck stated,
"is now in the position of being able to
provide some balance to Nature, but in spite of this we have something
approaching a shibboleth that everything that comes from Nature is
good."
He then referenced the "organic movement" as an
example of this thinking, premising that "organic is best." But rest
assured, he corrected, "organic is not best."
In 15 years
of GMO food consumption in the United
States,
"not one single case of illness has
occurred."
In spite of this, he noted, "were all so uneasy
about it in Europe, that something might happen to us."
This view, according to Brabeck, is "hypocrisy
more than anything else." (below video)
Water, Brabeck correctly pointed out,
"is of course the most important raw
material we have today in the world," but added: "Its a question of
whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population.
And there are two different opinions on the matter. The one opinion,
which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about
declaring water a public right."
Brabeck elaborated on this "extreme" view:
"That means that as a human being you should
have a right to water.
Thats an extreme
solution." (below video)
The other view, and thus, the "less extreme"
view, he explained,
"says that water is a foodstuff like any
other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value.
Personally I believe its better to give a foodstuff a value so that
were all aware that it has its price, and then that one should take
specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to
this water, and there are many different possibilities there."
The biggest social responsibility of any CEO,
Brabeck explained:
is to maintain and ensure the successful and
profitable future of his enterprise. For only if we can ensure our
continued, long term existence will we be in the position to actively
participate in the solution of the problems that exist in the world.
Were in the position of being able to
create jobs
If you want to create work, you have to work
yourself, not as it was in the past where existing work was distributed.
If you remember the main argument for the 35-hour week was that there
was a certain amount of work and it would be better if we worked less
and distributed the work amongst more people.
That has proved quite clearly to be 'wrong.'
If you want to create more work you have to
work more yourself. And with that weve got to create a positive image
of the world for people, and I see absolutely no reason why we shouldnt
be positive about the future. Weve never had it so good, weve never
had so much money, weve never been so healthy, weve never lived as
long as we do today.
We have everything we want and we still go
around as if we were in mourning for something.
While watching a promotional video of a Nestlé
factory in Japan, Brabeck commented,
"You can see how modern these factories are;
highly robotized,
almost no people." (below video)
And of course, for someone claiming to be
interested in creating jobs, there appears to be no glaring hypocrisy in
praising factories with "almost no people."
Its important to note that this is not simply
the personal view of some random corporate executive, but rather, that it
reflects an institutional reality of corporations: the primary objective of
a corporation - above all else - is to maximize short-term profits for
shareholders.
By definition, then, workers should work more
and be paid less, the environment is only a concern so much as corporations
have unhindered access to control and exploit the resources of the
environment, and ultimately, its good to replace workers with automation
and robotics so that you dont have to pay fewer or any workers, and thus,
maximize profits.
With this institutional - and ideological -
structure (which was legally constructed by the state), concern for the
environment, for water, for the world and for humanity can only be promoted
if it can be used to advance corporate profits, or if it can be used for
public relations purposes. Ultimately, it has to be hypocritical.
A corporate executive cannot take an earnest
concern in promoting the general welfare of the world, the environment, or
humanity, because that it not the institutional function of a corporation,
and no CEO that did such would be allowed to remain as CEO.
This is why it matters what Peter Brabeck
thinks:
he represents the type of individual - and the type of thinking -
that is a product of and a requirement for running a successful
multinational corporation, of the corporate culture itself.
To the average person viewing his interview, it
might come across as some sort of absurd tirade youd expect from a
Nightline interview with some infamous serial killer, if that killer had
been put in charge of a multinational corporation:
People have a right to water? What an
absurd notion! Next thing youll say is that child labour is bad,
polluting the environment is bad, or that people have some sort of
right to
life! Imagine the audacity!
All that matters is profits, and what a
wonderful thing it would be to have less people and more profits! Water
isnt a right, its only a necessity, so naturally, it makes sense to
privatize it so that large multinational corporations like Nestlé can
own the worlds water and ensure that only those who can pay can drink.
Problem solved!
Sadly, though intentionally satirical, this is
the essential view of Brabeck and others like him.
And disturbingly, Brabecks influence is not
confined to the board of Nestlé. Brabeck became the CEO of Nestlé in 1997, a
position he served until 2008, at which time he resigned as CEO but remained
as chairman of the board of directors of Nestlé.
Apart from Nestlé,
Brabeck serves as vice chairman of the board of directors of LOréal,
the worlds largest cosmetics and beauty company; vice chairman of the
board of Credit Suisse Group, one of the worlds largest banks; and is a
member of the board of directors of Exxon Mobil, one of the worlds largest
oil and energy conglomerates.
He was also a former board member of one of the
worlds largest pharmaceutical conglomerates,
Roche.
Brabeck also serves as a member of the
Foundation Board for the World Economic Forum (WEF),
"the
guardian of [the WEFs] mission, values and brand
responsible for
inspiring business and public confidence through an exemplary standard
of governance."
Brabeck is also a member of the
European Round Table of Industrialists
(ERT), a group of European corporate CEOs which directly advise and help
steer policy for the European Union and its member countries.
He has
also attended meetings of
the
Bilderberg Group, an annual forum of 130 corporate, banking, media,
political and military elites from Western Europe and North America.
Thus, through his multiple board memberships on
some of the largest corporations on earth, as well as his leadership and
participation in some of the leading international think tanks, forums and
business associations, Brabeck has unhindered access to political and other
elites around the world.
When he speaks, powerful people listen.
Brabecks Brain
Brabeck has become an influential voice on
issues of food and water, and not surprisingly so, considering he is
chairman of the largest food service corporation on earth.
Brabecks career goes back to when he was
working for Nestlé in Chile in the early 1970s, when the left-leaning
democratically-elected president Salvador Allende
was,
"threatening to nationalize milk production,
and
Nestlés Chilean operations along with it."
A 1973 Chilean military coup - with the support
of the CIA - put an end to that "threat" by bringing in the military
dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who murdered thousands of Chileans and
established a national security state, imposing harsh economic measures to
promote the interests of elite corporate and financial interests (what later
became known as neoliberalism).
In a 2009 article for Foreign Policy magazine, Brabeck
declared:
"Water
is the new gold, and a few savvy countries and companies are already
banking on it."
In a 2010 article for the
Guardian, Brabeck wrote that,
"[w]hile our collective attention has been
focused on depleting supplies of fossil fuels, we have been largely
ignoring the simple fact that, unless radical changes are made, we will
run out of water first, and soon."
What the world needs, according to Brabeck, is,
"to set a price that more accurately values
our most precious commodity," and that, "[t]he era of water at throwaway
prices is coming to an end."
In other words, water should become increasingly
expensive, according to Brabeck.
Countries, he wrote, should recognize,
"that not all water use should be regarded
as equal."
In a discussion with the Wall Street Journal in
2011, Brabeck spoke against the use of biofuels - converting food into fuel
- and suggested that this was the primary cause of increased food prices
(though in reality, food price increases are primarily the result of
speculation by major banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase).
Brabeck noted the relationship between his
business - food - and major geopolitical issues, stating:
"What we call today the Arab Spring
really
started as a protest against ever-increasing food prices."
One "solution," he suggested, was to provide a
"market" for water as "the best guidance that you can have."
If water was a market product, it wouldnt be
wasted on growing food for fuel, but focus on food for consumption - and
preferably (in his view), genetically modified foods.
After all, he said,
"if the market forces are there the
investments are going to be made."
Brabeck suggested that the world could "feed
nine billion people," providing them with water and fuel, but only
on the
condition that,
"we
let the market do its thing."
Brabeck co-authored a 2011 article for the
Wall Street Journal in which he stated that in order to provide,
"universal access to clean water, there is
simply no other choice but to price water at a reasonable rate," and
that roughly 1.8 billion people on earth lack access to clean drinking
water "because of poor water management and governance practices, and
the lack of political will."
Brabecks job then, as chairman of Nestlé, is to
help create the "political will" to make water into a modern "market"
product.
Now before praising Brabeck for his
enlightened activism on the issue of water scarcity and providing the
worlds poor with access to clean drinking water (which are very real and
urgent issues needing attention), Brabeck himself has stressed that his
interest in the issue of water has nothing to do with actually addressing
these issues in a meaningful way, or for the benefit of the earth and
humanity.
No, his motivation is much more simple than
this.
In a 2010 interview for
BigThink, Brabeck
noted:
"If Nestlé and myself have become very vocal
in the area of water, it was not because of any philanthropic idea, it
was very simple: by analyzing
what is the single most important factor
for the sustainability of Nestlé, water came as [the] number one
subject."
This is what led Brabeck and Nestlé into the
issue of water "sustainability," he explained.
"I think this is part of a companys
responsibility," and added: "Now, if I was in a different industry, I
would have a different subject, certainly, that I would be focusing on."
Brabeck was asked if industries should,
"have a role in finding solutions to
environmental issues that affect their business," to which he replied:
"Yes, because it is in the interest of
our shareholders
If I want to convince my shareholders that this
industry is a long-term sustainable industry, I have to ensure that
all aspects that are vital for this company are sustainable
When I see, like in our case, that one
of the aspects - which is water, which is needed in order to produce
the raw materials for our company - if this is not sustainable, then
my enterprise is not sustainable.
So therefore
I have to do
something about it (below video). So shareholder interest and societal
interest are common."
Thus, when Brabeck and Nestlé promote "water
sustainability," what they are really promoting is the sustainability of
Nestlés access to and control over water resources. How is that best
achieved?
Well, since Nestlé is a large multinational
corporation, the natural solution is to promote market control of water,
which means privatization and monopolization of the worlds water supply
into a few corporate hands.
In a 2011 conversation with the editor of Time
Magazine at the
Council on Foreign Relations, Brabeck referred to a recent World
Economic Forum meeting where the issue of "corporate social responsibility"
was the main subject of discussion, when corporate executives "started to
talk about [how] we have to give back to society," Brabeck spoke up and
stated:
"I dont feel that we have to give back to
society, because we have not been stealing from society."
Brabeck explained to the Council on Foreign
Relations that he felt such a concept was the purview of philanthropy, and,
"this was a problem for the CEO of any
public company, because I personally believe that no CEO of a public
company should be allowed to make philanthropy
I think anybody who does
philanthropy should do it with his own money and not the money of the
shareholders."
Engaging in corporate social responsibility,
Brabeck explained, "was an additional cost."
At the 2008 World Economic Forum, a consortium
of corporations and international organizations formed the
2030 Water Resources Group, chaired by Peter Brabeck.
It was established in order to "shape the
agenda" for the discussion of water resources, and to create "new models for
collaboration" between public and private enterprises.
The governing council of the 2030 WRG is chaired
by Brabeck and includes,
-
the executive vice president and CEO of
the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
-
the investment arm of the World Bank
-
the administrator of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP)
-
the chief business officer and managing
director of the World Economic Forum
-
the president of the African Development
Bank
-
the chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola
Company
-
the president of the Asian Development
Bank
-
the director-general of the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF)
-
the president of the Inter-American
Development Bank
-
the chairman and CEO of PepsiCo,
...among others.
At the World Water Forum in 2012 - an event
largely attended by the global proponents of water privatization, Nestlé
among their most enthusiastic supporters - Brabeck suggested that the 2030
Water Resources Group represents a "global
public-private initiative" which could help in,
"providing tools and information on best
practice" as well as "guidance and new policy ideas on water resource
scarcity."
Brabeck and Nestlé had been in talks with the
Canadian provincial government of Alberta in planning for a potential "water
exchange," to - in the words of Macleans magazine - "turn
water into money."
In 2012, the University of Alberta bestowed an
honorary degree upon Peter Brabeck,
"for his work as a responsible steward for
water around the world."
Protests were organized at the university to
oppose the honor, with a representative from the public interest group,
the Council of Canadians, noting:
"Im afraid that the university is
positioning themselves on the side of the commodifiers, the people who
want to say that water is not a human right that everyone has the right
to, but is just a product that can be bought and sold."
A professor at the university stated:
"Im ashamed at this point, about what the
university is doing and Im also very concerned about the way the
president of the university has been demonizing people who oppose this."
As another U of A professor
stated:
"What Nestlé does is take what clean water
there is in which poor people are relying on, bottle it and then sell it
to wealthier people at
an exorbitant profit."
The Global Water
Privatization Agenda
Water privatization is an extremely vicious
operation, where the quality of - and access to - water resources diminishes
or even vanishes, while the costs explode.
When it comes to the privatization of water,
there is no such thing as "competition" in how the word is generally
interpreted: there are only a handful of global corporations that undertake
massive water privatizations. The two most prominent are the French-based
Suez Environment and Veolia Environment, but also include Thames Water,
Nestlé, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, among others.
For a world in which food has already been
turned into a "market commodity" and has been "financialized," leading to
massive food price increases, hunger riots, and immense profits for a few
corporations and banks, the prospect of water privatization is even more
disturbing.
The agenda of water privatization is organized
at the international level, largely promoted through the World Water Forum
and the World Water Council.
The World Water Council (WWC) was established in
1996 as a French-based non-profit organization with over 400 members from
intergovernmental organizations, government agencies, corporations,
corporate-dominated NGOs and environmental organizations, water companies,
international organizations and academic institutions.
Every three years, the WWC hosts a World Water
Forum, the first of which took place in 1997, and the 6th
conference in 2012 was attended by thousands of participants from countries
and institutions all over the world get together to decide the future of
water, and of course, promote the privatization of this essential resource
to human life.
The 6th World Water Forum, hosted in
Marseilles, France, was primarily sponsored by the French government and the
World Water Council, but included a number of other contributors, including:
-
the African Development Bank
-
African Union Commission
-
Arab Water Council
-
Asian Development Bank
-
the Council of Europe
-
the European Commission
-
the European Investment Bank
-
the European Parliament
-
the European Water Association
-
the Food and Agricultural Organization
-
the Global Environment Facility
-
Inter-American Development Bank
-
Nature Conservancy
-
Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD)
-
Organization of American States (OAS)
-
Oxfam
-
the World Bank
-
the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development
-
the World Health Organization
-
the World Wildlife Fund,
...and a number of corporate sponsors,
including:
-
RioTinto Alcan
-
EDF
-
Suez Environment
-
Veolia
-
HSBC
Clearly, they have human and environmental
interests at heart.
The World Bank is a major promoter of water
privatization, as much of its aid to developing countries was earmarked
for water privatization schemes which inevitably benefit major corporations,
in co-operation with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the U.S.
Treasury.
One of the first major water privatization
schemed funded by the World Bank was in Argentina, for which the Bank
"advised" the government of Argentina in 1991 on the bidding and contracting
of the water concession, setting a model for what would be promoted around
the world.
The World Banks investment arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), loaned roughly $1 billion to the
Argentine government for three water and sewage projects in the country, and
even bought a 5% stake in the concession, thus becoming a part owner.
When the concession for Buenos Aires was opened
up, the French sent representatives from Veolia and Suez, which formed the
consortium Aguas Argentinas, and of course, the costs for water services
went up.
Between 1993, when the contract with the French
companies was signed, and 1997, the Aguas Argentinas consortium gained more
influence with Argentine President Carlos Menem and his Economy Minister
Domingo Cavallo, who would hold meetings with the president of Suez as well
as the President of France, Jacques Chirac.
By 2002, the water rates (cost of water) in
Buenos Aires had
increased by
177% since the beginning of the concession.
In the 1990s, the amount of World Bank water
privatization projects increased ten-fold, with 31% of World Bank water
supply and sanitation projects between 1990 and 2001 including conditions of
private-sector involvement, despite the fact that the projects
consistently
failed in terms of providing cheaper and better water to larger areas.
But of course, they were highly profitable for
large corporations, so naturally, they continued to be promoted and
supported (and subsidized).
One of the most notable examples of water
privatization schemes
was in Bolivia, the poorest country in South America.
In 1998, an IMF loan to Bolivia demanded
conditions of "structural reform," the selling off of "all remaining public
enterprises," including water. In 1999, the World Bank told the Bolivian
government to end its subsidies for water services, and that same year, the
government leased the Cochabamba Water System to a consortium of
multinational corporations,
Aguas del Tunari, which included the
American corporation
Bechtel.
After granting the consortium a 40-year lease,
the government passed a law which would make residents pay the full cost of
water services. In January of 2000, protests in Cochabamba shut down the
city for four days, striking and establishing roadblocks, mobilizing against
the water price increases which doubled or tripled their water bills.
Protests continued in February, met with riot
police and tear gas,
injuring 175 people.
By April, the protests began to spread to other
Bolivian cities and rural communities, and during a "state of siege"
(essentially martial law) declared by Bolivian president Hugo Banzer,
a 17-year old boy, Victor Hugo Daza, was shot and killed by a Bolivian Army
captain, who was trained as the U.S. military academy, the School of the
Americas.
As riot police continued to meet protesters with
tear gas and live ammunition, more people were killed, and dozens more
injured.
On
April 10, the government conceded to the people, ending the contract
with the corporate consortium and granting the people to control their water
system through a grassroots coalition led by the protest organizers.
Two days later, World Bank President James Wolfensohn stated that the people of Bolivia should pay for their water
services. On August 6, 2001, the president of Bolivia resigned, and the Vice
President Jorge Quiroga, a former IBM executive, was sworn in as the
new president to serve the remainder of the term until August of 2002.
Meanwhile, the water consortium, deeply offended
at the prospect of people taking control of their own resources, attempted
to take legal action against the government of Bolivia for violating the
contract.
Bechtel was
seeking $25 million in compensation for its "losses," while recording a
yearly profit of $14 billion, whereas the national budget of Bolivia was a
mere $2.7 billion.
The situation ultimately led to a type of social
revolution which brought to power the first indigenous Bolivian leader in
the countrys history, Evo Morales.
This, of course, has not stopped
the World Bank
and IMF - and the imperial governments which finance them - from promoting
water privatization around the world for the exclusive benefit of a handful
of multinational corporations. The World Bank promotes water privatization
across Africa in order to "ease
the continents water crisis," by making water more expensive and less
accessible.
As the communications director of the World Bank
in 2003, Paul Mitchell, explained,
"Water is crucial to life - we have to get
water to poor people," adding: "There are a lot of myths about
privatization."
I would agree.
Though the myth that it works is what I would
propose, but Mitchell instead suggested that,
"[p]rivate sector participation is simply to
manage the asset to make it function for the people in the country."
Except that it doesnt...
But dont worry, decreasing water standards,
dismantling water distribution, and rapidly increasing the costs of water to
the poorest regions on earth is good, according to Mitchell and the World
Bank. He told the BBC that what the World Bank is most interested in is the
"best way to get
water to poor people."
Perhaps he misspoke and meant to say,
"the best way to take water from poor
people," because thats what actually happens.
In 2003, the World Bank funded a water
privatization scheme in the country of Tanzania, supported by the British
government, and granting the concession to a consortium called City Water,
owned by the British company Biwater, which worked with a German engineering
firm, Gauff, to provide water to the city of Dar es Salaam and the
surrounding region.
It was one of the most ambitious water
privatization schemes in Africa, with $140 million in World Bank funding,
and, wrote John Vidal in the
Guardian,
it,
"was intended to be a model for how the
worlds poorest communities could be lifted out of poverty."
The agreement included conditions for the
consortium to install new pipelines for water distribution.
The British governments Department for
International Development gave a 440,000-pound contract to the British
neoliberal think tank, Adam Smith International, "to do public-relations
work for the project."
Tanzanias best-known gospel singer was hired to
perform a pop song about the benefits of privatization, mentioning
electricity, telephones, the ports, railways, and of course, water.
Both the
IMF and World Bank made the water scheme a condition for "aid" they gave to
the country.
Less than one year into the ten-year contract, the private
consortium, City Water, stopped paying its monthly fee for leasing the
governments pipes and infrastructure provided by the public water company, Dawasa, while simultaneously insisting that its own fees be raised.
An unpublished World Bank report even noted:
"The primary assumption on the part of
almost all involved, particularly on the donor side, was that it would
be very hard, if not impossible, for the private operator [City Water]
to perform worse than Dawasa. But that is what happened."
The World Bank as a whole, however, endorsed the
program as "highly
satisfactory," and rightly so, because it was doing what it was intended
to do: provide profits for private corporations at the expense of poor
people.
By 2005, the company had not built any new
pipes, it had not spent the meager investments it promised, and the water
quality declined.
As British government "aid" money was poured
into privatization propaganda, a video was produced which included the
phrase:
"Our old industries are dry like crops and
privatization brings the rain."
Actually, privatization attaches a price-tag to
rain.
Thus, in 2005, the government of Tanzania ended
the contract with City Water, and arrested the three company executives,
deporting them back to Britain. As is typical, the British company, Biwater,
then began to file a lawsuit against the Tanzanian government for breach of
contract, wanting to collect $20-25 million.
A press release from Biwater at the time
wrote:
"We
have been left with no choice
If a signal goes out that governments
are free to expropriate foreign investments with impunity," investors
would flee, and this would, of course, "deal a massive blow to the
development goals of Tanzania and other countries in Africa."
The sixth World Water Forum in Marseilles in
2012 brought together some 19,000 participants, where the French Development
Minister Henri de Raincourt proposed a,
"global water and environment management
scheme," adding: "The French government is not alone in its conviction
that a global environment agency is needed more than ever."
A parallel conference was held - the Alternative
World Water Forum - which featured critics of water privatization.
Gustave Massiah, a representative of the
anti-globalization group Attac, stated,
"Should a global water fund be in control,
giving concessions to multinational companies, then thats not a
solution for us. On the contrary, that would only
add to the
problems of the current system."
Another member of Attac, Jacques Cambon,
used to be the head of SAFEGEs Africa branch, a subsidiary of the water
conglomerate Suez.
Cambon was critical of the idea of a global
water fund, warning against centralization, and further explained that the
World Bank,
"has almost always financed large-scale
projects that were not in tune with local conditions."
Maria Theresa Lauron, a Philippine activist,
shared the story of water privatization in the Philippines,
saying,
"Since 1997, prices went up by 450 to 800
percent
At the same time, the water quality has gone down. Many people
get ill because of bad water; a year ago some 600 people died as a
result of bacteria in the water because
the
private company didnt do proper water checks."
But then, why would the company do such a thing?
Its not like its particularly profitable to be concerned with human
welfare.
In Europe, the European Commission had been
pushing water privatization as a condition for development funds between
2002 and 2010, specifically in several central and eastern European
countries which were dependent upon EU grants.
Since the European debt crisis, the European
Commission had
made water privatization a condition for,
-
Greece - Greece is privatizing its water
companies
-
Portugal - Portugal is being pressured
to sell its national water company, Aguas do Portugal
-
Italy - in Italy, the European Central
Bank (ECB) and the Commission were pushing water privatization, even
though a national referendum in July of 2011 saw the people of Italy
reject such a scheme by 95%
In this context, among the global institutions
and corporations of power and influence, it is perhaps less surprising to
imagine the chairman of Nestlé suggesting that human beings having a "right"
to water is rather "extreme."
And for a very simple reason: thats not
profitable for Nestlé, even though it might be good for humanity and the
earth.
Its about priorities, and in our world,
priorities are set by multinational corporations, banks, and global
oligarchs. As Nestlé would have us think, corporate and social interests are
not opposed, as corporations - through their enlightened self-interest and
profit-seeking motives - will almost accidentally make the world a better
place.
Now, while neoliberal orthodoxy functions on the
basis of people simply accepting this premise without investigation (like
any religious belief), perhaps it would be worth looking at Nestlé as an
example for corporate benefaction for the world and humanity.
Nestlés Corporate Social
Responsibility
Making the World Safe for Nestlé
and Incidentally
Destroying the World
As a major multinational corporation, Nestlé has
a proven track record of,
-
exploiting labour
-
destroying the environment
-
engaging in human rights violations
-
and most importantly -
it makes big profits
In 2012, Nestlé was taking in major profits from
emerging
markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
However, some emerging
market profits began to
slow down in 2013. This was partly the result of
a horsemeat scandal which required companies like Nestlé to intensify
the screening of their food products.
Less than a year prior, Nestlé was complaining
that "over-regulation"
of the food industry was "undermining individual responsibility," which is
another way of saying that responsibility for products and their safety
should be passed from the producer to the consumer.
In other words, if youre stupid enough to buy
Nestlé products, its your fault if you get diabetes or eat horsemeat, and
therefore, its your responsibility, not the responsibility of Nestlé. Fair
enough!
Were stupid enough to accept corporations
ruling over us, therefore, what right do we have to complain about all the
horrendous crimes and destruction they cause? A cynic could perhaps argue
such a point.
One of Nestlés most famous PR problems was that
of marketing artificial baby milk, which sprung to headlines in the 1970s
following the publication of "The Baby Killer," accusing the company of
getting Third World mothers hooked on formula.
As research was proving that breastfeeding was
healthier, Nestlé marketed its baby formula as a way for women to
Westernize and join the modern world, handing out pamphlets and
promotional samples, with companies hiring "sales girls in nurses uniforms
(sometimes qualified, sometimes not)" in order to drop by homes and sell
formula.
Women tried to save money on the formula by
diluting it, often times with contaminated water.
As the London-based organization
War on Want
noted:
"The results can be seen in the clinics and
hospitals, the slums and graveyards of the Third World
Children whose
bodies have wasted away until all that is left is a big head on top of
the shriveled body of an old man."
An official with the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID)
blamed baby formula for,
"a
million infant deaths every year through malnutrition and diarrheal
diseases."
Mike Muller, the author of "The Baby
Killer" back in 1974,
wrote an article for the Guardian in 2013 in which he
mentioned that he gave Peter Brabeck a "present" at the World Economic
Forum,
a signed copy of the report.
The report had sparked a global boycott of
Nestlé and the company responded with lawsuits.
Nestlé has also been implicated for its support
of palm-oil plantations, which have led to increased deforestation and the
destruction of orangutan habitats in Indonesia.
A Greenpeace publication
noted that,
"at least
1500 orangutans died in 2006 as a result of deliberate attacks by
plantation workers and loss of habitat due to the expansion of oil palm
plantations."
A
social media campaign was launched against Nestlé for its role in
supporting palm oil plantations, deforestation, and the destruction of
orangutan habitats and lives.
The campaign pressured Nestlé to decrease its "deforestation
footprint."
As Nestlé has been expanding its presence
in Africa, it has also aroused more controversy in its operations on the
continent. Nestlé purchases one-tenth of the worlds cocoa, most of which
comes from the Ivory Coast, where the company has been implicated in the use
of child labour.
In 2001, U.S. legislation required companies to engage in
"self-regulation" which called for "slave free" labeling on all cocoa
products.
This "self regulation," however, "failed to
deliver" - imagine that! - as one study carried out by Tulane University
with funding from the U.S. government revealed that roughly
2 million children were working on cocoa-related activities in both
Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
Even an internal audit carried out by the
company found that Nestlé was guilty of "numerous"
violations of child labour laws.
Nestlés head of operations stated,
"The use of child labor in our cocoa supply
goes against everything we stand for."
So naturally, they will continue to use child
labour.
Peter Brabeck stated that its "nearly
impossible" to end the practice, and he compared the practice to that of
farming in Switzerland:
"You go to Switzerland
still today, in the
month of September, schools have one week holiday so students can help
in the wine harvesting
In those developing countries, this also
happens," he told the Council on Foreign Relations.
While acknowledging that this,
"is basically child labor and slave labor in
some African markets," it is "a challenge which is not very easy to
tackle," noting that there is "a very fine edge" of what is acceptable
regarding "child labor in [the] agricultural environment."
He
added:
"Its
almost natural."
Thus, Brabeck explained,
"you have to look at it differently," and
that it was not the job of Nestlé to tell parents that their children
cant work on cocoa plantations/farms, "which is ridiculous," he
suggested: "But what we are saying is we will help you that your child
has access for schooling."
So clearly there is no problem with using child
slavery, just so long as the children get some schooling
presumably, in
their off-hours from slavery.
Problem solved!
While Brabeck and Nestlé have made a big issue
of water scarcity, which again, is an incredibly important issue, their
solutions revolve around "pricing" water at a market value, and thus
encouraging privatization.
Indeed, a global water grab has been a defining
feature of the past several years (coupled with a great global land grab),
in which investors, countries, banks and corporations have been buying up
vast tracts of land (primarily in sub-Saharan Africa) for virtually nothing,
pushing off the populations which live off the land, taking all the
resources, water, and clearing the land of towns and villages, to convert
them into industrial agricultural plantations to develop food and other
crops for export, while domestic populations are pushed deeper into poverty,
hunger, and are deprived of access to water.
Peter Brabeck has referred to the land grabs
as
really being about water:
"For with the land comes the right to
withdraw the water linked to it, in most countries essentially a freebie
that increasingly could be seen as the most valuable part of the deal."
This, noted Brabeck, is "the
great water grab."
And of course, Nestlé would know something about
water grabs, as it has become very good at implementing them. In past years,
the company has been increasingly buying land where it is taking the fresh
water resources, bottling them in plastic bottles and selling them to the
public at exorbitant prices.
In 2008, as Nestlé was planning to build a
bottling water plant in McCloud, California, the Attorney General
opposed
the plan, noting:
"It takes
massive quantities of oil to produce plastic water bottles and to
ship them in diesel trucks across the United States
Nestlé will face swift legal challenge if it
does not fully evaluate the environmental impact of diverting millions
of gallons of spring water from the McCloud River into billions of
plastic water bottles."
Nestlé already operated roughly 50 springs
across the country, and was acquiring more, such as a plan to draw roughly
65 million gallons of water from a spring in Colorado, despite
fierce
opposition to the deal.
Years of opposition to the plans of Nestlé in
McCloud finally resulted in the company giving up on its efforts there.
However, the company quickly moved on to finding new locations to take water
and make a profit while destroying the environment (just an added bonus, of
course).
The corporation controls one-third of the U.S.
market in bottled water, selling it as 70 different brand names, including,
-
Perrier
-
Arrowhead
-
Deer Park
-
Poland Spring
The two other large bottled water companies are
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, though Nestlé had
earned a reputation,
"in
targeting rural communities for spring water, a move that has earned
it fierce opposition across the U.S. from towns worried about losing
their precious water resources."
And water grabs by Nestlé as well as opposition
continue to engulf towns and states and cities across the country, with one
more recent case
in Oregon.
Nestlé has
aroused controversy for
its relations with labour, exploiting farmers, pollution, and human rights
violations, among
many other things.
Nestlé has been implicated in the kidnapping and
murder of a union activist and employee of the companys subsidiary in
Colombia, with a judge demanding the prosecutor to,
"investigate leading managers of Nestle-Cicolac
to clarify
their likely involvement and/or planning of the murder of union
leader Luciano Enrique Romero Molina."
In 2012, a Colombian trade union and a human
rights group
filed charges against Nestlé for negligence over the murder of their
former employee Romero.
More recently, Nestlé has been found liable over
spying on NGOs, with the company hiring a private security company to
infiltrate an anti-globalization group, and while a judge ordered the
company to pay compensation, a Nestlé spokesperson stated that,
"incitement to infiltration is against
Nestlés corporate business principles."
Just like child slavery, presumably.
But not to worry, the spokesman said,
"we will take
appropriate action."
Peter Brabeck, who it should be noted, also sits
on the boards of,
...warned
in 2009 that the global economic crisis would be "very deep" and that,
"this
crisis will go on for a long period."
On top of that, the food crisis would be
"getting worse" over time, hitting poor people the hardest.
However,
propping up the financial sector through massive bailouts was, in his view,
"absolutely
essential."
But not to worry, as banks are bailed out by
governments, who hand the bill to the population, which pays for the crisis
through reduced standards of living and exploitation (which we call
"austerity" and "structural reform" measures), Nestlé has been able
to adapt to a new market of impoverished people, selling cheaper
products to more people who now have less money.
And better yet, its been
making
massive profits...
And remember, according to Brabeck, isnt that
all that really matters? This is the world according to corporations.
Unfortunately, while it creates enormous wealth, it is also leading to the
inevitable extinction of our species, and possibly all life on earth. But
thats not a concern of corporations, so it doesnt concern those who run
corporations, who make the 'important decisions', and pressure and purchase
our politicians.
I wonder
what would the world be like if people
were able to make decisions?
Theres only
one way to know...
