Dr.
Henry
Kissinger, who wrote:
"Depopulation should be the highest priority
of U.S. foreign policy towards the Third World."
Research on population control, preventing
future births, is now being carried out secretly by biotech companies.
Dr. Ignacio Chapela, a University of
California microbiologist, discovered that wild corn in remote parts of
Mexico is contaminated with lab altered DNA. That discovery made him a
threat to the biotech industry.
Chapela was denied tenure at UC Berkeley when he reported this to the
scientific community, despite the embarrassing discovery that UC Chancellor
Berdahl, who was denying him tenure, was getting large cash payments -
$40,000 per year - from the LAM Research Corp. in Plano, Texas.
Berdahl served as president of Texas A&M University before coming to
Berkeley. During a presentation about his case, Chapela revealed that a
spermicidal corn developed by a U.S. company is now being tested in Mexico.
Males who unknowingly eat the corn produce non-viable sperm and are unable
to reproduce.
Depopulation, also known as eugenics, is quite another thing and was
proposed under the Nazis during World War II. It is the deliberate killing
off of large segments of living populations and was proposed for Third World
countries under President Carter's administration by the National Security
Council's Ad Hoc Group on Population Policy.
National Security Memo 200, dated April 24, 1974, and titled "Implications
of world wide population growth for U.S. security & overseas interests,"
says:
"Dr. Henry Kissinger proposed in his memorandum
to the NSC that, depopulation should be the highest priority
of U.S. foreign policy towards the Third World."
He quoted reasons of national security, and
because,
'(t)he U.S. economy will require large and
increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from
less-developed countries... Wherever a lessening of population can
increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes
relevant to resources, supplies and to the economic interests of U.S.'"
Depopulation policy became the top priority
under,
-
the NSC agenda
-
Club of Rome
-
U.S. policymakers like,
-
Gen. Alexander Haig
-
Cyrus Vance
-
Ed Muskie
-
Kissinger
According to an NSC spokesman at the time, the
United States shared the view of former World Bank President Robert McNamara
that the "population crisis" is a greater threat to U.S. national security
interests than nuclear annihilation.
In 1975, Henry Kissinger established a
policy-planning group in the U.S. State Department's Office of Population
Affairs. The depopulation "GLOBAL 2000" document for President Jimmy Carter
was prepared.
It is no surprise that this policy was established under President Carter
with help from Kissinger and Brzezinski - all with ties to David
Rockefeller.
The Bush family, the Harriman family - the Wall
Street business partners of Bush in financing Hitler - and the Rockefeller
family are the elite of the American eugenics movement.
Even Prince
Philip of Britain,
a member of the
Bilderberg Group, is in favor of depopulation:
"If I were reincarnated I would wish to be
returned to earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels"
(Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh, leader
of the World Wildlife Fund, quoted in "Are You Ready for Our New Age
Future?" Insiders Report, American Policy Center, December 1995).
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has
been proposing, funding and building Bio-Weapons Level 3 and Level 4 labs at
many places around the U.S. even on university campuses and in densely
populated urban locations.
In a
Bio-Weapons Level 4 facility, a single
bacteria or virus is lethal. Bio-Weapons Level 4 is the highest level
legally allowed in the continental U.S.
For what purpose are these labs being developed, and who will make the
decisions on where bio-weapons created in these facilities will be used and
on whom? More than 20 world-class microbiologists have been murdered since
2002, mostly in the U.S. and the UK.
Nearly all were working on development
of ethnic-specific bio-weapons (see
Smart Dust, Roboflies &).
Citizens around the U.S. are frantically filing lawsuits to stop these labs
on campuses and in communities where they live. Despite the opposition of
residents living near UC Davis, where a Bio-Weapons Level 4 lab was planned,
it had the support of the towns mayor.
She suddenly reversed her position after a monkey escaped from a high
security primate facility on the campus where the bio-weapons lab was
proposed.
Residents claimed that if UC Davis could not
keep monkeys from escaping from their cages, they certainly could not
guarantee that a single virus or bacteria would not escape from a test tube.
The AWOL monkey killed the project (see Smart Dust, Roboflies&).
Population is a political problem. The extreme secrecy surrounding the
takeover of nuclear weapons, NASA and the space program and the development
of numerous bio-weapons labs is a threat to civil society, especially in the
hands of the military and corporations.
The fascist application of all three of these programs can be used to
achieve established U.S. government depopulation policy goals, which may
eliminate 2 billion of the worlds existing population through war, famine,
disease and any other methods necessary.
Two excellent examples of existing U.S. depopulation policy are,
-
First, the
long-term impact on the civilian population from Agent Orange in Vietnam,
where the Rockefellers built oil refineries and aluminum plants during the
Vietnam War.
-
Second is the permanent contamination of the
Middle East and Central Asia with
depleted uranium, which, unfortunately,
will destroy the genetic future of the populations living in those regions
and will also have a global effect already reflected in increases in infant
mortality reported in the U.S., Europe, and the UK.
