Whatever one thinks of the
George W. Bush
administration and its historical legacy, there is one fact that is beyond
dispute:
the war in Iraq galvanized the left in a manner that had not been
seen in the streets of America since the era of the Vietnam war.
Leading up
to the Democrats regaining of the House in the 2006 midterm elections, the
calls for Bushs (and, perhaps even more importantly, Cheneys)
impeachment
were echoed across the left-wing blogosphere and spilled out onto the
streets.
This crusade was led by organizations like
Veterans For Peace,
Code
Pink, and
The World Cant Wait, who used a combination of rallies, resolutions and
headline-grabbing photo ops to make the point, sometimes
quite
literally, that the Bush administration had blood on its hands and must
be removed from office.
One would have thought, given this fervent
anti-war sentiment, that these same groups would be overjoyed that
Republican congressmen would be willing to reach across the aisle and submit
a resolution to impeach the Commander-in-Chief should he wage another
unconstitutional war by committing American forces to the destruction of
Syria without so much as authorization from Congress.
In fact, just such a
move did take place last year, but rather than applaud it, the very same
supposedly anti-war left that was so active against Bush has done its
level best to ignore the very existence of the resolution and silence its
advocates.
The resolution, known as
House Concurrent Resolution 107 or HCR 107, was submitted to the House
Judiciary Committee last March by North Carolina Republican Congressman
Walter Jones, the same Congressman who sued President Obama for violating
the War Powers Act by committing American forces to Libya without
congressional approval.
HCR 107 states:
It is the sense of Congress that, except in
response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the
United States, the use of offensive military force by a President
without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates
Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8,
clause 11 of the Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable
high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the
Constitution.
Last year I had the chance to talk to
Congressman
Walter Jones about the resolution, its origins, and its
importance.
Such a resolution, if it had been introduced
just a few years ago, would have seemed like manna from heaven for the left.
Coming from a Republican, no less, it would have been the focal point for
political action in the American anti-war movement.
Coming as it did in
2012, however, few have even heard of the resolution.
You see, a funny thing happened four years ago.
The letter following the Presidents name switched from an R to a D and
just like that, the energies and activism of the self-styled anti-war left
evaporated overnight.
Under a Democrat, America could expand the
so-called war on terror into Pakistan with impunity, because, after all,
Obama is a Democrat and doing what he must to protect America from the
threat of terror.
Under a Democrat, America could develop its
drone strike program into a concerted warfare strategy, expanding it into
Yemen, Somalia, and doubtless other countries not yet disclosed, and the
anti-war advocates would fail to denounce it because, after all, hes the
President, and privy to information that we dont have about emerging
threats and hotspots.
Under a Democrat, the left is only too happy to
look the other way while the President signs into law bills to detain
Americans indefinitely without so much as a trial or develops a Presidential
kill list that supposedly gives the commander-in-chief the authority to kill
anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time, including American citizens,
without even having to explain that decision, a power that he has in fact
already invoked.
To be fair, no one is more baffled or frustrated
by this turn of events than those members of the anti-war left who are
genuinely anti-war.
The ones who do not care what party the president is
associated with or what colour his skin is. To these anti-war protesters,
the ones who were inspired by the depravity of the Bush-era atrocities to
join the activist organizations years ago, Obama is every bit as much a war
criminal as Bush was, and every bit as deserving of impeachment.
This was expressed most visibly by the
membership of
Veterans For Peace, a non-profit organization of American veterans
dedicated to abolishing war as an instrument of national policy.
Last
September at their national convention in Portland, the VFP membership
passed a resolution by majority vote calling for the organization to
officially
call for the impeachment of Obama for war crimes.
The resolution was closely modeled on a previous
VFP call for the impeachment of Bush, outlining the case against Obama from,
-
his unconstitutional unauthorized war in Libya
-
the ongoing war crimes in
Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia,
...concluding:
Therefore Be It Resolved that Veterans For
Peace call on the U.S. House of Representatives to immediately begin
impeachment proceedings against President Barack H. Obama for failure to
uphold his sworn oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the
United States of America from all enemies foreign and domestic, and for
his commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, obstruction of
justice and the violation of numerous national and international laws,
treaties and conventions.
Amazingly, however, even after having been
passed by a majority of its membership, the leadership of Veterans For Peace
has, according to its own rank-and-file, done its level best to conceal the
resolution and downplay the call for impeachment.
In an
article that has been widely circulated online, Phil Restino, the
resolutions chief proponent and a member of the Central Florida chapter of
VFP, outlines how, exactly contrary to the Bush impeachment resolution has
failed to promote the resolution or even make copies of it available to the
public, and was pestered for over a year to make available a copy of the
letter to Congress that they were required to send as a result of the
resolution calling for Obamas impeachment.
Last week,
Phil Restino joined me on The Corbett Report to talk about Veterans For
Peace and its leaderships total unwillingness to pursue the impeachment of
Obama.
When all of the facts are weighed, there is
simply no other conclusion possible: the liberal anti-war left during the
Bush years was never anti-war at all.
They were anti-Republican. Unjust
wars, after all, can only ever really be waged by Republican presidents, and
the bombs and drones and instruments of warfare acquire magical properties
under Democratic administrations where they only fall on the deserving and
take the lives of the guilty.
The saddest part of all of this, of course, is
that the prospect of impeachment and the chance for repudiation of the
bloodthirsty American government is even further from the realm of political
reality than it was under Bush.
But another sad truth to fall out from this
whole affair is that the lefts harshest critics were completely correct,
after all:
the anti-war movement was never about war after all.
In the end,
it turns out, the left now has the blood of Obamas wars on their own hands.
The silver lining, if ever there was one, is
that as a result of all of this there will be more and more waking up to the
complete charade of party politics and realizing that a true, honest
anti-war movement will have to be built from scratch, completely outside of
the two-party duopoly.
