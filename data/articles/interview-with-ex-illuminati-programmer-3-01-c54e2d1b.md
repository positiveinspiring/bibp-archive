# Interview with Ex Illuminati Programmer 3 - 01

Q: I read that Jenny Craig and a lot of weight loss centers are
in fact fronts for access to women they can program ... Ask Svali
if this is true (if she knows) and what other businesses or
non-profit organizations are involved, if any ...?
A: My answer has two parts.
First, normally, the Illuminati do NOT
do much recruiting outside their group (other occult groups do,
perhaps). They just dont trust outsiders that much. On the rare
occasions that they do, it is always a young child who is brought
in. A lot of the programming cannot be done after a certain age (8)
or it will induce severe trauma or even psychosis in a person who is
unable to dissociate adequately. You can create some functional
states, but not anything near the complex groupings and abilities
that trainers like to see.
Now, part two. Many woman who are severely overweight have been
sexually abused, and may be already dissociative. They may have
other trauma as well. So, if a person were interested in looking for
dissociators, it would make sense that they would go to places like
this. I wasnt involved in any type of recruiting activities, never
saw it done.
Some children are brought in from the outside through:
-
child pornography rings
-
these children already dissociate, so they
are "stepped up" into the cult
-
some parents "sell" their children
to be used and trained by the cult
-
some child psychologists are
taught to look for very young children
But in my reality, everyone
I knew was generational, on both sides of the family. Wish I could
help you, but this is how the Illuminati operated in San Diego and
Washington, DC. Its possible that some branches in other states do
more recruitment than I was exposed to. I have heard survivor
stories of children recruiting other children, for example, although
it wasnt done in the groups I belonged to.
A: Addendum: I just want to add that
the Illuminati are only one of
several occult groups that operate in the North American continent.
There are many others, and they may do more recruitment and things
that I havent mentioned. The Illuminists tend to have a more
scientific, and military, approach to their programming, whereas
other groups operate differently. Some groups, such as the Templar
Knights, do NOT believe in demonic worship, although they are
Luciferian and practice mysteries. Each group has its own agenda. I
can only speak for the Illuminati in the areas of the U.S. and
Europe that I lived in.
Q: Having worked professionally in numerous cities and campuses, I
have never heard of ritual abuse by leadership in our communities.
Svalis experiences appear to be genuine, however I cannot accept
the notion that this Illuminati has a dominant role in ritually
abusing children, adults and an ability to brutalize others and get
away with it without raising suspicions among the cognoscenti.
Is she actually inferring that there exists a LEADERSHIP in
professional areas and we as a public have not understood the extent
of this? Perhaps her experiences should be shared with those in the
ritually abused community. Do we really have a threat we need to
worry about?
A: In answering this, I need to raise a couple of points.
The Illuminati and their followers are a minority of our worlds
population. In San Diego county, where the population is over 2
million, there existed 5 years ago 24 sister groups with membership
of roughly 60 to 75 each. Leadership council over the county was 13
members. So, in a metro center with over 2 million, the active
Illuminists comprised less than 1500 members. The Illuminati
are
possibly 1% to 2% of the population in the US. What this means is
that 99% of the people you know and work with are NOT Illuminati.
They are good, hard working people (at least most are) who want a
paycheck, and a good family life. MOST of the leaders in our
communities and financial systems have never heard of the
Illuminati, because they are a minority.
So, why worry about them? Because a small group of evil people can
do great damage. I will use an analogy.
MOST people in our society are not involved in child pornography,
consider it a crime against children, and would fight against it
given the chance. Yet, the small minority of those involved in it do
incalculable damage to the children involved. The effects of the
crime are greater than the bare numbers involved.
Why isnt child pornography stopped? We have the evidence, law
enforcement knows it exists, yet it is a multi-billion dollar
industry. HOW do these people "hide" from justice and capture? Why
dont the police stop them? Because they arent stupid. They work
under secrecy. They change locations frequently, and kill those who
talk to law enforcement. Bribes and other means are used to cover
their tracks, and they hire excellent lawyers.
Okay, now lets look at
the Illuminists. The 1% of our nation
involved are extremely intelligent. They have sworn an oath on pain
of death from toddler-hood on to never reveal their true allegiance
to outsiders.
Do you know how many business leaders in your community are
Masons?
Yet this is not an oath on pain of death. How much less would an
Illuminist share their leanings, or be detected. I have written an
article on Suite 101 on Why the cult doesnt get caught with
more information on this topic.
I HAVE shared this information with the survivor community. I have
gone to the police, to therapists that work with survivors. I
publish on Suite 101 precisely to help educate the public and
survivors about this abuse. The main danger of the Illuminati is the
1 to 2 % involved in this group are intelligent, and many are well
funded.
