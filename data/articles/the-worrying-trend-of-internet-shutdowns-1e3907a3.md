As the year draws to a
close,
EFF is looking back at the
major trends
influencing digital rights
in 2013
and discussing where we are
in the fight for
free expression, innovation,
fair use, and privacy.

Prior to January 2011,
national or regional Internet blackouts were mostly
unheard of.
Although the
Maldives,
Nepal,
Burma,
and
China all preceded Egypt with this innovation, it
was the
shutdown initiated by former Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak that set a new precedent and garnered global
media coverage.
Since then,
Syria,
Libya, and even
San Franciscos BART police have pulled
a Mubarak.
But in 2013, Internet
blackouts became de rigeur for embattled governments:
In August,
Burma experienced a week of disruptions, the
cause of which remains unclear.
In Egypts North Sinai
region, telephone and Internet networks were -
according to
a report from Mada Masr - intermittently shut
down in September in the midst of military
operations targeting militants there.
In Sudan, where a brutal
government crackdown in September on
protests over fuel subsidy cuts resulted in the
deaths of more than 30 people, authorities
cut off Internet access in an apparent bid to
stop the demonstrations.
In October, Renesys
reported that the Iraqi government had tried but
failed to shut down the Internet.
And more recently,
Renesys spotted a
45-minute national outage from North Korea, for
which the source was unclear.
The Syrian Internet has seen
numerous outages throughout the year, some of which
appear to be politically motivated and others of which
may be structural.
In October, Aleppo was
without Internet for 17.5 hours, while in early
December, the
entire countrys Internet went down for a few hours.
Politically-motivated
Internet outages are certainly trending.
For governments, they pose
an all-too-tempting way of stifling speech and keeping
order during periods of protest or unrest, but as the
BART telecommunications shutdown in San Francisco
demonstrated, they can also prevent urgent
communications from getting through and therefore may
not be worth the risks they pose, even to the most
despotic of regimes.
