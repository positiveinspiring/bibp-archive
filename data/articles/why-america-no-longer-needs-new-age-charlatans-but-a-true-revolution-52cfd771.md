The Psychological
Drama of the New Age Charlatan
The essay below was written as an email on February 01, 2011 to Suzan
Caroll (www.multidimensions.com)
and published in my book "The
Cosmic Laws of Creation and Destruction" in Part II.
Prospectively, the analysis I have forwarded
eight months ago is still brand new and I cannot help, but have some "dej√†-vus".
I have decided to publish this essay once again
in a separate form with this new introduction because I want to address one
major issue that is in the core of all human transformation. At present,
there is a great danger that this key issue may get lost in the excitement
about the coming Ascension.
Yes, it is a cosmic certainty that most of my readers will ascend in this
fall.
The doubts are only in the minds of those, who know deeply in their
hearts that they are not that much evolved to participate in the first wave.
And there is nothing wrong about this. It is all part of the Divine Plan for
the End Times, which was already known to
Origenes, the father of Christian
exegesis,1800 years ago.
However, the spiritual self-esteem of the alleged laggards drives them into
irrational "substitution
behavioral patterns".
Freud speaks in this context about "Ersatzhandlungen"
(replacement actions). This behavior is the last rebellion of the ego,
before it must surrender to the soul as a prerequisite for Ascension.
All candidates for
First Ascension have had this experience
long time ago. Otherwise they will not belong to this wave.
This is the red line that currently runs throughout the light worker
community - the small group of way-showers without an ego as the spear head
of the Ascension process and the much larger group of light workers behind
them, who still struggle with numerous manifestations of their ego, such as
false projections and unfounded accusations.
I assume that many of my readers have
experienced similar situations in the past. I am only furnishing the
adequate deep-psychological (tiefenpsychologische, Freud) explanation for
the irrational behavior of many light workers, which is about to peak very
soon, before their ego can be ultimately eliminated.
When you know that you have no chance to ascend in the first wave, but you
want to continue to be a guru in the esoteric Vanity Fair, what do you do?
You invent a scenario that suits your inner knowledge that you will not be
among the first to ascend.
Of course, you have to hide this treacherous
knowledge from your daily consciousness, even when it devours your heart.
You may now begin to invent a scenario that fits
your interests and covers up your unspoken lies and call it the "2012
scenario", leaning yourself heavily on an empty and outdated calendar, or
you may interview anonymous sources and predict a mechanistic intervention
of highly evolved, obscure galactic civilizations on behalf of humanity in
the End Times. It is all in Internet. I am not fabricating anything.
All these approaches to the End Times have one thing in common - they
heavily rely upon an external Savior because the inner way to Redemption is
closed for these people. Their tragedy is that they are not able to perceive
or reflect on this elementary fact.
This leads to a highly schizophrenic behavior
that becomes more and more obvious in the last days prior to First
Ascension.
As the high frequency energies are exponentially growing these days, the
great cleansing of Gaia's and Humanity's dross is in full sway. Humanity has
entered in an invisible, though powerful manner a new era, where there is no
longer a place to hide negative attitudes and cheap lies anymore, as this
was a routine in the past.
But the vast majority of human beings are still not used to this state of
total transparency and blissful experience.
They stick to their old, dark habits and, as
these exacerbate, the level of irrational behavior is rapidly increasing.
This and next month will be the hell on earth for those, who do not discern
this psychological drama that is unfolding on earth. Currently, there is
virtually no information or adequate explanation of these underlying
processes from the higher realms that determine human reality.
The destiny of mankind is the collective product of the expressed free will
and determination of all human beings, or at least, the best of them - the
way-showers, the readers of this website.
But these outstanding representatives of the
human race must first stand up and say,
"Yes. We have decided to ascend and so it
will be".
This is precisely what most of my readers are
doing in these days and their reports can be read on this website.
Now imagine what will happen when all humanity stands up and says:
"We want to ascend now!".
You can forget the
Mayan
calendar and all the
2012 scenarios.
The very moment, this claim is uttered, the
whole mankind will ascend immediately. You doubt it - try it first!
The fact of the matter is that currently only very few - the most courageous
ones - say this. Therefore, only these few will ascend. The rest will have
to put up with the role of the indignant virgin, who has missed her last
chance to taste the forbidden fruit, and is now condemning the others for
their lasciviousness. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Let me be clear about one elementary fact, which is reiterated in numerous
channeled messages, but the most light workers still don't get it: From now
on, everybody creates his own destiny, independently from the others and
nobody else should be made responsible if one fails.
This is not anarchy - it is the ultimate triumph
of human free will.
Why America and the
World Need a True Revolution
This is also the time when the great revolutions of humanity take place.
Think for a moment about this fact: Most of you,
who read this message, will ascend very soon. But what about the rest of
humanity? It must still live on this planet and first change the society for
the better, before a second mass ascension wave can take place in December
2012.
But how shall the society change in the meantime as to prepare for this
dramatic leap to the higher dimensions?
You cannot expect that some highly evolved
aliens will come and provide the human race with new technology without any
dramatic changes and reforms of the political and social structure of this
rotten society. And who is responsible for these changes - only this same
human race and nobody else.
When the East German Republic was incorporated after the fall of the Berlin
Wall over night into the West German capitalist system, the first radical
act was to expropriate the whole communist planned economy of this country
and to put it under the total control of a powerful central state authority.
For almost five years all East German citizens were totally expropriated -
they were, figuratively speaking, slaves of the West German Government.
This
fact may not have leaked beyond the boundaries of this culturally rather
closed country, but this is exactly what happened during the post Cold War
period.
Similar reforms, but on a much broader scale, must now take place
immediately, after the Shift of earth and the First Ascension Wave have
taken place, while the energetic structure on this planet will alter for
ever. None of these reforms, can be implemented on a broad scale, before the
masses arise and oust their current oppressors in power.
Especially in the USA, the whole political
establishment in Washington, the Fed, the Wall Street banksters, FEMA, all
the numerous secret services must be wiped out from the surface of this
planet. But not by helpful aliens, but by the American people.
This means that the world needs a TRUE REVOLUTION in the biggest citadel of
the dark forces on this planet.
There is no other way to transform mankind, but
through a sweeping revolution - a bloodless revolution, but not less
effective. Not a single person currently on power should stay there after
11,11,11 and should continue to determine the social life of human beings.
All humans must become sovereign beings.
To achieve this level of absolute freedom, humanity must go first through a
period of total anarchy, because the anarchy is the mother of all
revolutions. This is the basics not only of all revolutions, but also of all
evolution leaps of human society. And this all you can read in your books on
history.
But who cares nowadays about history in the
light workers' circus?
Only after that can humanity begin to implement new social and structural
reforms and to introduce new advanced technologies that will carry these
reforms.
The will of the masses to liberate themselves from the present
shackles must be first expressed, before any constructive changes can take
place and relieve the plight of the human population. And there will be a
lot of plight after the Shift and the total collapse of the old order, I can
assure you.
And now I would like to urge all my readers to present me a single text or
article from the
New Age movement that discusses this or similar issues or
even presents a plausible revolutionary concept how to transform humanity.
There are none.
All current self-proclaimed esoteric gurus in the New Age Vanity Fair are
involuntary helpers of the current repressive system - they are convenient
idiots, which the dark forces have always manipulated in the past.
I agree that the dark forces from the Orion Empire will be gone immediately
after the stargate 11.11.11.will be opened.
-
But what comes next?
-
Where should one find the new
responsible, ethical, highly evolved leaders to create the New Age?
-
Could it be that the New Age will soon
end in the ditch?
Definitely, if the current spiritual charlatans
of the New Age are allowed to continue their deceptive work on a broader
scale after they have replaced the old dark ones in their warm chairs, as
this has been the case in all past human revolutions.
That is why they have all failed.
In other words, you cannot run a successful brothel with the old whores -
you need new young harlots. This is the quintessence of any true revolution.
If there should be one. But without a true revolution in the USA there will
be no chance for mass Ascension in December 2012. This is the famous "catch
22".
The danger that a large portion of humanity may not ascend is imminent, and
there is nobody in sight, who is even able to grasp the problem from an
intellectual and spiritual point of view. The masses are in a deep slumber.
The "enlightened" gurus dwell in even greater
slumber, because on the one hand they deceive themselves to be spiritually
superior to the masses and on the other they do not even rely on their own
power, but expect that some advanced aliens will come and save them.
With this kind of irresponsible, immature mentality humanity has been an
easy prey to all kinds of dark influences from the 4th astral level during
the last 10 000 years. Unless the self-proclaimed New Age elite begin to
develop new ideas how to transform humanity in a radical way after
11.11.11., there will be no way that this mankind will achieve maturity
until the end of 2012.
They will continue to carry their shackles, and
Ascension will be a chimera to them.
The Prophecy of the
Revolutionary Spirit
In the following essay, written at the beginning of this year, I was guided
by these thoughts when I explained to Sue my dynamic vision on how humanity
and in particular the American nation should begin to change in order to
acquire their certificate of maturity and become a member of the enlightened
civilizations of All-That-Is.
I cannot hide my pride how prophetic this essay was with respect to the
current total confusion of most New Age charlatans, who are completely
unaware of what is ongoing on earth, while the anonymous way-showers and
readers of this website are busy connecting throughout the globe, building
their energy network around Gaia in preparation for her Ascension in the 4th
dimension in only a couple of weeks.
At the same time they will be the first Ascended
Human Masters of the New Age.
If you do not believe me, read what
Wilcock and Co. are writing these days
and what you are writing on the Ascension Report on this website and discern
the cognitive and spiritual superiority of your ideas and knowledge.
You are
no longer the anonymous hard workers in the dark, who look up to the New Age
charlatans for guidance, but the true way-showers.
You do not even need my writings. You are
already Ascended Masters in a physical vessel. It is very important that you
realize this basic fact to the full extent as to appreciate your pivotal
role in this most dramatic event in the whole galaxy - Ascension of Gaia and
Humanity. You are the true emissaries of Light. You are the birth helpers of
the New Age and nobody else!
None of these spiritual Cinderellas have ever grasped the simple truth -
Ascension is first and foremost the individual portal to unconditional truth
and sincerity - not love.
It will take much more time for the earthans to
learn what true, unconditional love of All-That-Is is. First they must learn
what truth, righteousness and sincerity is, and only then can true love
flourish. Because unconditional love has never been a human emotion - it is
only an empty shell for the eternal synchronicity and blissful harmony of
All-That-Is.
The Whole is utterly sincere - what you think,
is what you experience.
And now comes my essay from the beginning of
this year.

Dear Sue, here is my next update. The next several months, up to the end of
this year, can be titled:
Revolutions - Revelations - Evolution -
Ascension
This is what I have already predicted for 2011
at the end of 2010.
In fact, the events are ahead of my forecast, as
I expected a calmer January, which is a clear indication that the speed of
change is gaining momentum.
Unfortunately, I predicted that the American people will be the laggards of
the world revolution. They will only awake and revolt after many other Arab
and third world countries have already revolted and ousted their dictators.
This will offset the plans of the American and English Elite to establish
the New World Order and will trigger their demise. This is the sad reality
about the American people.
In my books I have extensively explained why the American nation is the
classical young soul nation and exhibits in a paradigmatic way all the
negative characteristics, which a young soul population exhibits throughout
the 3d-reality of the solar universes. The concept of the
soul age is not truly understood by most
light workers and it is not considered at all in all the messages that I
have read so far, except for one German channel.
But it is an excellent working model in order to
understand what is now happening on earth. It is true Gnostic knowledge and
the key to an understanding of the current events.
Change will not come through sporadic UFO sightings and the chatting about
them in Internet, but through revolution. Are you prepared for it -
mentally, of course, I would not recommend you to participate in a
revolution, then it is not your destiny as a highly evolved soul.
This is the experience which young souls as the
Americans ought to make in order to evolve.
*
Believe me, I am an expert on revolutions.
What you may not know is that I was in my
previous social life, before I began with my true spiritual evolution, a
professional revolutionary and have probably more experience with
revolutions than anybody else on this planet.
I was a dissident in the early 70s in Bulgaria, when the country was a
brutal dictatorship and established the first "flying
universities", according to the Polish model, used by the
dissidents in this country. In 1968, I was associated with the
Czechoslovakian dissidents that unleashed the
Prague Spring and the greatest revolution
against the communist regime after the Hungarian Revolution in 1956.
Later on, when I emigrated to Germany, I was in close contact with COR, a
dissident Polish organization, which later evolved to Solidarnosc.
If you have read the press in the 70s and early
80s, you must be well acquainted with these terms, as they were discussed
for years in the mass media. Solidarnosc triggered the next revolution that
ultimately toppled the communist system and abolished the Iron Curtain. The
Germans would not have united without Solidarnosc winning the power in late
summer 1989.
I was present in Kosovo in the spring of 1989, when the first revolt of the
Albanian people against the Milosevic regime began.
Later on, I was a close witness of the five
subsequent wars in former Yugoslavia, which I visited on many occasions. In
1985, I worked for one year as news editor for
Radio Free Europe in Munich, at a time when
its building was hit by a bomb attack organized by the secret KGB forces and
many of us received death warnings.
I was the first politically active emigrant to return back to Bulgaria in
December 1989, when the long standing dictator Todor Zhivkov was
ousted and became one of the founders of the new democratic opposition
party, which several years later, after another revolution in 1996, which I
also attended, replaced the communist regime.
In 1992, shortly after the coup d√©tat in Moscow
against Gorbachev had failed and Yeltsin came to power and dissolved the
Soviet Union, I was in Moscow performing clinical trials at the Russian
Academy Hospitals and witnessed the dramatic events that followed the
collapse of this huge communist empire.
These are the kinds of experience that mankind will go through in the next
several months before the situation is cleared and the dark forces are
finally defeated. None of this experience belongs to the American history.
The only experience, the Americans have had with revolutions so far, has
been to suppress them brutally - either directly or through proxies.
Now you see how huge the experience deficits of the American people are and
how unprepared they are for the upcoming events. This was also a central
theme of my email to Steve Beckow. It is ridiculous to believe in earnest
that you can write and talk about UFO sightings, and the Galactic Federation
will come one day and save you on board of their space ships.
This is dangerous naivety.
Now back to the Egyptian revolution. I am watching daily Al Jazeera, being
the best channel reporting on Egypt, and then I compare it with the
statements made on BBC, CNN and NBC, which are the channels of the Elite,
and you can immediately discern the difference in approach and their hidden
agenda.
On this occasion, I would like to comment that
Al Jazeera, the best and most objective international channel worldwide to
my assessment, was forbidden in the USA as a terrorist channel and was only
allowed last year in your country on a limited basis.
This should suffice to prove the manipulation
and enslavement of the American people, being my central theme and critic
point in my letter to Steve, who seems to be completely ignorant on human
history. Ignorance is dangerous.
What we will observe in the next days and weeks, is the creeping terror and
horror of the Elite with respect to their approaching dismantling and
exposure.
To understand their current behavior, one must
take into consideration the fact that they know better than the masses and
most light workers what will happen this and next year and are paralyzed by
this dire perspective.
The Elite and the dark forces from
the
Orion Empire have for so long time dominated this planet and
their slaves - the humans - that they cannot comprehend what is currently
happening on earth: The humans are beginning to surpass their masters and
leave them alone without any slaves on a catastrophic earth B.
This is the actual dynamics behind all revolutions that will take place this
year.
You should listen to the defiance of the
Egyptians with respect to Mubarak, a classical Reptilian, and to the USA as
his ally in the many interviews given only on Al Jazeera, to understand the
true spiritual shift of collective consciousness. I can only hope that the
American people will learn something from the Egyptian people, if they are
able to learn anything from abroad, while overcoming their inherent
arrogance.
But they will have to - at the latest when the
financial system begins to crash this year and First Ascension
has taken place.
