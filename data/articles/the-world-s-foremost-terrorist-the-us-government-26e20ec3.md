This article will explain to you why the Totally
Screwed-Up US Strategic Plan for the Caspian Basin has backfired and created
a "megatrend" against America that may well be the doom of our nation.
Any country willing to spend 30 years lying, conniving and scheming - and
blow over $3 trillion (reported) on nothing - is pretty damned stupid or
desperate. In the case of American policy, I submit, both apply...and we
can, with no effort, add in DELUSIONAL.
There is nothing that George W Bush, McCain or Obama can do to change the
tide now...for it has turned into a tsunami against America.
The Grand Chessboard game is over, finished, and
the US has lost in a rout. Our nation has blown through trillions of dollars
(of new debt) with little to nothing accomplished to pursue a bogus,
contrived war that was designed to take over in excess of $15 trillion in
Caspian Basin oil and natural gas. The sheer cost of the failed 'war' and
scheme to take over the Caspian Basin has ruined the value of the dollar,
buried the US in debt and a myriad of ancillary problems, skyrocketed the
cost of oil, utilities, food, and shredded the reputation of the United
States around the world. By any measure, it is a catastrophe.
They say greed makes people do stupid things. I guess we can all conclude
that 'really stupid greedy people' do REALLY stupid things. This screw-up is
colossal. Only an MBA president like the Great Decider, who
bankrupted every company he ever ran, could do such a thorough job of
wrecking the world's largest economy and that of much of the rest of the
world, too.
If Americans would learn math and factor these monumentally needless
expenditures back into 'the real US cost for a gallon of gasoline',
Americans would wig out completely.
Every time you cringe while gassing up at the
pump, multiple that by at least 25 and you are in the ball park of the real
'net price' for each gallon of gasoline today. That, of course, does not
include the cost of blood, both foreign and American, which made it possible
for you to pay these absurd prices for gasoline.
The checkmate went to Russia and the World directly due to the massive
strategic blunders by the United States over the past 20 years. Yes, folks,
the past 20 years, not just the Bush Administration. The administrations of
George H W Bush, Clinton and
the current Village Idiot in
the Oval Office have predictably managed to put about 1,000 torpedoes
into the USS Titanic and their moronic Grand Chessboard scheme.
The ship is going down and Americans need to focus their blame and anger on
the idiotic, traitorous, terrorist warmongers in Washington, DC. Theses
vampire goons have needed no help whatsoever from any outside 'enemy' to
utterly destroy America. This was their idea and marketing plan, so let them
all burn.
That is one of the basics of Sun Tzu's classic 'The
Art of War'. Give the delusionally arrogant enough rope and they hang themselves without any
outside help... every time. There is no need to wage war on arrogant morons;
nobody can trounce them quite as thoroughly as they trounce themselves.
Past civilizations had the right idea in having the names of derelicts and
traitors stricken from every book, every temple, building and palace.
However, we shall not be that fortunate because the names of these creeps
will be plastered to libraries, freeways, aircraft carriers, and university
and federal buildings as a permanent reminder of monumental self-destruction
and treason.
San Francisco had the right idea, name a sewage treatment plant
'The George W Bush Wastewater Treatment Center.' Garbage in is garbage out.
When I wrote "One-Way Ticket To Crawford Texas, A Conservative Republican
Speaks Out" many things were uncovered during the research, investigations
and interviews I conducted as deep background for the book. Much of that
data could not be put into the book because of publishing deadlines or to
protect the identities of certain sources.
The book had 837 pages and over 950 footnotes. Many enjoyed reading the
footnotes as much as the book because they start to show the true 'Ugly
American' face of the US government. It may wind up a minor 'classic' for it
predicted what we are all seeing right now.
Many chapters of the book are about the same lunatic policies of our
government and how insane ideas become idiotic national policies and even
dumber 'strategic plans.' It explains how a brain-retarded 'strategic
vision' evolves into a 'shitforbrains national strategic plan' based on a
lust for money and power that came from the 'geostrategic imperative' of the
Grand Chessboard by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
When the DNC heard the title of the book, their Vice Chairman got in touch
with me thinking that an "off the ranch Republican" would be their 'best
buddy' for the 2004 elections. However, they were horrified when they saw
the book and how it exposed this lunatic scheme all the way back to Carter
and moved forward through George H W Bush and Clinton, and then showed why
Bush, Jr. is the complete imbecile he has proven himself to be.
I could write a six volume set the equivalent of Carl Sandberg's "Lincoln"
just from the information that was put into my hands about what a total
fraud Bush, Congress and the Global War on Terror are. I, and others, have
known from day-one that the problems rest on both sides of the aisle in DC.
We do not have a 'Dream Team' in Washington, DC representing America, now,
or will we have one in the foreseeable future. All of this euphoria about
McCain or Obama (as if he is the Messiah) is a total waste of time and
energy. Much ado about absolutely nothing.
What we have is an unmitigated nightmare leading America into the abyss
while these lying thugs line their pockets at our expense. It is a deadly
cancer and it is time for major surgery.
We have a 'terrorist organization' running America.
I have no fear of 'Al Qaeda' which is a Jimmy Carter-CIA fabrication used to
control the American Sheeple and keep them dead in their tracks, like deer
in the headlights. The biggest enemy of the American people is the
government of the United States.
As explained below, 'the world's foremost terrorist organization' is the
United States government. Read on, and I will provide you some proof.
Barky Obama Black Bush does not have a plan and apparently John McBush does
not have a damned clue. I would be more entertained if Daffy Duck Obama were
running against Mr. John MaGoo...but we are stuck with the lousy theater DNC
and RNC have scheduled for 2008. There will be no meaningful 'change'...none
whatsoever.
I totally agree with Mike Gravel. Bush does not deserve impeachment; he
deserves war criminal referral to the ICC at The Hague. However, the true
list would be much longer than just Bush and would include Big Names from
both sides of the aisle.
Somewhere between 'point A' and 'point B' we, as a nation, got lost. We
trusted our government. We trusted that it would always do the right thing,
the honorable thing, the just thing. We trusted its members to be better,
and on a higher moral ground than any possible enemy. We trusted them to not
become a tyranny... or worse, terrorists. We trusted that they would always
speak the Truth...but the only thing that flows from their mouths are
endless lies.
That should be the first clue to every American that something is amiss.
We were wrong to have ever trusted them. What and who we trusted are the
true enemy of every man, woman and child in America.
In the early years they did the right thing, but ultimately, they sold us
out. Shit happens... and it is now way past time to fix it.
Most people I know in America have a deep sense of right versus wrong. Most
people I know will follow that which God and Jesus Christ desire rather than
blindly accept orders from evil beings... such as the liar war criminal
George W Bush and his co-conspirators in the US House and US Senate.
As I was doing the research for "One-Way Ticket to Crawford Texas" I was
contacted one day by a former US Special Forces soldier. He wanted to meet
for coffee in a public place and tell me something that Americans needed to
know. I drove for hours to get to that meeting.
A full eight weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, this US
soldier was part of a special forces black ops team that was ordered to
attack both Iranian and Iraqi positions to stir up tensions in that part of
the Middle East. That was weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait to set the stage
for 'Desert Shield' and then 'Desert Storm 1991' and another completely
fabricated war by
the Bush Family. This former Special Forces soldier had
the dates, operation names, targets, etc. Through other sources I was able
to verify it all.
It was just another third-rate, based-on-lies 'Bush Show' and if Americans
are not tired yet of the 'Bush Show' they are a pretty sad lot... to the
extent of being dead from the neck up.
Many Americans have heard the babbling fool George H W Bush mumble "if
Americans only knew what we have done they would run us out of town."
Well, we Americans cannot "only knew" when we have blatant liars as leaders
and a gutless mainstream media that puts career promotions or 'talking head
status' as being more important than the truth.
Bill O'Reilly gets over $50
million a year to lie to and mislead America. The stakes are high for this
criminal cabal.
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait there had been a dispute going on in the
background. Reportedly, US oil contractors operating in Kuwait had used
'directional drilling' and 'aided and abetted' a major theft of Iraqi oil.
They were stealing oil from Iraq's southernmost oil fields... which just
happen to be very close to the Kuwait border. It took serious planning and
premeditation to pull off such a burglary.... which went on for years.
Iraq was claiming that about $7 Billion of its oil had been stolen (at 1990
oil prices) and Iraq was demanding payment or Saddam would invade Kuwait and
take payment.
Of course, this was all heating up as US Special Forces were
attacking and making Saddam think some of his neighbors were stirring up the
mess. Just for spite and good measure, George H W Bush had Special Forces
playing 'shits and giggles' with Iran at the same time they were trying to
goad Saddam Hussein into invading Kuwait. George H W Bush created the mess so
he could be a "war president" and appear to be something other than the
babbling elitist fool he is. Remember well, Daddy Bush wrecked the US
economy, too.
There was a 1990 conference call involving Washington, DC and the US
ambassador in Iraq, April Glaspie, and Saddam Hussein. To this day she is
under a 'gag order' so she cannot tell the world about what really happened
on that conference call and what a liar George H W Bush is. The US told
Saddam, unequivocally, that it did not care if he invaded Kuwait to collect
what had been stolen from his country. Saddam was told the US had no
interest whatsoever in the dispute. If the Kuwaitis owed Iraq money, sort it
out with the Kuwaitis.
Remember what I wrote just above a full 8 weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait
the US Special Forces, under order of President George H W Bush, started
attacking to stir up a hornet's nest. I will let you figure this out they
were not posing as "US soldiers".
The US wanted Saddam to think the Kuwaitis were flaunting in his face that
they were US allies, not Iraq, and could steal all the oil they wished
because the Kuwaitis had a Big Bully as an ally. Now, carry that one-step
forward as to how the controllers crafted and presented 9-11 to Americans.
They were trying to intentionally start a war - just like they did with
Afghanistan, just like they have now done twice with Iraq, and just like
they are trying to do with Iran.
Since I could not get confirmation from the 'gagged' former ambassador April
Glaspie, I had to wait to see if I would get confirmation from other
directions. Suddenly, such confirmation did show up from a retired US
employee.
There were many on that conference call since it was planned to set off a
Middle East shit storm, so the US could take the Iraqi oil and get rid of
Saddam Hussein with "Desert Storm.' They expected the hornet's nest could
quickly spread to the entire Middle East so they included the embassies all
over that area of the world in their planning. Their goal was to sucker
Saddam Hussein into invading Kuwait to collect what the Iraqi people were
legitimately due.
A former US Foreign Service person contacted me and confirmed several
things. Yes, he was on the conference call. Yes, the US already had Special
Forces attacking to stir things up, and yes, they told Saddam that they had
no interest in his dispute with Kuwait. The US also informed Saddam that
they were not going to intervene on behalf of Iraq and help recover funds
from Kuwait for the stolen oil.
So, Saddam invaded because Iraq had been robbed of billions by BushCo and
their buddies. Then the GHWB forces swung into action to 'save the world'
with 1990 Desert Shield and then 1991 Desert Storm. I remember his arrogant
pontificating like it was yesterday, "Saddam, get out of Kuwait!" What a
vile performance. What an utter betrayal of America and its people.
On January 12, 1991, Congress voted to declare war on Iraq. I have always
wondered how many of these dolts knew GHWB had Special Forces over there in
the summer of 1990 trying to get a war started and provoke Iraq to invade
Kuwait. My bet is many of them.
They are liars, folks. Our leaders are blatant, outrageous, psychopathic,
unrepentant liars.
The Zionist Jew Neocon Edward Luttwak was asked in 1991 what the US was
going to do to Iraq.
"Saddam is not like the Saudi Princes who spend the bulk of their lives
outside of their country, and who fritter away the Kingdom's oil profits on
prostitutes and bottles of champagne in Paris. No, Saddam is building
railways! Creating electrical networks! Highways and other important
elements of a serious State infrastructure!
After eights years of war
against the Iranian regime of Khomeini, he desperately needs to demobilize
his Republican Guard, which incorporates so many of this technical elite, in
order to rebuild his war-devastated country. These people are his
technicians, his engineers. If they are put to work in the way Saddam
wishes, they will rapidly make Iraq the most advanced power in the region,
and we cannot allow this to happen."
Yeah, I can understand why George H W Bush would not want Americans to know
that he started that Desert Storm war and intended to do just that.
I can
see where that fact does not 'jive' with the Presidential Legacy they keep
trying to mold for him. Sort of like trying to create a 'great monumental
sculpture' from countless tons amounts of bullshit rather than marble or
clay.
Do you recall the Bush speech after Desert Storm?
"Now, we can see a new
world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of
a new world order."
Right. One based on endless lies.
That is why everything has to be such a 'big damned secret'; why they lie
and they intend to keep on doing just that. That is part of selling their
stupid strategic plan to control and dominate all things.
I do not know who can be credited with the quote "Like father, like son" but
I think they probably knew the Bush Family pretty well.
The research continued and the more I did the more confirmation I received
that we are led by evil agenda players, not to mention one of the sleaziest,
murderous families in the history of the nation, if not the planet.
At dinner one night, I was meeting with a US Army major who was having a
very deep battle of the conscience. Even someone trained to kill as a
profession has a conscience and usually weighs the issues of right versus
wrong, legal versus criminal, just versus evil, etc.
That is most often the case until one meets the mercenary types employed by
firms like
Blackwater USA, which put money far above human life. Many of the Blackwater killers are on laced up on drugs to dull their senses for
rampant, indiscriminate killing. I have met some of the former Blackwater
USA employees. Chronic, serious use of drugs, severe drinking problems and
clinical psychosis are common issue among their employees.
I could explain
to them why they have a 'bruised spirit' but they would have to want that
help for it to do any good.
America, at its core, is essentially still a nation of good people for the
most part. Unfortunately, we are being riddled by the malignant affliction
of being ruled, governed and societally-programmed by idiots, liars and
arguably the most evil people on Earth.
At this particular dinner meeting, I was stunned to hear some of the details
that were being conveyed to me across the table. And I am not an easy person
to shock. This person was stationed at Landstuhl, Germany at the Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center. That is where our troops are mainly sent when they
are injured in battle or require evacuation for medical attention. That is
also where the 'Official Morgue' is located.
I was shocked to learn that many US troops have been delivered to Landstuhl
on life-support due to a 'mystery' pneumonia. Many of them died at Landstuhl
or were dead when they arrived (DOA)... still plugged into life support.
They
were not part of the official KIA (killed in action) stats in Iraq... by order of
Bush and
Rumsfeld.
I was shocked to learn that many US troops also have chronic problems with
DVT, or deep vein thrombosis, after they were given 'vaccines' for CBW that
they will not even encounter on the field of battle or in their Iraq or
Afghanistan missions. Those injections are given, yet again, just to line
the pockets of some of the DoD and BushCo insiders. Firms such as... BioPort
and DynPort Vaccines, LLC, that hybrid of a biotech and a mercenary company
that the FBI keeps overlooking as a suspect in the anthrax attacks in the
US.
DVT causes huge blood clots if not treated. The NBC reporter David Bloom and
MANY US troops have died or suffered major health setbacks due to heart
attacks, strokes or pulmonary embolisms due to blood clots caused by DVT... resulting
directly from the Anthrax 'vaccine' they are injecting into our young men
and women. Our nanotechnology researchers have been on that matter for 4
years now, working on ways to block it or reverse it.
I was further shocked to learn that many of our troops are diagnosed at
Landstuhl as having a rare disorder (only 1 per 500,000 in a normal
population) that is abundantly common in our US troops after they have had
the usual course of vaccine injections. It will take time to nail it down,
but it currently appears that possibly as many as 25% of US soldiers have
this rare disorder. That huge spike, as compared to a normal population, is
too high not to be noticed as being tied to what the DoD and their pet
contractors are injecting into our US troops.
If that affliction rate holds
up, it means from 250,000 to 500,000 US soldiers could now have it.
It's called 'amyloidosis' and while it can be deadly, it is almost always
debilitating. The doctors and nurses at Landstuhl were under orders to
'diagnose' this new disorder as sprains, fatigue, wear and tear due to
physical exercise, carrying heavy army packs on their backs, and hard
soldiering work in the desert heat, etc. I was told that some of the
soldiers were in so much pain they could not even sit in a chair... but were
still expected to serve and perhaps die for Emperor Bush in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
It was little wonder to me that when I met some of the US soldiers with this
nightmare, I found that they call themselves "the Walking Dead" because of
how awful they feel and how ruined their lives are. Amyloidosis is most
likely a direct result of the ruthless barrage of dangerous, sometimes
deadly, and ultimately
useless 'vaccines' they are
forced to take.
I have,
by now, met several thousand soldiers... and about TWENTY-FIVE percent of
them are said to be afflicted.
Amyloidosis causes the human body to produce amyloid proteins which the body
cannot handle properly. These proteins destroy joints and vital organs, and
over time result in permanent disability and sometimes death. This is the
same crap Bush wanted to inject into all American citizens under his lunatic
Project BioShield.
The biggest shock of all was learning that vast numbers of our troops are
now confirmed as having been exposed to
Depleted Uranium (DU) with often
extremely heavy concentrations of it found in their blood and body organs.
However, once again, the doctors and nurses were under direct orders to not
disclose DU poisoning to the soldier, not to make any note of it in their
medical records which would create a 'criminal chain of evidence.'
They are,
instead, instructed to take blood samples only, freeze them, and that the DoD will 'check back on the soldiers' in a few years to see how they're
doing. Many, of course, will be dead or dying, or to have produced deformed
children, or to have contaminated their spouses and families with it.
You have probably already guessed... the DoD never bothers to check back on
the soldiers at all.
DU weapons were banned by the UN as a "weapon of indiscriminate harm"
because after it kills, it just keeps right on killing civilians living in
the area such weapons were used... like Bosnia, Palestine, Iraq, Kuwait,
Lebanon and Afghanistan. That list does not include the many US military
bases where they have been shooting DU weapons for years and polluting
America, too. In fact, DU contaminated sand was recently shipped from Kuwait
to IDAHO... since the Kuwaitis are our good buddies because they helped get
rid of that evil Saddam after he caught them stealing billions of dollars of
Iraq's oil.
Two of the reasons I have had to fight the Bush Administration
professionally (nanotechnology) are because we are trying to do something
about the DVT/Anthrax vaccine problems and the DU. They do not want a chain
of evidence to nail their asses to the wall, and we are building such a
chain to do just that. 'Indiscriminate harm' and 'genocide' are accurate
ways to sum up the entire Bush Administration, and those of Clinton and
Daddy Bush.
If the United States government will not help our soldiers, I am, as a
United States citizen, trying to find a way to help them.
Many are dying of other conditions and are experiencing major health
problems. Of course, all ignored by DoD under the 'Feres Doctrine' that
grants immunity to our DoD and defense contractors for such criminal
negligence. Since DoD is immune, who is George Bush to really care about the
well-being of our US troops?
Under Bush orders (and idiotic policies), millions of our soldiers now have
ruined health and ruined lives. It is time for accountability for 'knowingly
harmful actions' and to Hell with the Feres Doctrine.
I was also shocked to learn that those troops delivered to Landstuhl Germany
on life-support (regardless of reason) are not declared dead until they
reach Germany and are therefore not part of the KIA (killed in action) from
Iraq or Afghanistan. Some of those people were dead when flown out of Iraq
or Afghanistan but the 'diagnosis' was delayed until they reached Germany so
they did not show up in the Official DoD Certified KIA for Iraq or
Afghanistan.
Such "strategies" are to keep American citizens from knowing the true toll
of carnage the US has suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan under the beyond
stupid Bush Plan.
But, what really stunned me and broke my heart the most was something else
this US Army major disclosed to me. By the time our dinner meeting was over,
we went to the couple's home to talk in private. I was fuming by that time,
as you may well imagine.
Landstuhl, as the MSM told us, was receiving injured from the Iraq and
Afghanistan "theater of operations" where the US was claiming so many
successes.
However, it was ALSO receiving wounded from places like
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan where our evil
government was trying to carry out Special Forces Ops to target and kill
those who were standing in the way of the BushCo regime and its Grand
Chessboard, Fake Global 'War on Terror' scheme.
Standing in the way of their precious pipeline across Turkmenistan and
Afghanistan! Standing in the way of their taking over huge amounts of oil
and natural gas in the Caspian Basin! Standing in the way by siding with
pipelines that were headed north into Russia or east to China!
Standing in
the way by signing up with non-US oil companies!
I asked "Are these medical need cases from the military bases Bush has put
in the Caspian Basin area or combat related injuries?"
Response: "They are both...need for general medical treatment and combat
related. Vehicle accidents, non-combat injuries, major illness, combat
injuries, etc."
I asked "Interesting, I do not seem to recall reading in 'the news' that the
US is involved in combat operations in those nations. Are we talking about
black ops?"
Response: "Yes, it is almost all black ops in those nations."
I asked. "How did you know that these troops had been injured in those
nations and not say in Afghanistan?"
Response: "Because they were angry at what they had been sent to do and they
wanted someone to talk to about it. As their care providers, safe in the
hospital late at night, they cried, they talked, they confessed to us what
they had been sent to do. We are all under orders to shut up, not tell the
truth, but soldier-to-soldier we talked a lot. I heard more than I was
prepared to hear. Due to the horrid extent of the injuries, I saw more than
I was prepared to see."
[This major showed me a DVD of photos from the triage, operating rooms and
ICU. I have never in my life seen such horrible photos and I do not have a
weak stomach.]
I asked. "Why would a tough special ops soldier be crying? Loss of a fellow
soldier, loss of a leg or limb, or God-forbid his genitals, or face
unrecognizable anymore?"
Response: "Because of what they were sent to do, once they figured out what
the real mission was."
I asked "Like what? What was enough to make the toughest US soldiers cry?
Protecting the high and mighty Americans from the "terrorists"?
Response: "No, they were sent to be the terrorists and it is why they were
sent that had them crying. Some of them were afraid that God would never
forgive them, and, I think they might be right at times. There were some
attacks on the US soldiers by people who do not want us there and some 'pay
back' attacks after US forces had attacked them, but for the most part what
I was being told about was the US conducting intimidation and terrorism
operations against civilians. to get their oil and gas."
I asked "Really? US? The honorable, truth-telling US of A being "terrorists"
in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan.. and Tajikistan? Please explain."
Response: "Many of the people in those areas do not like America, do not
trust America. Many are competing to get control of areas of land that have,
or are thought to have, vast amounts of oil or natural gas. Some of it is
oil and gas leases, some of it pipeline right-of-way to get it to a port and
ship it all over the world."
I asked "I know, the Caspian Basin mother lode, the idiotic Grand
Chessboard. That is why I have been reporting on and researching the Caspian
Basin and the real reasons we attacked Afghanistan to steal a pipeline deal
from an Argentina company. Have these soldiers been sent in to strong arm,
threaten, terrorize, etc with these Big Oil thugs and things got too hot,
shooting started?"
Response: "Some times yes, but that is not what had many of them upset
unless they did lose a fellow soldier or yes, they lost a future because of
their injuries. What had them upset was they were sent to kill entire
families under the pretense of "hitting a terrorist base" and they found out
later that it was not a terrorist base. It was the home of a father, mother,
children, grandparents who would not roll over for Bush and his thugs and
sign over their property or the oil and gas rights. They were uh, in the way
of the "Big Mission". These were people who refused to sign over their land
and energy rights to US Big Oil. It was a 'tract of land' Big Oil wanted and
these people were refusing."
I asked. "So, it is true. Anyone daring to stand in the way of those
trillions in oil and natural gas is classified as a "terrorist" and
eliminated?
Response: "Exactly, and that is exactly why I contacted you. Japan, China,
Russia, and others are over there to sign up the oil and gas leases, but the
US is the only one I know of that is going in there and terrorizing or
killing people to get its way. They are using US soldiers to try to force
people to sign a contract or kill them and take it from them anyway. The
truth has to get out about what Bush has done and used 9-11 as the excuse to
do it. These black ops started way before 9-11. They had to get oil and gas
leases signed, then they had to get the pipeline under control."
"Many of our soldiers have already figured out that 9-11 was just to get the
pipeline they need across Afghanistan. Many of these soldiers know they were
'used' to get the oil and gas leases nailed down so there would be something
to put through that pipeline."
"The US Army or Marines cannot tell you the truth, lest they want to face
court martial and spend the rest of their life in Leavenworth. As for me, I
am no longer concerned about making grade to colonel or general. I am
resigning my commission and getting out of this web of lies and evil. I can
no longer serve this nation and what it really stands for and what is does
and will not tell America. I'm finished."
I asked "Were you able to determine from any of these special ops soldiers
how long such covert operations had been going on prior to
9-11?"
Response: "Yes, according to some of them these operations had been going on
for up to a year before 9-11 and possibly even longer. They had to nail down
those oil and gas leases, pipeline right-of-ways because many other nations
were after the same oil and gas deals."
I continued. "The thought just occurred to me, how do they explain these
injuries or KIA of these soldiers who are waging black ops against civilians
in nations we supposedly have no ongoing military operations? Afghanistan?
Response: "Afghanistan some times if after October 7, 2001, or they list
them as 'victims of terrorists' without explaining that they were killed or
injured conducting acts of terrorism against civilians and a fire fight
broke out. Innocent humans except they were sitting on land with oil and gas
under it. There were some attacks on US troops as 'pay back", but most of
the attacks were terrorism by the US against those who were not cooperating
with the US objectives in the region. If they cannot come up with an excuse,
since the ops are black, they just ignore it ever happened."
I cannot say what you are feeling right now as you just read through that,
but I was sickened to my stomach that night and have been ever since that
night. That meeting with the US Army Major was the day I stopped being a
proud American.
The reason I was offended and angered is that those are all illegal orders.
These were orders originated by a US war criminal at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
If such happened even once... it happened one time too many. This US Army
Major confirmed that many discussions were held with many wounded US
soldiers over a period spanning months. There were many such black ops
targeted at many people who were judged to be 'in the way.' This happened
far more times than George Bush or Bill Clinton want anyone to know about.
What the Major was seeing in the hospital at Landstuhl was for the most part
US soldiers who were injured by someone who was defending their rights and
their property. This man had many heart-to-heart talks with these wounded
soldiers. Few of them were angry at a Turkmen, or an Uzbek, or a Kazakh.
They were angry at who sent them and why they were sent.
It did not take long for many of them to figure out that they had been sent
under illegal orders to commit murder, not take out a terrorist. Some of the
missions were literally to kidnap persons who had been labeled 'terrorist'
but were really just resisters defending their property rights.
Most of our US soldiers have very strong sense of duty, but they also have
very strong senses of right versus wrong and they have good instincts to see
wrong for what it is. In their hands are matters of life and death, and they
do not take that as lightly as the arrogant bastards in Washington, DC who
don't have the courage to stand on that front line... cowards that they are.
I asked "Did any of these soldiers admit to you how they figured out that
someone had ordered them on an illegal mission, an illegal order, to go
process a death warrant on civilians who would not sign a contract?"
Response: "Yes, because I had the same question. There was a targeted site,
an alleged "terrorist camp". and the team leader sent snipers as advance
recon to get into position and closely watch a house. A smart soldier will
always size up what he is about to lead his men into. While they were
watching a vehicle pulls up, three men get out and there is a huge argument
regarding a stack of papers the men were trying to get them to either take
or sign.
It was a US oil company truck and they were ordered off the
property at gun point. They then went to another house about half-mile away
that could be also be seen by the snipers, where a second group ordered them
off the property at gun point, would not accept or sign the papers. That
night they were ordered to 'take out' everyone at both houses. They had
already been briefed on the 'intel regarding the alleged terrorist camp' and
knew that both houses could not fit what the mission description was.
That
was when they realized that the orders were to remove "resisters" not
'terrorists'. Most were women and children. The reason more than one of that
team were at Landstuhl was the locals were more than prepared and repelled
the attack that night. As one soldier of that team said, 'those folks know
how to deal with burglars. I am lucky to be alive'.
I am not naïve enough to think that all such attacks were repelled."
What was being described to me pre-dated 9-11 in the Clinton and Bush
Administrations and continued on as they launched their bogus, fraudulent
Global War on Terror. As this US Army Major talked, I was remembering
Operation Gladio where US, UK and NATO were conducting terrorist operations
against innocent people in Europe to get their way.
As I was driving back home, I thought about the Special Forces soldier who
was involved prior to Desert Shield/Desert Storm and about what I was just
told that predated 9-11 in the Caspian Basin nations. I had to resist the
urge several times to pull over on the side of the road and throw up... over
their description of what America had become.
I know exactly what these arrogant murderous bastards are after, and have
been since they planned 9-11 so they could launch this hideous, murderous
scheme... this 'lunatic strategic plan.' I did not know until that night that
even before 9-11 they were attacking and taking out families in the Caspian
Basin area who did not want to sign over their property or their oil and gas
rights to the US thugs.
That was when I truly understood the level of evil that has taken control of
our nation and our government. These are not legitimate "missions" in
defense of America; they are death warrants to kill people who do not wish
to roll over to US demands.
Anyone who would prefer to do business with others, were labeled
"terrorists" and murdered or extorted into complying with US demands, or
'disappeared'. If they would not sign the contracts with Big Oil, the 'T"
designation was hung on them, and elimination was next. Sign the contract or
die.
I can well imagine that some were 'tortured' into signing the contracts.
They may still be torturing some into signing the contracts. Think on that
one.
Folks, these are the acts of desperate people who are wickedly sick in mind
and heart.
Resisting is not 'terrorism' by a property owner. It is, by legal
definition, self-defense of family and property and what was rightfully
theirs and not rightfully the property of Big Oil or BushCo. People have a
legitimate right to get the best price for what they own... but not when they
happen to be standing in the way of US hegemony and pipedreams of trillions
and trillions and trillions of oil and natural gas.
If they refuse to sign
with BushCo, they are 'terrorists'...
The
GITMO fiasco has already proven many in our government are psychopathic
liars and conducting illegal actions and violations of human rights against
many people.
When some of the military started objecting to such orders, they were
'relieved of duty'. The tasks were handed over to the mercenary firms, since
they will do anything for money.
In my travels in the EU and elsewhere, I have noticed and met many people
from Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, etc. I started asking
questions as to why they were no longer living in their homeland. They are
afraid to live in their homeland. They are afraid of the US and their black
ops killers who come in the night like the thugs, thieves and murderers they
are. And the terrorists they are.
Countless people were targeted by George W Bush for execution as terrorists
because they wanted to take a better business offer from others. Merely
designate them as 'terrorists' and target them for elimination, entire
families. It was that night that I had a totally clear picture of what some
in the US will do for oil and natural gas and domination of anyone who gets
in their way.
They were also targeted by Clinton as muscle for Big Oil, so I rest my case.
Both sides of the aisle are corrupt and criminal.
I laugh when I think now of what a total failure their scheme has turned out
to be. These people are past nuts, they are completely insane.
The Bush Family is all about "family values"? Do not believe that bullshit
lie for even a nano-second. If you believe a word that comes out of the
mouth of any Bush family member, you are a complete fool. They are family
killers. And don't forget it.
That, folks, is the mark of a war criminal and a terrorist.
AND THEY FAILED - AND IT DOES NOT TAKE SHERLOCK HOLMES TO FIGURE OUT WHY!
I have no way to confirm this. but I am willing to bet that many of those
persons being held by our government reportedly up to 26,000 people are
not terrorists at all. My bet is many of them are "property owners" in the
Caspian Basin who would not cooperate with the Grand Chessboard lunacy. My
bet is they are being tortured (or punished) for not rolling over and
handing their oil and gas over to the Thugs of BushCo.
I think often about the 'Big Picture' implications of how incredibly stupid
this "Bush Strategery" has proven to be. No wonder the former Russian states
are welcoming Russia back in. They want protection from BushCo.
I do have confirmation from two governments (and citizens of those nations)
in that area, that they figured out what the US was up to and ordered them
to 'cease and desist' or. get out of the Caspian Basin, period.
So, this is who we have sitting in the Oval Office: a world terrorist, a
liar, a murderer, and war criminal as our president. To the shame of
America, Clinton did this same kind of evil, too, and so did Daddy Bush.
Sadly, Bush Lite (McCain) and Bush Dark (Obama) would keep the same status
quo in place like the unthinking, compromised, sock-puppet morons they are.
Great, one of them is going to be our next 'Terrorist in Chief.'
They are 'All American Terrorists.' They are all liars and they are all war
criminals and murderers and traitors to the very spirit of America. They are
leaders of nothing but a pack of murderous thugs.
What has been interesting and infinitely predictable, is that most of the
Caspian Basin is standing its ground and signing contracts with ANYONE BUT
THE UNITED STATES or UNITED KINGDOM. They are not about to let the US have
its way after what they have done.
It will take years to know the full damage of such policies, such senseless
acts of US sponsored terrorism. Some day, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, etc, will publish who has the natural gas and oil
leases and how much is being sold to what nations. When that happens,
America will truly see how little of the oil and natural gas the US was able
to control through commercially abusive business practices, threats and acts
of terrorism.
When those facts are known, the sheer lunacy of the
Obama/Brzezinski continuing push for the Afghanistan pipeline will be known,
too.
Then we shall truly know how stupid this entire Grand Chessboard scheme has
been from its inception. Folks, this has been the most colossal failure of
thinking in the history of the United States. Their 'strategic vision' that
they could do anything they wanted because the US was the only Superpower
was a brain spasm of the magnitude of Krakatoa blowing up.
Their 'strategic plan' that they could be terrorists and get the oil and gas
and the money, and get away with it because they were shouting 'terror' and
'terrorists' more than anyone else, was incredibly stupid.
The main mission was to prevent the locals from signing with others and to
force them to sign with the US oil companies under commercially abusive,
unacceptable terms and conditions. Sign the contracts under duress, at gun
point, at threat of death if they did not sign, or 'kill those terrorists'
and take it any way.
I know some of the terms that Russia, China and Bridas have put forth and
they are much more equitable than what BushCo thought it could cram down the
throats of the Caspian Basin citizens who have oil and natural gas under
their lands.
Remember the recent piece "What to do? What to do?"
""He admitted to the pipeline 'mission' in Afghanistan and Rumsfeld quickly
corrected him, the entire DC 'spin cycle' had to scramble to cover its
tracks because this was PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.
As they say, oops!
"In April 2001, Tommy Franks, the commander of US forces in the Persian
Gulf/South Asia area, testifies to Congress in April that his command's key
mission is "access to [the region's] energy resources." The next month US
Central Command begins planning for war with Afghanistan, plans that are
later used in the real war May 2001 (F)). Sydney Morning Herald, 12/26/02]
Other little noticed but influential documents reflect similar thinking
September 2000 and April 2001 (D))." "
The black ops, the acts of intimidation and US terrorism and slaughter
started well before 9-11. Here the commanding General Tommy Franks was
admitting to Congress what the 'key mission' was of his command. The
'region' includes Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan as
well as Afghanistan for the pipeline.
There were some soldiers there trying to build good-will and do the right
thing. There were others sent there to do the unspeakable. Some times they
even got their asses kicked by people defending their property, their
family, their rights. Since they were 'black ops', not a word about their
missions came from BushCo. They just didn't exist.
This is the sort of evil your taxpayer dollars are being used for, America.
Wake the Hell up, especially you idiots over in the Christian community.
You
idiot Far Right Christian folks are aiding and abetting murder, terrorism,
genocide and war crimes and the wiping out of entire families of innocent
people by US acts of terrorism...who just happened to have oil and gas under
their property.
Just so America could have gas for those Soccer Mom SUVs, and shopping,
Christian retreats, and $20 million jets for Kenneth Copeland, and.
"One Nation under God?"
Do not believe that lie for a nano-second. We are a
nation led by a terrorist organization. That is why they lie so much and
cannot utter a single word of truth.
I think Americans need to start demanding 'full disclosure' on four matters:
-
The name and country of origin, country of "extraordinary rendition" of
each and every person 'nabbed' by the US government as an alleged terrorist,
including total number of persons held, where held and why; and
-
The name of every person who owned property on any "oil and gas lease"
tract in any Caspian basin nation, or pipeline right-of-way, and that oil
and gas lease is signed with a US Oil company and the identity of that US
Oil company; and
-
The identity of every oil and gas lease in the Caspian Basin held by any
US oil company and the date they entered into that oil and gas lease, and
the identity of the US and non-US parties on the contract for that oil and
gas lease; and
-
The whereabouts of each and every such person who signed with the US on
any tract of land, wherever in the Caspian Basin.
I would be willing to bet that some of those "oil and gas deals" are fake
signatures on the non-US side of the contract. I also think many of those
owners are among the 26,000 our government is holding as 'alleged
terrorists' and still refusing to roll over for BushCo.
There is a simple moral to this entire US created fiasco: If one wants to
take over an area of Oil and Natural Gas controlled by Islamic nations, the
dumbest thing one can do is declare a Global War on Islam and really piss
off the people that have what you want.
Their "Second Really Dumb Move" was to be the exact terrorists that they
claim they are defending the world from.
Checkmate, the Grand Chessboard game is over.
