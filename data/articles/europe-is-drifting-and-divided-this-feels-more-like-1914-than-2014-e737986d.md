# Europe is Drifting and Divided - This Feels More Like 1914 than 2014

Angela Merkel and David

too little detente.

With every day that passes it gets easier to see
how Britain might accidentally stumble into withdrawal from the
European Union into a highly uncertain future by 2017.
More than that, with every passing day that the
Eurozone fails to address its economic malaise and political
paralysis, it becomes easier to imagine the EU's eventual
break-up into
well, no one knows, but it will not be pretty.
Last week the Brussels commission sprung a
surprise on David Cameron, though not on Treasury
officials and diplomats, it seems, in the shape of
that Â£1.7bn surcharge which Angela Merkel - and now
Denmark's Mrs Borgen - say London must play by the rules and pay
without complaint.
Apparently they don't realize that it can't do so
without also gifting sackfuls of know-nothing votes to the UK
Independence party.
No one's fault: just a triumph of bureaucratic
rigidity of view over the creative juices of constructive
statesmanship, one which will feed the Europhobic frenzy in
Britain as similar disputes do across the EU 28. In similar
fashion, all Wednesday's newspapers carry alarming and alarmist
reports about immigration - much of it based on ignorance, as
this Guardian analysis shows.
But the problem is real.
Millions of desperate
and frightened people from beyond Europe seek to get here by
fair means or foul, as the
mayor of Calais's testimony to Westminster underlined again
on Tuesday, and the response of the governing classes is
woefully inadequate, as Mayor Natacha Bouchart also explained.
The media is no more coherent: faced with the
drowning horrors in the Mediterranean (lorry horrors at Calais
too), the liberal wing wants
to let more in while also seeking to increase low wages
which burden 5 million British workers and fuel Ukip's angst.
Yes, there is a connection, chaps, as Rafael
Behr
acknowledges here.
As for Fleet Street's oligarch media, it loves
the foreign-billionaire London which helps price many of its
readers out of the capital, despises poor migrants who keep the
city going and plays footsie with Nigel Farage who is all mouth
and very little trouser.
Skilled foreign workers, wealthy
Chinese tourists and lucrative foreign students feel discouraged
by compensatory xenophobic rhetoric and sharp words at street
level - as
the Archbishop of Canterbury reports.
Do other countries do better? It's patchy.
Spain
is slowly recovering from the recession as Italy is not. Both
are exposed to the Argentinean debt crisis as well as their own.
France is looking towards President Marine le Pen as the Hollande regime fails to address deep economic problems via
market-facing reform.
Germany's state banks are heavily
indebted, but avoided the European Central Bank's (ECB's) recent
stress test. The play-by-the-rules crowd rarely apply the rules
against Germany - or France, whose budget now looks set to be
nodded through in breach of those sacred rules.
Germany? Having near-bankrupted its Eurozone
neighbors by its Wonga-style fiscal policy ("pay up or we send
in the bailiffs") Germany's own export-orientated economy
is finally faltering too.
The Great Recession is not over
yet and looming Eurozone deflation - low growth and falling
prices - may drag Britain's fragile recovery back down too.
Immigration? Chancellor Merkel scolds Cameron and
insists on unfettered free movement of labour. But Britain's
population has risen by 5 million since 2001 (see ONS figures here), primarily migration-driven, while
Germany has 12% foreign-born but one of the
lowest birth rates in the world.
On current trends, both
countries are heading towards 70 million citizens - us up from
64 million, them down from 82 million - lots of them very
elderly in both countries. We will learn which demographic graph
proves the wise one in due course.
As in much else in 2014, it feels eerily like the
prelude to the outbreak of war in 1914 must have felt.
Everyone
knows something is terribly, dangerously wrong with the way we
are conducting our collective affairs, woefully short-term in
our responses, seeking safety by compromising on the basics -
like a householder cancelling the fire insurance to save money.
Strong leadership?
The voters say they want it,
but recoil from the real thing: look how they came to dislike
and mistrust Margaret Thatcher and (formidable but a less
substantial figure) Tony Blair when they tried to impose
unpopular solutions for the long term.
They vote instead for weak government - as they
did in Britain in 2010 and will again next May - then complain
about the results, as they do across the channel where most
ruling governments are bedeviled by the tactical imperatives of
maintaining coalitions while keeping an eye on the best chance
of breaking free at the next election.

Nick Watt's
baleful account of last night's Commons
maneuvers
here - trading an EU referendum for concessions on the bedroom
tax. Arggh...!
Spooked by Ukip, the prime minister is painting
himself into an ever-smaller corner on EU renegotiation, on
immigration, on the EU arrest warrant - and on the European
Convention on Human Rights, which is not an EU matter at all.
It's not that Cameron is wrong on all
particulars: Britain is proving too much of a magnet for eastern
European migrants, the two European courts do make foolish and
self-aggrandizing judgments, we could all benefit from more
selective EU regulation, less can be more.
But Britain has
mishandled immigration policy and procedure for decades without
EU help.
Here we go again today...
On top of which, Cameron's repeated failure at
alliance-building in Europe, his willingness to blink rather
than call Ukip's bluff, is craven. Who in sight would be better?
I'll ring you back.
Is Merkel up to the important job of saving
him from himself? It's beginning to look like No.
Despite rising bellicosity of language, I still
don't believe Cameron wants to take Britain out. Nor do Boris
Johnson, Philip Hammond and the other "Brexit" chancers.

war.

H.H. Asquith
and
Edward Grey didn't want to take us into war in 1914 either:
they just drifted into it.
Merkel and Hollande have the same
problem in reverse:
any sign of flexibility towards Britain
("Don't leave us alone with the French," a German MP begged a
Tory conference fringe meeting) gives them domestic grief they
can ill afford when Eurozone coherence is so fragile.
Disappointment and suspicion abound; the public
mood is ugly.
Yes, the xenophobic sentiments have alerted
sensible opinion and raised public support in Britain for the EU
to its highest level for 30 years. But that could so easily be
swept away by miscalculation and jingoism on both sides of the
EU debate as Cameron's promised 2017 referendum looms, much as
the peace party was swept aside in 1914.
The same goes for
Europe if it can't shake off recession: a north-south split
anyone?
It wouldn't matter quite so much - or so urgently
- if external friends and foes did not detect weakness among the
European partners.
The US, itself suddenly enfeebled, is less
interested and less respectful. In Iraq Isis senses it can
frighten Europe into passivity,
as can Vladimir Putin,
whose diplomatic skills repeatedly
outshine the EU's - and not always for expansionary or malign
purpose.
The other day the EU
abandoned a case it was making at the World Trade
Organization
against China over allegedly illegal subsidies to makers of
Chinese mobile phone network equipment. It's said that the
Europeans were too divided and that Beijing has been picking
them off singly with national concessions.
Too divided to negotiate together, too weak to
negotiate alone? If we're not careful, that may be the future
and it isn't a cheerful prospect.
Divided we fall.
