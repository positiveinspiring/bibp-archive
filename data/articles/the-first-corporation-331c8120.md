Thousands of years ago people lived in close
knit clans and the population of the world was only a tiny fraction of what
it is now. People could go an entire life time without ever encountering a
stranger.
Unfortunately, sometimes strangers purposely
encountered them.
One particular day at one particular village a very long time ago, such an
encounter took place. It was just after dawn on a foggy morning that the
village clan was going about its normal morning routine. Firewood was
gathered, fires were lit, and food preparation was underway. Mothers breast
fed their babies, children played and elders sat waiting to be fed.
The comforting sounds of fire crackling and children laughing were
interrupted by the muffled rumbling of hoof beats and the sharp clatter of
scraping metal coming from somewhere beyond the fog. The sounds grew louder
and more distinct by the second, and so, sensing danger, the people of the
clan quickly gathered together in the center of the camp.
Moments later, emerging from the haze came a terrifying vision: men on
horseback draped in animal skins and headpieces with long pointed horns,
their faces painted, some wearing masks with menacing non-human expressions.
The villagers had never seen anything like this before.
Not knowing if these beings were humans, spirits
or even monsters their hearts thumped hard in their chests as they stood
paralyzed, watching the creatures growing nearer.
As was intended, the strangers had caught the village inhabitants completely
by surprise. They rode into the camp then viciously slew every man in the
village with razor-sharp flesh-cutting blades. Throats were slashed and
skulls were crushed; innocent blood flowed in hot rivers and soaked the
ground. Violence like this had never been seen there before.
The women and children were shocked and traumatized, and they tried to run,
but they could not escape. They were all rounded up and brought back to the
center of the camp, then separated into two groups, women on this side, and
children on that side. Some of the horrifying creatures searched through
every dwelling and looked up every tree to make certain they'd found every
last member of the clan.
When all of the women and children had been found and separated the
strangers dismounted their horses and killed every child one by one. Babies,
toddlers, everyone under the age of 12 was slain with swift deliberation.
They then turned their attention to the women.
Any who were old, sick, or pregnant were also killed. The rest would be
taken to be their slaves and wives. They took whatever pillage they found
desirable from the camp, then pulled the women onto their horses in front of
them and began the journey home.
Behind them lay a sickening scene of incomprehensible carnage. Bloody,
dismembered dead bodies of children, women and men were the last thing the
surviving women saw before being dragged onto the horses and taken away. The
innocent dead were the silent remnants of a story that no one would ever
hear.
The brutal strangers whipped their horses with leather straps and rode them
hard, desiring to get home before nightfall. They made good time and when
they arrived they beat the women, raped some of them, humiliated them, and
began to break them. Over the following days they forced them to cook and
clean for them, sew their garments and make their living spaces comfortable.
The women gathered wood, tended the fires, brought water for their
households and slowly accepted the imposed routines of their new unasked for
lives.
They also wept for their murdered children and
husbands, and mothers and fathers and other family members, but they did so
only when they would not be caught and punished for their tears. Within a
year the women began giving birth to the children of their rapist captors.
Things being as they may, some of the women came to accept the men who took
them as wives, but others were not so lucky. For the unlucky ones no love
was in the man they lived with. No kindness existed in his heart, and no
interest existed in him for her. He wanted progeny and he wanted a slave,
and he got both through brutality and violence; not because brutality and
violence were necessary, but because brutality and violence gave him total
control.
These men devoid of love or kindness were single minded and driven by a
simple fact: they could exponentially increase their power and wealth
through the use of organized mass murder carried out on defenseless people
who were taken by surprise.
They perfected the art of this
psychopathic behavior over the course of many years and
countless attacks on villages and settlements none of which were ever
prepared to defend themselves against the slaughter and brutality these men
wrought.
This became their stock in trade and within two
generations an entire ideology developed wherein the practitioners of
organized mass murder deified and worshipped themselves and each other, with
the greatest respect going to the most brutal, most psychopathic and most
murderous among them.
These were the first CEO's, commonly
referred to as
kings.
They deified themselves before the people to
become the church, and the combination of king and church became
the state.
The rest is history.
It is also the present for little has changed in
the ways of men who to this day continue to profit through the mass
slaughtering of innocents and the plundering of their lands. Today it has
become more sophisticated only in that they have been able to convince
others to go and do the slaughtering for them and bring the plunder back to
the
CEOs.
The weapons have evolved with the development of
technology, but in the end they do the same as their earliest counterparts,
they kill innocent people as quickly as they can be wielded. They kill more
people with increasingly less effort every passing decade.
The expense of creating these modern weapons to stock the armed forces that
use them is far beyond need or justification because the CEOs long ago knew
how to profit from that too. They own the vast enterprises that build the
war camps, and which manufacture and sell the weapons that are used to
perpetrate the genocide and theft of resources all over the world.
They don't fund a penny of it and they never
have to get their own hands dirty. Their own lives are never in danger. It
is all done for them, at no cost to them and at no risk to them whatsoever.
It is we they convince to do their slaughter for them, pay for it all, and
take every risk and loss unto ourselves.
Today's most powerful CEOs aren't much different from their earliest
embodiment. They are no less dangerous.
Their attire has changed from animal skins and
fearsome masks, to tailored suits and silk ties. No longer on horseback they
now ride in limousines to boardrooms and back rooms to claim their
victories, engaging in brutal tactics that continue to decimate millions of
lives in their endless drive for more wealth and more power.
Today they are able to walk among us
unrecognized for they have mastered the fine arts of subterfuge and
psychological manipulation to the point of gaining and maintaining total
control over the minds of people everywhere.
Are they to be commended for their achievements?
They would contend that their superior ability
to kill, deceive and enslave mankind deserves high recognition and that
because of their brutality and dishonesty they are the superiors of all men.
But today, just like thousands of years ago they would be wrong to make such
a claim, and they know that. That is why they dare not speak such things
where others could hear them and recognize them for who and what they are.
What they are is the greatest evolution of
human evil this world has ever known.
They embody and inspire every vile potential of
mankind.
It takes no talent whatsoever, no thought, higher or otherwise, no
particular intellect and no effort to be driven by greed and lusts and to
live without compassion for others. Blunt force murder is the failure of
mankind, not its apex.
The CEOs, the state, are deceiving themselves as
much as they are deceiving this world. They are Earth's slow children,
retarded in moral development, the most truly disabled among us, for these
men have no souls and so they can never be whole.
They would be pitiable but the nature of their
disease makes them singularly difficult to feel any pity for.
FORCED IDEOLOGY IS
TOTAL CONTROL
The propaganda of war mongers has bled deeply into the fabric of our
culture and has for hundreds of years been successfully used to bring
citizens to their feet and willing to go off to fight their desired wars.
The looting and plundering is the primary goal, the theft of the wealth of
others.
But this is never told to the people they lie
into blind cooperation. Other stories are told, often complex and compelling
stories that instill fear in the public.
Fear is the primary motivating tool
behind war, the most effective tool in the propaganda arsenal.
Depictions of foreign strangers as monstrous enemies with inhuman traits and
offensive belief systems are the meat of the feast of successful war
propaganda, and no substantial evidence to support the claims of imminent
doom is asked for or provided. The claims usually defy logic and facts but
are crafted with such great expertise, the tellers are able to mix opposing
ideas into good sounding excuses for war.
The Holy War is an example of this mixing
of opposites, and patriotism is a concept used to manipulate the emotions of
the masses. Propaganda is profoundly effective and that is why it is the
first step to waging any war.
Without it, there would be no chance that people
anywhere would be moved to kill anyone.
If you doubt that modern wars are fought for the purpose of gaining
wealth and power for the few at the expense of the many, then answer
these questions.
-
Why is war the most profitable business
there is?
-
Why isn't profiting from war held in
utter disregard?
-
Why isn't it illegal?
-
If the reasons for war are so very pure
and noble then why do the same ranks of individuals always become so
incredibly wealthy war after war after war?
-
If there was not a penny to be made in
war, would we still go off to fight them?
It is after all you and I who pays for war with
our money and our lives.
Our hard earned dollars are directly transferred
from our pockets to the pockets of wealthy men with our government serving
as the enforcing agent. We have no choice but to pay. It is the high level
officials who call for war, and who more and more are the very same men who
head up the major corporate entities, including the corporate media, that
profit so abundantly from war.
Take the money away, take the profits away, take
the media's relentless war propagandizing away, make war profiteering
illegal and reduce profits from war to mere pennies and just see how much
war would be waged.
The greed and brutality of
a
small class of people make up the foundation the rest of society
is built on. They are always at the top, and we are always at the bottom.
They are always in the position to make and enforce all of the rules, and we
are not allowed to break them. They take our money at gunpoint and we are
not allowed to refuse to fund their endless capital ventures.
We do all of the work, pay for everything, they
get rich, and we get a paycheck that is only a bare fraction of our fair
share of the wealth we create. They keep it. And they keep taking more,
getting stronger, and we keep losing our just share of power, wealth and
prosperity.
Unless and until we can see this, it will continue. It will keep getting
worse and we will keep suffering as they keep gaining what they so endlessly
desire.
All of the money, all of the power, all of the
control over all of us, that is, those of us they decide to let live.
A DIFFERENT WORLD
Without these violent greedy war mongers deciding our fates, we could
have a completely different world.
If it were up to us to determine our own fate,
to design our own world and future,
Would we have so much need for money when the
fact is that our birthright on this earth includes our entitlement to take
whatever we need for our lives from earth's abundant natural resources? We
don't have to destroy it to use it. We know perfectly well that destroying
our world is suicide.
There is no justifiable reason and no need for a small group of men to lay
claim to and hoard the massive natural wealth that belongs to everybody,
including future generations. There is no right for those who are obsessed
with greed and control to deprive us and coming generations of our
birthright, our share of a pristine healthy natural environment that we all
need to sustain our lives; or to preempt our ability to prosper and justly
participate in the shaping of our society and our own private lives.
The combination of arrogant indifference to others, limitless greed and the
use of overpowering violence is the most serious underlying disease of
mankind.
Sadly, even today there is no known cure for this cancerous disease of the
mind and soul.
Other than forcing strict constraints and strong
regulations on those infected and watching them like hawks every moment of
the day, there is little we can do to prevent their addictive penchant for
death and destruction. That is, unless we finally as a whole wake
up to the simple reality that we've all been deprived of our rightful lives,
our rightful chance to experience our own potential, and to define that
potential for ourselves.
We are captive and bound by laws that force us
to comply with the desires of the greedy and the violent. The propaganda
they spew keeps our minds entrapped. Freeing ourselves from their relentless
tactics and strategies that seek to frame our thoughts for us is essential.
Our thoughts must be our own or we will remain entrapped forever.
A world of peace, prosperity and plenty could exist without the dark,
powerful influences and manipulations of greedy, violent men, and that thing
we mindlessly refer to as war would never have come into existence without
them. They would have us thank them for that as if it were some great gift
to the world. It is not a gift, it is the greatest curse that ever was.
The recognition they truly deserve, should it ever come, will not be
gratitude. It will take the form of full exposure to the public of their
deceit, betrayal, manipulation and unfettered disdain for mankind. It would
be their complete undoing.
But that time will never come on its own, nor will it come by force. It can
only come about because we the people have changed ourselves, changed the
way we see the world, literally changed our old ways and habits that lead us
into mindless conformity and unwavering support for people and systems that
exist only to undermine us and cheat us, even to kill us.
It will come when we individually disconnect
ourselves from the raging rivers of propaganda and the many and various
glittering cult stars and personalities who talk up thundering storms about
freedom while in fact they are working to deprive us of that freedom, and
are doing so right before our unseeing eyes. It is we who have to wise up to
bring the insanity to an end.
We cannot change them and we cannot hope to
change the systems that control our lives unless we change ourselves first.
We must regain the ability to see ourselves as worthy and deserving of full
equity with the wealthy self-promoting cannibalistic classes that see us as
lesser beings. To the extent we accept their judgments of us is the
extent that we will continue to live life on our knees and on their selfish
terms.
We are their equals and they are not above any
one of us. They are no wiser, no better, and no more deserving than the
least of us. There should not even be a 'least of us'. That we cannot
understand that speaks to the depth of our own brainwashing and the
acceptance of the value systems that deprive us of what is our rightful fair
share of everything life has to offer.
When we hold the clear knowledge that power, greed and the desire to control
others is the eternal ongoing battle that always has and continues to define
our world, profoundly affecting everything and everyone in it, then we can
hope to bring about the changes we need. When we all comprehend that this
power struggle will never end, that the desire to bring about systems that
give the few all of the wealth and power at the expense of everyone else
will never go away, only then can we hope to bring a genuine end to the
repeating foundational theme of self-destruction on which everything else is
built.
The wars, injustice and suffering that keeps our
country stuck in self-defeating systems of mass belief, mass consumption and
mass indifference to the truth are the product of our refusal to see
ourselves and the systems that control us for what they really are.
Since that first attack on horseback to slaughter and control others the
world has never been free and it is not free now.
We believe we are free, but we are not and
never were.
Our ignorance of everything real and factual
keeps us believing something that simply is not true. We are more tightly
controlled than ever and that control is becoming ever more brutal. Our
choices are dwindling and the system itself is becoming impenetrable, making
itself our eternal master. The system seeks only to protect and perpetuate
itself, it is not interested in freedom or justice and if you simply break
any of their rules, even the most unjust of them you'll quickly find that
out.
Freedom will not come until the corporate/state
monopoly of control and the artifice of righteous violence in the name of
good is understood and finally rejected. That is what is meant by "Knowledge
is Power".
Our knowledge of the truth is what will reduce
the corrupt controllers to irrelevance, powerlessness and shame.
It is a choice. We can choose to know the truth and once we know
the truth we must live it and speak it.
We must rock the boat in order to break free of
the powerful grip of false beliefs that control the majority of our minds.
We must be willing to offend and disrupt in order to speak the truth, if
that's what it takes.
The truth must never be subordinate to
disapproving opinions, which in themselves are a potent tool of social
control. We must value real peace more than the instant gratification, the
false peace that comes from choosing to conform specifically to avoid the
necessary confrontations required to bring the truth back into public
discourse.
We must fearlessly, unapologetically question
everything, question authority and demand justice for the least of us
until there is no such thing as a least of us.
Our official overriding and controlling philosophy of depraved indifference,
vengeful self-superiority and criminality is sheer evil, and the seed of
that evil is something inside all of us. That must be recognized and we must
consciously choose to reject it. When we teach our children to recognize and
to remember what true evil really is and where it really comes from, then
and only then, can we hope to make this a country that is honestly committed
to making our highest principles a reality.
A world of justice, peace and
freedom will come about as soon as we start living in it.
We can do that anytime.
We can even do it now...
