Senator Ron Paul has introduced the Federal
Reserve Transparency Act of 2012 (HR459) to the upset of Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve
Bank.
In August, the House of Representatives passed 327
- 98 on a vote
which exceeded the necessary 2/3rd majority.
Paul, who is pushing for transparency in
Americas relationship with the Fed, said that Americans are,
sick and tired
of what happened in the bailout and where the wealthy got bailed out and the
poor lost their jobs and they lost their homes.
The Audit legislation will direct the Government
Accountability Office (GAO), which is an independent congressional agency,
to oversee a full review of the Feds monetary policy while conducting an
audit of them and their decisions will be turned over to the Federal Open
Market Committee.
In July, the first
audit of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) was published by
the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
According to Senator
Bernie Sanders:
As a result of this audit, we now know that
the Federal Reserve provided more than $16 trillion in total financial
assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in
the United States and throughout the world.
This is a clear case of
socialism for the rich and rugged, youre-on-your-own individualism for
everyone else.
During 2007-2010, the Federal Reserve banks
provided assistance of more than a trillion dollars in emergency loans
to stabilize the financial system.
A source in the Deutsche Bank
explained that in 2008 our financial and monetary system completely
collapsed and since that time the banking cartels have been propping up the
system to make it appear as if everything was fine.
In reality our stock
market and monetary systems are fake; meaning that there is nothing holding
them in place except the illusion that they have stabilized since the Stock
Market Crash nearly 5 years ago.
The Deutsche Bank informant says that the cause
for the bailout of the banks was a large sum of cash needed quickly to repay
China who had purchased large quantities of mortgage-backed securities that
went belly-up when the global scam was realized.
When China realized that
they had been duped into buying worthless securitized loans which would
never be repaid, they demanded the actual property instead.
The Chinese were
prepared to send their people to American shores to seize property as
allocated to them through the securitized loan contracts.
To stave this off, the American taxpayers were
coerced by former President
Bush and former US Treasury Secretary Hank
Paulson.
During that incident, the US Senate was told emphatically that they
had to approve a $700
billion bailout (below video) or else martial law would be implemented immediately:
That money was funneled through the Federal Reserve Bank and wired to China,
as well as other countries that were demanding repayment for the fraudulent
securitizations.
To further avert financial catastrophe, as well
as more debt or property seizure threats by the Chinese, the Euro was
imploded there by plunging most of the European countries into an
insurmountable free-fall for which they were never intended to recover.
All the money that those banks claimed they
needed to avert collapse was also sent to the Chinese to add to the
trillions of dollars lost during the burst of the housing bubble on the
global market.
The GAO audit states that this transfer of funds
from the FRBNY to the central Bank of China was an unusual and exigent
circumstance that warranted the emergency authority of the FRBNY.
Sanders points out that the FRBNY gave massive
amounts of money to foreign banks and multi-national corporations.
Sanders
said:
No agency of the United States government should be allowed to
bailout a foreign bank or corporation without the direct approval of
Congress and the president.
Under the guise of emergency loans waivers of
banking employees and private contractors were given kickbacks.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and member of the board of
directors of the FRBNY, was given an estimated $390 billion in aid from
the FRBNY.
In kind, JPMorgan Chase was used as a money laundering
institution during the mortgage-backed securities and derivatives scandal.
Dimon was given his seat on the Feds board in
2007. He has enjoyed his position throughout the financial crisis that his
and several other mega-banks have caused through irresponsible behavior on
the global stock market.
Senator Bernie Sanders, who has been calling for
a revision of the Fed, told
CNNs Wolf Blitzer,
The conflicts of interest are so apparent that
theyre laughable. Here you have the Fed, which is supposed to regulate Wall
Street. Then you have the CEO of the largest Wall Street company on the
board which [it] is supposed to be regulating. This is the fox guarding the
henhouse.
During the emergency loans and special
privileges given to JPMorgan Chase with the receipt of trillions of dollars
at near-zero interest rates,
Morgan Stanley was allocated a $108.4 million
no-bid contract to assist in the bailout of AIG.
Now, Morgan Stanley is falling apart and is
classified as insolvent as stocks become worthless on the
New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE).
They are selling off
non-core assets to reduce European exposure to hedge funds and failing
financial corporations because of their participation in the mortgage-backed
securities and derivatives debacle.
According to
Rick Wiles:
Im hearing rumors that another major
financial house is going to implode. In fact, the name Ive been given
is Morgan Stanley... Its going to be put on the sacrificial alter by
the financial elite.
