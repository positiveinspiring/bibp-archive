New
World Order Also Creating A Mythical Christ for the New Age
It is a creation of a myth for the
people of Rome to center on, much as is now being created by the efforts of
the
New World Order to establish a new religious order, a
One World religion
that all entities can use as a kind of compromise, whereby in time, the entity
know as Christ in the Christian mythology, and the entity known as Mohammed
and the entities of Eastern religions, from Buddha, to Confucius, to the various
different religious leaders of different religions of the world will all be
partially represented in a new composite.
Whether this will be the culmination
of a being known as the Antichrist for some, or the New Messiah for others,
is still to be determined, but it is much like that action of trying to bring
all religions together.
This Awareness indicates what occurred
in Rome was a political effort by Constantine to gather the energies of conflicting
religious groups and to bring them together to stop the warring and fighting
between these groups that was tearing Rome apart. The action of Constantine
was that he informed those religious leaders of the various warring sects
in Rome that if they did not come together and join in some kind of compromise
religion, their religion would not be recognized or legal in Rome, thus, most
of those came and put their best effort into giving their particular religious
dogma and values and their deity into the compromise that was formed which
became the
Holy Roman Catholic religion, "catholic" meaning "universal."
This Awareness indicates that in
this action, these entities were not totally satisfied. No one was completely
satisfied, but each had contributed part of their religion and they could
feel secure that their religion would be preserved, buried in the Christian
religion. The name Jesus was chosen as the name of the hero, or centerpiece
of the religion because it meant "Neither He nor She." It was a
neutral word.
Many
names including Zeus were Considered
There were those who had proposed
the name Zeus, but many objected because Zeus was a Greek God and the Romans
wanted nothing to do with Greek gods. Therefore they sought to find a Roman
name, or a name that was neutral, which Rome could use as its own god, and
the name that came eventually to the forefront was the name Jesus, or
Hesus
(pronounced heysoos) and it was a Hebrew term that meant "neither He
nor She." It was neutral.
The further name of Christ was originally
Christos. Hesus Christos and Christos meant the Clear One, or Enlightened
One, or Jesus the Enlightened One. The Christed entity had been traditionally
recognized long before this time. The Greek had a character whose name was
Krestus, and Krestus or krest meant the height or the top, and there were
the various other types of Christs.
There
Were Many "Christs" Prior to Jesus
There was a black Christ or Christed
One in certain cultures and other cultures had their version of the Christed
One. In India it was known as Krishna. This Awareness indicates that Krishna
is the Indian version of a Christed being. There were many Christs prior to
Jesus. The term was used even as far back as Atlantis, and therefore, when
they sought for a further defining term to call their new composite in the
new religion of Rome, the concept of Hesus Christos, Jesus the Christ was
the result and most entities could accept that because they had no hostility
toward either term.
The
Value of the Myth is Real but Historically is false
The value of the myth is absolutely
totally real, and its effect on entities is absolutely totally real, but the
historical aspects have been distorted so that when people speak of a shroud
that covered Jesus, even if it were the genuine shroud, it might actually
have been a shroud that covered someone else: Apollonius perhaps, or some
other entity who died upon a cross in the company of thousands of otherwise
who died upon the cross during that time.
This Awareness indicates there was
of course an entity whose name was Hesus and this entity came from Nazareth,
lived in the area of Nazareth, and therefore, there was an entity Jesus of
Nazareth who was one of the various entities in the composite; but much of
the information attributed to the composite was information relating to other
entities: Apollonius of Tyana for one, Krishna for another, and the Sun God
of the Roman sun worshippers Helios as another.
This Awareness indicates It
realizes this is extremely confusing to many people. It does not expect
entities to fully understand this, nor does It care whether entities
accept this. This Awareness is only dedicated to giving truth as it sees it
in response to questions asked.
Biblical
Miracles and Stories Came from Earlier Sources
This Awareness indicates the story
of the water in the well and washing the feet, and healing the blind man can
be found in earlier religious writings from other sources, other cultures
previous to the Christian story. These are documented in earlier cultural
writings from other areas of the world, and were included in the Christian
story as part of the total composite of a mythical creation that could serve
as a religion for the Roman people.
How
Jesus Survived the Crucification
This Awareness indicates it appears
that the story of Heysoos of Nazareth, that this entity had a following and
was the one who was crucified on the cross, that the entity Heysoos of Nazareth
in his sojourns had learned much from studying with Indian teachings. This
entity had learned, for example, the art of moving into suspended animation
and when the entity was crucified, he gave the appearance of being dead, by
moving into a state of suspended animation.
Once it was assumed that he was dead,
he was removed and placed into a tomb, and later resurrected. This Awareness
indicates that this is the entity who went with Mary Magdalene in the direction
of France and England. This Awareness indicates that the entity from
Tyana
went westward toward India and many of his experiences later were attributed
to, were associated with and reflections of the story of Christ, and therefore,
it was presumed that he was the Christ.
This Awareness indicates that in
understanding that these entities were each contributors to the story of Jesus
the Christ, one can see how there could be many different forms of evidence
of the Christ story continuing in different directions.
This Awareness indicates it would
also be possible for entities to trace Krishna through certain forms of evidence,
to suggest that Krishna had moved into the time known as the Christian era,
and had reincarnated and was indeed the entity Jesus the Christ.
The argument would be as such: There
is a great similarity between Krishna and Christ, therefore, because of these
and these and these events, it would imply that Krishna reincarnated and carried
on his work in the Holy Land during the time of early Rome.
This Awareness indicates that this
would appear to be some kind of evidence that some entities would accept and
further the belief that Krishna was an earlier incarnation of Jesus the Christ,
that is, unless it was understood that the story of Jesus was a composite
which included information that came from the story of Jesus of Nazareth,
information that came from the life of Apollonius of Tyana and other great
teachers that had been studied by those who put together the Christian doctrine.
