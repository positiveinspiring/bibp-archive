# Morsi and The Muslim Brotherhood Challenged in Egypt

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_muslimbrotherhood21.htm

Protesters ransack Muslim
Brotherhood offices across the country
as "Arab Spring" facade is
further exposed.
Riding upon a wave of Palestinian blood, Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi has opportunistically used the afterglow
of an alleged "ceasefire" he claims to have brokered between
Hamas and Israel to announce a sweeping power-grab many are calling
a "coup."
As a result, protests and attacks have been reported
across the country targeting the Muslim Brotherhood and its offices.
While we are told that in Egypt, "democracy" has prevailed resulting
in the ascent of
the Muslim
Brotherhood into power, the reality is
that the vast majority of Egyptians do not support the Muslim
Brotherhood, and the country itself is far from the sectarian
extremist cesspool it is portrayed as turning into.
Backlash against the Brotherhood. Despite
the Muslim Brotherhood's political success,
it represents a violent, loud, minority that
is quietly opposed by the vast majority of
not only Egyptians, but Arabs across North
Africa and the Middle East.
Its high level
of organization, immense funding provided by
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and even the West,
including Israel, allows it to perpetuate
itself in spite of its unpopularity, while
its violent tactics allow it to crush
dissent.
The Brotherhood is simply the best
funded, most organized, loudest, most violent and assertive
political movement in Egypt, with its opponents being divided,
co-opted, and scattered, hopelessly weak in comparison, despite
their numerical superiority.
The Muslim Brotherhood, despite its
performance at the polls, and like many prevailing political
movements around the globe (e.g.
the US and
Thailand), is in fact a minority.
The money and organizational skills the Brotherhood has, are owed to
their long standing support from the US, Israel, and its regional
partners through whom Western money and support is laundered -
namely Saudi Arabia and
Qatar.
Morsi and the Brotherhood, like Mohammed ElBaradei's
opposition movement in Egypt, are creations and political
manifestations of Western foreign policy and their regional,
hegemonic objectives.
Angry protesters have now risen up across the country, and while
fellow foreign collaborator ElBaradei attempts to pose as the face
of this opposition, it is clear that the protesters represent a much
larger and diverse segment of the population. With ElBaradei already
exposed and diminished politically, Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood
remain one of the West's last viable footholds in the country.
Morsi's fall would be a tremendous setback, one that ElBaradei will
be unlikely able to salvage.
And because Morsi's fall would be so catastrophic for his Western
sponsors and their overarching agenda, it should be expected that
extraordinary measures will be taken to ensure either he remains in
power, or that a suitable replacement takes over his office.
The
Brotherhood's "Credentials"
The Muslim Brotherhood is a faux-theocratic sectarian extremist
movement - a regional movement that transcends national borders.
It
is guilty of decades of violent discord not only in Egypt, but
across the Arab World and it has remained a serious threat to
secular systems from Algeria to Syria and back again.
Mohamed Morsi - hardly a "hardline
extremists" himself, he is the embodiment of the
absolute fraud that is the Muslim Brotherhood -
a leadership of
Western-educated,
Western-serving technocrats posing as "pious
Muslims" attempting to cultivate a base of
fanatical extremists prepared to intimidate
through violence the Brotherhood's opposition.
Failing that, they are prepared to use (and have
used) extreme violence to achieve their
political agenda.
Today, the Western press has decried Egyptian and Syrian efforts to
hem in these sectarian extremists, particularly in Syria where the
government was accused of having "massacred" armed Brotherhood
militants in Hama in 1982.
The constitutions of secular Arab nations
across Northern Africa and the Middle East,
including the newly
rewritten Syrian Constitution, have attempted to exclude
sectarian political parties, especially those with "regional"
affiliations to prevent the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda
affiliated political movements from ever coming into power.
And while sectarian extremists taking power in Egypt and attempting
to take power in Syria may seem like an imminent threat to Western
(including Israeli) interests - it in reality is a tremendous boon.
Morsi himself is by no means an "extremists" or an "Islamist."
He is
a US-educated technocrat who merely poses as "hardline" in order
to cultivate the fanatical support of the Brotherhood's rank and
file. Several of Morsi's children are even US citizens. Morsi will
gladly play the part of a sneering "anti-American," "anti-Israeli"
"Islamist," but in the end, no matter how far the act goes, he will
fulfill the West's agenda.
Already, despite a long campaign of feigned anti-American,
anti-Israeli propaganda during the Egyptian presidential run-up,
the Muslim Brotherhood has joined US, European,
and Israeli calls for "international" intervention in Syria.
Egypt has continued to collude with the West, even as it feigned
support for Gaza during its recent conflict with Israel.
Alongside
the CIA, Mossad, and the Persian Gulf State despots of Saudi Arabia
and Qatar, the Muslim Brotherhood's Syrian affiliates have been
funneling weapons, cash, and foreign fighters into Syria to fight
Wall Street, London, Riyadh, Doha, and Tel Aviv's proxy war.
In
a May 6, 2012 Reuters article it stated:
"Working
quietly, the Brotherhood has been financing Free Syrian Army
defectors based in Turkey and channeling money and supplies to
Syria, reviving their base among small Sunni farmers and middle
class Syrians, opposition sources say."
The Muslim Brotherhood was nearing
extinction in Syria before the latest unrest, and while Reuters
categorically fails in its report to explain the "how" behind the
Brotherhood's resurrection, it was revealed in a 2007 New Yorker
article titled, "The
Redirection" by Seymour Hersh.
The Brotherhood was being directly backed by the US and Israel who
were funneling support through the Saudis so as to not compromise
the "credibility" of the so-called "Islamic" movement.
Hersh
revealed that members of the Lebanese Saad Hariri clique, then led
by Fouad Siniora, had been the go-between for US planners and the
Syrian Muslim Brotherhood.
Hersh reports the Lebanese Hariri faction had met Dick Cheney in
Washington and relayed personally the importance of using the Muslim
Brotherhood in Syria in any move against the ruling government:
"[Walid] Jumblatt then told me
that he had met with Vice-President Cheney in Washington last
fall to discuss, among other issues, the possibility of
undermining Assad.
He and his colleagues advised Cheney that, if
the United States does try to move against Syria, members of the
Syrian Muslim Brotherhood would be the ones to talk to, Jumblatt said."
-The
Redirection, Seymour Hersh (2007)
The article would continue by explaining
how already in 2007, US and Saudi backing had begun benefiting the
Brotherhood:
"There is evidence that
the Administrations redirection strategy has already
benefitted the Brotherhood.
The Syrian National Salvation
Front is a coalition of opposition groups whose principal
members are a faction led by Abdul Halim Khaddam, a former
Syrian Vice-President who defected in 2005, and the
Brotherhood.
A former high-ranking C.I.A. officer told me,
The Americans have provided both political and financial
support. The Saudis are taking the lead with financial
support, but there is American involvement.
He said that Khaddam, who now lives in Paris, was getting money from
Saudi Arabia, with the knowledge of the White House. (In
2005, a delegation of the Fronts members met with officials
from the National Security Council, according to press
reports.)
A former White House official told me that the
Saudis had provided members of the Front with travel
documents."
-The
Redirection, Seymour Hersh (2007)
It was warned that such backing would
benefit the Brotherhood as a whole, not just in Syria, and could
effect public opinion even as far as in Egypt where a long battle
against the hardliners was fought in order to keep Egyptian
governance secular.
Clearly the Brotherhood did not spontaneously
rise back to power in Syria, it was resurrected by US, Israeli, and
Saudi cash, weapons and directives.
Likewise, its rise into power in Egypt was facilitated by
Western-backed and funded destabilization, sometimes referred to
as the "Arab Spring."
ElBaradei
Still Lies in Wait
Mohammed ElBaradei's own movement
eventually exposed him as an agent for Western interests.
His
fall from grace helped set the stage for Morsi's ascent into power.
It appears that ElBaradei and his movement are now attempting to
position themselves once again to cover the West's bases in the
event Morsi falls, sabotaging once again any real legitimate
opposition Egyptians attempt to rally together.
ElBaradei and his
Western trained, funded, and directed opposition movement
are currently leading one of several factions now in Egypt's streets
and have been gladly afforded publicity across the Western press.
ElBaradei,
despite frequent anti-Israeli rhetoric,
literally sat around the same table as the
Israeli president, the Israeli foreign minister,
and the governor of the Bank of Israel, as a
fellow board member and adviser to the
Wall Street-London funded International Crisis
Group.
ElBaradei and his Muslim Brotherhood
counterpart Morsi, play "good cop-bad cop"
versus the Egyptian people, both as clear agents
of Western corporate-financier interests.
It should be remembered that like the Muslim Brotherhood,
ElBaradei
directly represents Western interests.
ElBaradei himself is a board
member of the Wall Street-London funded
International Crisis Group,
which features,
-
US
financiers like
George Soros and Larry Summers
-
Neo-Conservative
warmongers like Richard Armitage and Kenneth Adelman
-
perhaps
more inexplicable considering ElBaradei's feigned "anti-Israeli"
rhetoric, the
President of Israel, Shimon Peres, former Foreign Minister of
Israel Shlomo Ben-Ami, and Stanley Fischer, the governor of the Bank
of Israel
Like the Brotherhood, ElBaradei's rise to political power was made
possible by a movement trained, funded, and directed by the US
government and organizations such as the US Congress-funded National
Endowment for Democracy, years before the "Arab Spring" would
actually unfold.
In an April 2011 article published by the New York Times titled, "U.S.
Groups Helped Nurture Arab Uprisings," it was stated:
"A number of the groups and
individuals directly involved in the revolts and reforms
sweeping the region, including the April 6 Youth Movement in
Egypt, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights and grass-roots
activists like Entsar Qadhi, a youth leader in Yemen, received
training and financing from groups like the International
Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute and
Freedom House, a nonprofit human rights organization based in
Washington."
The article would also add, regarding
the US State Department-funded National Endowment for Democracy
(NED):
"The Republican and Democratic
institutes are loosely affiliated with the Republican and
Democratic Parties. They were created by Congress and are
financed through the National Endowment for Democracy, which was
set up in 1983 to channel grants for promoting democracy in
developing nations.
The National Endowment receives about $100
million annually from Congress. Freedom House also gets the bulk
of its money from the American government, mainly from the State
Department. "
In 2008, Egyptian activists from the
above mentioned April 6 movement were in New York City for
the
inaugural Alliance of Youth Movements (AYM) summit, also known
as Movements.org.
There, they received training, networking
opportunities, and support from AYM's
various corporate
and US governmental sponsors, including the US State Department
itself.
Shortly afterward, April 6 would travel to Serbia to train under
US-funded
CANVAS, formally the US-funded NGO "Otpor" who helped overthrow
the government of Serbia in 2000.
Otpor, the
New York Times would report, was a "well-oiled movement backed
by several million dollars from the United States." After its
success it would change its name to CANVAS and begin training
activists to be used in other US-backed regime change operations.
The April 6 Movement, after training with CANVAS, would return to
Egypt in 2010, a full year before the "Arab Spring," along with UN
IAEA Chief Mohammed ElBaradei.
April 6 members would even be arrested while waiting for
ElBaradei's arrival at Cairo's airport in mid-February.
Already, ElBaradei, as early as 2010, announced his intentions of running for
president in the 2011 elections.
Together with April 6,
Wael Ghonim of Google, and a coalition of other opposition
parties, ElBaradei assembled his "National
Front for Change" and began preparing for the coming "Arab
Spring" where his more presentable "pro-democracy" front would cover
for large masses of Muslim Brotherhood followers in Tahrir Square as
well as violence the Brotherhood carried out nationwide before the
fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
While the Western press attempts to portray Elbaradei and the Muslim
Brotherhood as opponents, they are in reality complementary - a
Western-backed, "good cop-bad cop" routine attempting to control
both ends of Egypt's political spectrum.
Caution as
Opposition Builds Vs. the Muslim Brotherhood
Clearly, both the Brotherhood and ElBaradei represent neither the
people of Egypt, nor Egypt's best interests.
In the coming days,
weeks, and months, as the Muslim Brotherhood faces increased
opposition, Egyptians and onlookers around the world must carefully
examine and delineate between the different opposition groups coming
forward to challenge the current ruling government and ensure that
real opposition prevails, while collaborators like ElBaradei are
exposed and sidelined.
There is real, legitimate opposition in Egypt, and it is essential
that is avoids the common tricks used to neutralize and subdue
legitimate activism.
Those falling into ElBaradei's camp must
recognize that while their intentions may be noble, the movement
they are helping hold aloft is not, and stands opposed to their very
political convictions and future aspirations.
Those amongst the Muslim Brotherhood's supporters must sincerely ask
themselves why, for decades, their leaders' ambitions have
consistently and "conveniently" dovetailed with Western designs
against real progress in the Arab World.
