Little is known of Shamballa except by Members of the Hierarchy to Whom that center is the goal in the same way that the Hierarchy is, at this time, the goal for humanity. Shamballa is the directing center for the Hierarchy. Little is really known of the will of God except by Those Whose function it is to interpret and express that will through love, intelligently applied. They know what the immediate purpose is and Their major occupation is the working out of that will into manifestation.
We have, therefore, three great centers and from them emanate three types of energy which are taking form as the three governing ideologies in the consciousness of the race. Old ideologies still persist; subsidiary schools of thought are everywhere to be found; distorted interpretations and travesties of reality abound on every hand; on all sides the dead level of the people (the ignorant masses) is played upon by these energies and men become victims of the exponents of the ideologies - past, present and future.
