UPDATE:
Heres the link for my portion of the BBC Newshour
segment in which I was interviewed about the Israeli
government document.
The entire program, which includes
a number of other segments discussing and analyzing the
document is here below:
Israelis are posting a claim
that the document I published is identical to a
post published by Fresh, an
Israeli gossip/news portal, a few days ago.
It is not.
My original
IDF source
leaked the post to a Fresh member and me at the same
time. That person published a small portion of the
original memo at Fresh, embellishing it with much
material that was meant to disguise what it was and
where it came from.
I cant ascribe motives to
whoever published it at Fresh, but much of it fantasy
and isnt in the original document.
This story is now a
screaming headline in the Israeli
media and at no point has anyone in
the Israeli government maintained that this document is
anything other than what I claim it to be.
They know it
is authentic.
Anyone else who claims
otherwise does so at the risk of their own credibility
(if they have any).
In the past few days, I
received an Israeli briefing document outlining Israels
war plans against Iran. The document was passed to me by
a high-level Israeli source who received it from an IDF
officer.
My source, in fact, wrote to
me that normally he would not leak this sort of
document, but:
These are not normal times.
Im afraid Bibi and Barak are dead serious.
The reason they leaked it is to expose the arguments and
plans advanced by the Bibi-Barak two-headed warrior.
Neither the IDF leaker, my source, nor virtually any senior
military or intelligence officer wants this war. While
whoever wrote this briefing paper had use of IDF and
intelligence data, I dont believe the IDF wrote it. It
feels more likely it came from the shop of national security
advisor Yaakov Amidror, a former general, settler
true-believer and Bibi confidant. It could also have been
produced by Defense Minister Barak, another pro-war booster.
Ive translated the document from Hebrew with the help of
Dena Shunra.
Before laying out the document, I wanted to place it in
context.
If youve
been reading this blog youll know that after
Bibis IDF service he became the
marketing director for a furniture company.
Recent revelations have suggested that he may
have also served in some capacity either formally or informally in the
Mossad during that period.
This document is a more sophisticated version of
selling bedroom sets and three-piece sectionals. The only difference is that
this marketing effort could lead to the death of thousands.
This is Bibis sales pitch for war. Its purpose
is to be used in meetings with members of the Shminiya , the
eight-member security cabinet which currently finds a 4-3 majority opposed
to an Iran strike.
Bibi uses this sales pitch to persuade the recalcitrant
ministers of the cool, clean, refreshing taste of war. My source informs me
that it has also been shared in confidence with selected journalists who are
in the trusted inner media circle (who, oh who, might they be?).
This is
Shock and Awe, Israel-style. It is Bibis effort to persuade high-level
Israeli officials that Israel can prosecute a pure technology war that
involves relatively few human beings (Israeli, that is) who may be put in
harms way, and will certainly cost few lives of IDF personnel.
Bibis sleight of hand here involves no mention
whatsoever of an Iranian counter-attack against Israel. The presumption must
be that the bells and whistles of all those marvelous new weapons systems
will decapitate Irans war-making ability and render it paralyzed. The
likelihood of this actually happening is nearly nil.
There will be those who will dispute the
authenticity of this document. Im convinced it is what my source claims,
based on his prior track record and the level of specificity offered in the
document. It references cities by name and the facilities they contain. It
names new weapons systems including one Israel supposedly hasnt even shared
with the U.S.
No, its real. Or I should say that while its
real, it is the product of the Israeli dream factory which manufactures
threats and then creates fabulist military strategies to address them. The
dream factory always breaks the hearts of the families of those whose
members fall victim to it.
It never produces the result it promises, nor
will it do so here.
-
Remember Bush-era Shock and Awe?
-
Remember those
promises of precision-guided cruise missiles raining death upon Saddam
Husseins Iraq?
-
Remember Bushs Mission Accomplished ceremony on the deck
of the USS Lincoln, only six or seven years premature?
-
Remember the promises
of decisive victory?
-
Remember 4,000 U.S. dead, not to mention hundreds of
thousands of Iraqis?
Now, think of what an Israeli war against Iran
could turn into.
Think about how this sanitized version of 21st century war
could turn into a protracted, bloody conflict closer to the nine-year
Iran-Iraq War:
The Israeli attack will open with a
coordinated strike, including an unprecedented cyber-attack which will
totally paralyze the Iranian regime and its ability to know what is
happening within its borders.
The internet, telephones, radio and
television, communications satellites, and fiber optic cables leading to
and from critical installations - including underground missile bases at Khorramabad and Isfahan
- will be taken out of action.
The electrical
grid throughout Iran will be paralyzed and transformer stations will
absorb severe damage from carbon fiber munitions which are finer than a
human hair, causing electrical short circuits whose repair requires
their complete removal. This would be a Sisyphean task in light of
cluster munitions which would be dropped, some time-delayed and some
remote-activated through the use of a satellite signal.
A barrage of tens of ballistic missiles
would be launched from Israel toward Iran.
300km ballistic missiles
would be launched from Israeli submarines in the vicinity of the Persian
Gulf. The missiles would not be armed with unconventional warheads
[WMD], but rather with high-explosive ordnance equipped with reinforced
tips designed specially to penetrate hardened targets.
The missiles will strike their targets - some
exploding above ground like those striking the nuclear reactor at Arak - which is intended to produce plutonium and tritium
- and the nearby
heavy water production facility; the nuclear fuel production facilities
at Isfahan and facilities for enriching uranium-hexaflouride. Others
would explode under-ground, as at the Fordo facility.
A barrage of hundreds of cruise missiles
will pound command and control systems, research and development
facilities, and the residences of senior personnel in the nuclear and
missile development apparatus.
Intelligence gathered over years will be
utilized to completely decapitate Irans professional and command ranks
in these fields.
After the first wave of attacks, which will
be timed to the second, the Blue
and White radar satellite, whose systems enable us to perform an
evaluation of the level of damage done to the various targets, will pass
over Iran. Only after rapidly decrypting the satellites data, will the
information be transferred directly to war planes making their way
covertly toward Iran.
These IAF planes will be armed with electronic
warfare gear previously unknown to the wider public, not even revealed
to our U.S. ally.
This equipment will render Israeli aircraft
invisible. Those Israeli war planes which participate in the attack
will damage a short-list of targets which require further assault.
Among the targets approved for attack -
Shihab
3 and Sejil ballistic missile silos, storage tanks for chemical
components of rocket fuel, industrial facilities for producing missile
control systems, centrifuge production plants and more.

briefing document on Iran attack
Origin
While the level of specificity in this document
is, in some senses, impressive, in one critical aspect it is deficient.
Muhammad Sahimi points out that the current chief of the Revolutionary
Guards, when he assumed his position in 2007, deliberately addressed the
issue of over-centralization of command and control by dividing the nation
into 31 districts. Each of these has its own independent command and
control facilities and mechanisms.
So Israel wouldnt be able to knock out
a single facility and paralyze
the IRG. Theyd need to knock out 31
separate sets of facilities - a much harder task.
There seems also to be an assumption that Irans
leaders and nuclear specialists live nice domestic lives and that Israeli
intelligence knows where they all live and can easily target them. In
truth, the most senior Iranian military and scientific figures live
clandestine lives and its hard for me to believe even the Mossad knows
where they are and how to target them.
So it appears that Netanyahu believes hes
fighting Saddam circa 2003.
During that war, the Iraqi Revolutionary Guards
were centralized and knocking out one C&C center could
decapitate the entire military apparatus. But Iran has learned from
Saddams mistakes. It isnt fighting the last war as Bibi appears to be. It is preparing for the next one.
While Israel may have new tricks up its
sleeve that no one in the world has yet seen, if it doesnt understand the
nature of the enemy, its defenses, its structure, etc. then it cant win.
