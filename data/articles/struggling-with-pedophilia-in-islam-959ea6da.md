While
the Pope is struggling hard with the problems of pedophilia in the
Catholic church, and is now quite forthcoming in facing it and taking
responsibility, pedophilia is still a minefield in Islam.
While not a problem exclusive to Islam, it is worthwhile to look at the
ideological challenges in stopping this practice and helping women in
Islamic countries to become free. This piece will explore some of the
theoretical problems.
But first, a song.
From
FaithFreedom.org:
They try to tell me my religion is wrong
They try to tell me to follow Islam
They said their prophet was a righteous dude
But I found out none of their words were true
Fair enough. He's been in touch with Muslims, who wanted him to join their
side, claiming their prophet was good. He checked the facts and found them
lying. That happens.
As in Quran 5:101-102, checking the facts frequently
make people want to leave.
I read the Quran and I read the hadith
These are decent sources! No second-hand interpretation here,
just the
originals.
And the sickness of Muhammad was apparent to me
Oops... Interestingly, non-Muslims who did the same
tend to agree. At least
he's frank about his conclusion.
He justified perversion in the name of Allah
When he married a girl too young for a bra
This is one of the most troubling items in all of Islam.
Its founder
Qutham
(later named Muhammad - The praised one) did
marry a
girl too young for a
bra. It's in the scripture (the finest Bukhari and the others) and can't
just be explained away.
She was playing with dolls when the prophet came
Her childhood was stolen in Allahs name
Aisha was nine when he took her to bed
As documented in Bukhari and other places in the Islamic scripture, this is
canonically correct. A summary with exact references is at
Faithfreedom.org.
That's not good.
'Prophets' are usually (as in Quran 33:21) considered good examples that
their followers are supposed to, well, follow. And that goes hook, line and
sinker no exceptions permitted. The evidence in the hadith is extensive.
Muhammad really "did" consider his actions justified by Allah. And anyone
not considering pedophilia to be perverse ought to have his head examined.
Which leaves the believer with two logical options:
-
Pedophilia is, under certain circumstances,
justified.
-
Muhammad was a pervert.
The second is hardly an option, for having this opinion about Muhammad would
lead to
apostacy, and the believer would become an
unbeliever. This,
logically, leaves the believers to be stick with option (1), at least in
principle.
Dont tell me that fools not sick in the head
That's a harsh statement. Muhammad is (implicitly) called a 'fool', and
'sick in the head'. But what differentiates Muhammad from others who have
sex with girls the age of 9? Would anyone argue against calling pedophiles
'sick' and 'fools'? Well, the great difference here is that Muhammad is
thought to be 'holy'.
And thus be an example for mankind.
Ehm, that wasn't much better. One thing is to have sex with underage girls,
a crime frowned strongly upon in the West. But extending this from just a
personal, eh, habit, to be suggested behavior for others is much worse.
Aint gonna follow no child molester, sex offender, prophet pretender
Here's the chorus. Of course sensible humans don't follow the example of
child molesters. That'd be rather sick.
The 'prophet pretender' bit may
refer to the fact that Muhammad never gave a single prophecy, presented a
miracle or in general came up with anything more religious than a collection
of what he said was from Allah (the Quran) and what he said and did under
his own responsibility. (the Sirat / hadith).
The claim to prophethood comes
from his first wife Khadija, after Muhammad had an unpleasant encounter with...
something in a cave.
Ain't gonna follow no child molester,
Islam is not for me.
Islam is not for me.
It's quite bad so far.
And while it can be argued that this was common on
the life of Muhammad, the problem is that his 'religious' example
sanctions this as permissible behavior for time unlimited. How can a
religion fix the problem of having a founder fond of little girls?
Through
more than a millennium, this example of 'holy' behavior is fundamentally
uncontested and still being used:
The sickness of the Islamic mind
Has caused the Mullahs to be blind
This just might be a reference to
Khomeini, who is still considered a hero
among Shia Muslims, and in his book
Tahrirolvasyleh (Vol. 4) wrote:
A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby. However he
should not penetrate, sodomising the child is OK. If the man penetrates and
damages the child then he should be responsible for her subsistence
throughout her life. This girl, however does not count as one of his four
permanent wives. The man will not be eligible to marry the girls sister.
This is sick.
He continues, and this bears relevance to practices today:
It is better for a girl to marry in such a time when she would begin
menstruation at her husband's house rather than her father's home. Any
father marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven.
Not only does he openly advocate marrying away girls before they reach
puberty. He even gives a free pass to heaven for what by sane people is
considered deeply criminal.
To justify their prophet they would justify sin
So the sins of the prophet are repeated again
An apt way of describing the problem of having a 'prophet' who
plunders
caravans, hates Jews with a vengeance and
kills infidels and critics.
Jihadists today have a source of inspiration without parallel.
This paradox is at the heart of Islam and its struggle to reform into
modernity. Muhammad committed and encouraged deeds which today would be
considered deeply criminal. He abandoned, in word and in practice, the Ten
Commandments that have served Jews and Christians so well through millennia,
giving no firm system of ethics and limits of behavior to replace them.
Many statements, rules and examples - so many that the believers, in many
realms of life, have a very wide range of permissible actions. That can be
quite bad, but worse is the fact that there is no clearly given divine
condemnation of anti-Semitism,
killing of 'infidels'
in
Jihad or, as we are
looking at here, pedophilia.
The wide selection of usable quotes for either purpose absolves the peaceful
Muslim from blame over what the violent Muslims does in the name of his
religion, and absolves the violent Muslim from blame over what he does.
This
is a problem we are facing very frequently when asking Islamic leaders to
condemn crimes, terrorism and other barbaric behavior in the name of Islam.
All over the world in Islamic states
9 year old girls suffer cruel fate
This, unfortunately, is true.
International Center for Research on Women
estimates a whopping 51 million child brides on the planet today. That's a
LOT! And Islamic states, unfortunately, lead the stats in this area. Read
more in their report
Too Young to Wed.
For Video 'click' below image:
Sold into marriage to twisted men
And Aishas sad story is repeated again
It is. Fortunately, some get out of their situation.
A highly publicized
case is that of 8-year old
Nojoud being forced into marriage with a man 20
years her senior. Let down by her entire family and all people of informal
influence, she decided herself to walk up to the court house and demand a
divorce from her violent and raping husband. To the surprise of everyone,
she got it.
Unfortunately that was not granted merely on grounds of her inalienable
right to decide over her own body. The divorce also included an anonymous
donor paying her husband YR 100,000 to let her go. The case thus includes an
element of purchasing child brides, which would then rationally be
considered sex slaves.
Not good, and goes to prove the point in the song,
too.
Aint gonna follow no child molester, sex offender, prophet pretender.
Ain't gonna follow no child molester,
Islam is not for me.
Islam is not for me
Chorus repeat.
Islam sure didn't do anything
constructive for under-age women
yet.
Do you care about women all over the world?
Do you care about those little girls?
Decent human beings should do.
Then stand up and fight for human rights
Speak out against the laws of Islam
Well, do we have a choice? Of course we do!
We can bang away at
our
PlayStation or other game machine, spend our time with the fantasy world of
Hollywood, or look for the highest profits to impress our neighbors or
women. All very fine, and short-sighted.
What really matters, in the long run, is to do things that will benefit
others, in the real world. Not in some imaginary Paradise, not in some
well-designed adventure game.
In the real world, where people live, breathe
and unfortunately suffer.
Aint gonna follow no child molester, sex offender, prophet pretender.
Ain't gonna follow no child molester,
Islam is not for me.
Islam is not for me.
Islam is not for me.
Well, Islam sure didn't do very well, so far. There's one peculiar item that
needs to be addressed too, the
practice of
stoning.
For Video, "click" below image:
There are different ways to address this:
-
You may support it, like
Tariq Ramadan, who for the time being recommends a
moratorium on the practice in order to not offend the West and human rights
activists.
-
Or you may ignore the problem, assuming that no sane human being would ever
tolerate the
practice.
-
Or you may decide to support the efforts to
Stop Stoning Forever.
As above, the choice is open.
What is truly puzzling, however, is that fundamentalistic Islam advocates
the
stoning to
death adults who commit the 'crime' of illegal love (as if
the tribe or the state should control love!), while the very real crime of
pedophilia carries no punishment at all, merely regulations on it.
One of these is
Sura 65:4 (watch below video), which prescribes a 3-months waiting period for
divorcing women, and explicitly includes women too young to menstruate.
The
practice of pedophilia is simply taken for granted in this ancient text.
Islam: How to Divorce Your Muslim Child Bride - The
Rules
Again, probably a standard feature of the strongly male-dominated ancient
Arabia.
The problem, of course, is that material like this protects pedophiles
today, and there is no obvious 'religious' solution - that is, strong
scriptural evidence usable to stand "against" pedophilia. Not that it has
not been tried, and fortunately many Islamic leaders do the Right Thing and
condemn pedophilia.
This introduces a paradox, however.
Some Islamic leaders, like in the
YouTube video on Sura 65:4 above, condemn pedophiles to burn in Hell. In
that interpretation. Muhammad would be burned in Hell for his acts against
Aisha. That leads to more trouble. Sura 33:21 recommends to follow the
example of Muhammad for anyone wanting to be with him and Allah on the Last
Day.
Now, suppose that place is actually... Hell?
Condemning pedophiles to Hell
(which makes sense) would imply that, and it's corroborated by the fact that
Allah is never, ever in the Islamic scripture described as being in
Paradise. Several mentions of him in Hell can be found, in some cases even
feeding the fires of Hell with the bodies of those who do not believe in
him.
I, for one, believe that pedophiles belong in Hell.
The logical problems
that Islam faces on this issue are significant, and a logical conclusion to
the dilemmas are hard to find, not least given the explicit nature of
Islamic scripture on the matter. Talking of Islamic scripture, it would seem
that Islam simply adopted the pre-Islamic practices in the area, thus
carving the tolerance of pedophilia that existed in ancient Arabia into
stone, forever.
Most Islamic leaders tend to ignore this problem, preferring instead bitch
about how we in the West do not respect the holy nature of Islam and keep
attacking it. But unless they face up to serious problems like this, how can
they ever expect respect by decent human beings?
We can respect that the Muslims have the right to consider anything and
everything in their scripture to be 'holy', but they can not expect us to
share that notion. Particular not on explicitly unholy matters like these.
Can Islam be fixed?
I have no authority whatsoever to pass judgment on this.
But it would seem that fixing it would require a serious lobotomy of
the
scripture itself, thereby opening the floodgates of revisionism on all sorts
of difficult subjects, potentially even destroying the notion that anything
in these books is actually holy, in any meaningful understanding of the
word.
As a matter of personal opinion, I doubt that a religious fix exist. At
least in this area.
But I am open to be proven wrong.
