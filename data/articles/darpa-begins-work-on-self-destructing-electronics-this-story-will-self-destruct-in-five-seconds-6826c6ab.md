# DARPA Begins Work on Self-Destructing Electronics - 'This Story Will 
Self-Destruct in Five Seconds...'

DARPA, the United States' military research agency,
has announced its intention to fund and develop technology that
self-destructs.
For example, DARPA would like a high-resolution
camera sensor self-destructs when it receives a certain radio signal from
military command, preventing it from being used by the enemy.
Other methods of self destruction are also being
investigated, though, such as technology that degrades quickly under certain
conditions - water, heat, stomach acid, and so on.
The governing idea behind the program, called
Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR), is that there's no point in the
US maintaining a technological advantage over the enemy if that technology
then falls into their hands.
If Iran shoots a drone out of the sky, there
could be all sorts of sensitive data and bleeding-edge technology that could
then be collected, analyzed, and reverse-engineered. In many cases, it would
then be trivial to develop countermeasures that completely nullify the US
military's advantage.
The US military reportedly has similar schemes
in place for rapidly disposing of documents and hard drives (thermite in an
armored box), but this program seems to be more interested in protecting
individual components and computers on a smaller scale.

would rather its enemies didn't get its hands on ultra-advanced tech,
like its 1.8-gigapixel
ARGUS surveillance system.
"The commercial off-the-shelf, or COTS,
electronics made for everyday purchases are durable and last nearly
forever," says DARPA's Alicia Jackson, the VAPR program manager.
"DARPA is looking for a way to make
electronics that last precisely as long as they are needed. The
breakdown of such devices could be triggered by a signal sent from
command or any number of possible environmental conditions, such as
temperature."
For example, a next-gen UAV might be equipped
with an ultra-high-res imaging sensor that self-destructs if it receives a
certain signal, or if it experiences greater-than-expected g-force (i.e. the
drone has been shot out of the sky and is now falling very quickly).
VAPR also will build upon DARPA's previous
research into biomedical implants that dissolve after a certain amount of
time (read 'DARPA
shows off 1.8-gigapixel surveillance drone, can spot a terrorist from 20,000
feet'.)

Impossible
It's interesting to consider whether this
program was triggered by a specific scenario, or whether it's just a random
idea that has bubbled to the fore.
Due to the exponential nature of technological
advances, it's entirely possible that the USA is now so far ahead that it
would be catastrophic to give the enemy a leg up.
Looking at the antiquated weapons that are
fielded by enemies of America the Great, and their lack of domestic
high-tech hardware manufacturing expertise, it's not too crazy to think that
the US is really that far ahead (read 'Meet
DARPA's real-world Terminator, Atlas'.)
Moving forward,
DARPA is seeking proposals from the industry of materials, manufacturing
processes, and design methodology that,
"will enable a revolutionary shift in
transient electronics capabilities."
The target of the program - to build a transient
biomedical sensor that's able to communicate with a remote user - is fairly
basic to begin with, but the underlying tech can then be used to build
self-destructing computer chips, memory chips, sensors, and so on.
