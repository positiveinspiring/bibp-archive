# Trump Wants to Break the EU - Will he Instead End Up Being its Savior?

Just when it
seemed like the European Union's troubles couldn't get any
worse, Donald Trump seemed to rub salt in its wounds last week.
In a joint interview with German newspaper Bild and
The Times of London, he lauded
Brexit, disparaged German
Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy, and
derided the EU as a "vehicle" for German economic domination.
Trump clearly would shed no tears were the union to collapse on
his watch. But could he instead end up being the EU's savior?
Trump's most recent comments
follow reported assurances given by the Trump transition
team to British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that the
U.S. would quickly put a generous bilateral free trade deal on
the table to strengthen London's hand in negotiating the terms
of Brexit with the EU.
After meeting
with Johnson in Washington, Sen. Robert Corker, once
floated as a potential Trump secretary of state nominee,
publicly declared that such a deal would be a high priority
in Washington.
According to Josh Green of Bloomberg, this is all
part of a plan hatched by Trump adviser Steve Bannon to
break up the EU by offering similar bilateral deals to each of
the union's weak-link member states until the edifice comes
crashing down.
Trump's
interview suggests that Green's reporting is more reality than
conspiracy theory.
Among Europeans, it's not uncommon to hear the EU's troubles
blamed on Washington's meddling. To hear them tell it, the U.S.,
hell-bent on undermining the EU for fear that it might develop
into a geopolitical rival and threat, plays its various members
against each other to keep the union divided and ineffective.
Of course, Europe has never needed America's help to remain
divided and ineffective.
But there has
always been an "American primacy" contingent in Washington that
viewed the EU with skepticism, disdaining Brussels' claims to
global leadership not through the hard power of military might,
but through the soft power of trade, norms and values.
Some even
advocated treating the EU as a rival and threat.
Trump's plan is their vision on steroids.
But true to
form, instead of seeing the EU as a political whole that is
greater than the sum of its economic parts, he sees it through a
distinctly mercantilist lens:
Its sole
purpose is to serve as a force-magnifier for German
industry,
"formed, partially, to beat the United States on trade,"
as he put it.
The EU
is
the geopolitical equivalent
of
Obamacare:
People love everything it does,
they just hate the name.
To be fair, the
same criticism has been leveled by Europeans, particularly in
Athens and elsewhere in Southern Europe at the height of the
Greek debt crisis.
And Trump is
hardly the first to criticize Merkel's refugee policy, whether
in Germany or Europe.
But will his plan backfire? In voicing his views so explicitly,
Trump actually puts flesh on the bones of what has long been a
straw man in Europe, namely the American conspiracy to undermine
the EU.
Far from a
baseless rumor, Trump not only clearly wants to undermine the
EU, he has cheered Brexit as the opening act of its demise. And
that could generate the kind of European solidarity that has
been in short supply in recent years and could tip the balance
in the EU's favor moving forward.
After all, its
one thing to talk about tearing your own house down, but quite
another for a perfect stranger to call in the wrecking ball
while you're still living in it.
The shock of the Brexit referendum combined with Trump's
election raised fears of similar upsets in upcoming national
elections in the Netherlands and France.
Far-right Europhobic
parties have been gaining traction in both countries, and their
victory would raise the risk of a chain reaction of core
founding member states beating a path to the exit.
Those scenarios are still a long shot in both countries,
however.
And while
a Pew Global Poll from before Brexit in June 2016 suggested
a rise in unfavorable views of the EU in some key member states
such as France, a majority still had a favorable view in the
Netherlands and Germany.
Moreover,
according to
the latest Eurobarometer poll from November, although only
35 percent of respondents had an overall positive image of the
EU, that still beat out those with an overall negative view of
the union, at 25 percent; 38 percent were neutral.
Another
interesting insight from the poll had to do with trust:
While
only 36 percent trusted the European Parliament, fewer still -
32 percent and 31 percent - trusted their national parliaments
and national governments, respectively.
Perhaps the most astonishing results pertain to particular EU
policies, where support grew since last spring and now ranges
from strong to overwhelming majorities on every issue polled,
including,
...with
one exception:
further
enlargement of the union.
In other words,
the EU is the geopolitical equivalent of Obamacare:
People love
everything it does, they just hate the name.
That suggests
that the EU might prove more durable than its doubters and
skeptics believe.
According to
Trump, "it's going to be very hard to keep it together cause people
are angry about it," but that's contradicted by the
Eurobarometer polling, which showed that, overall, a majority of
respondents were optimistic about the EU's future.
This is in part
because in many respects the EU has succeeded on its core
mission: maintaining peace among its members through the
establishment of deep and binding economic, political and
cultural links.
Not
surprisingly, these are also identified in the Eurobarometer
poll as the EU's most positive achievements.
But many of the EU's flaws, and especially the ones that help
make it unpopular outside of Brussels, are simply due to the
fact that it is a one-stop clearinghouse for all the
bureaucratic codification of rules, regulations and norms that
facilitate trade. And its worst failures are on issues that no
single member state could successfully manage on its own.
As I wrote back in October, for all the EU's political
errors - and they are legion - if it did not exist, it would
have to be invented.
While the goal of ever-closer union has lost favor - the Pew
poll found 42 percent in favor of devolving powers back to
national governments, versus only 19 percent in favor of
transferring more powers to the EU - the union itself has not.
And with
British Prime Minister Theresa May's government now
committed to negotiating a clean break from the EU, the most
destabilizing potential blow for Brussels may very well be
behind it.
A lot is still riding on the Dutch and French elections, but
Trump just might have tipped his hand too early. If what Europe
needed all these years was for someone to kick sand in its face,
he has effectively done so.
That won't make
all of the familiar obstacles to developing common EU policies
on defense, energy and migration - to name just a few -
magically disappear, but it could create the political will to
more effectively address them.
It's possible Trump is misguided enough to think that
dismantling the EU could benefit the U.S.
But by broadcasting
his project, he has made the need for a strong Europe an easier
sell than it's been in ages.
