If we can believe
Stratfor emails hacked by WikiLeaks, Israeli commandos and
covert operations have decimated Irans nuclear program, so there is no need
for an attack.
One email out a momentous five million mentions
a comment made by Israeli
Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who praised a deadly munitions explosion at a
military base run by Irans elite Revolutionary Guards.
Barak said,
it would be desirable if they multiply."
I think this is a diversion. The Israelis
already destroyed all the Iranian nuclear infrastructure on the ground
weeks ago, one Stratfor intelligence official
wrote in an email dated
November 14, 2011.
The current lets bomb Iran campaign was
ordered by the EU leaders to divert the public attention from their at
home financial problems. It plays also well for the US since Pakistan,
Russia and N. Korea are mentioned in the report.
Others at Stratfor arrived at a similar
conclusion:
Israeli commandos in collaboration with
Kurd forces destroyed few underground facilities mainly used for the
Iranian defense and nuclear research projects, another official wrote
on November 13, 2011.
Even if the Israelis have the capabilities and
are ready to attack by air, sea and land, there is no need to attack the
nuclear program at this point after the commandos destroyed a
significant part of it.
It seems unlikely EU officialdom would launch a
costly and controversial war as a diversion from eurozone financial
problems.
The attack has an ulterior motive.
In June of 2010, Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tuckers inside sources revealed that
many Bilderberg members, including prominent member
Zbigniew Brzezinski,
were in favor of U.S. air strikes on Iran and were leaning towards war,
although 100 per cent of members were not supportive of an attack.
Tucker named his source as an international financial consultant who
personally knows Bilderberg members and has done business with them for the
past 20 years, according to
an article by Paul Joseph Watson.
Some of them in Europe are saying no we
shouldnt do it but most of them are in favor of American air strikes on
Iran, said Tucker, adding, Theyre tilting heavily towards green
lighting a U.S. attack on Iran.
If covert operations have destroyed much of
Irans nuclear program, what would be the purpose of a conventional military
attack?
Irans fledgling and largely clumsy nuclear program takes a backseat to the
real target the globalists want to take out - the political leadership in
Iran and the countrys modern civilian infrastructure.
In November,
we reported on comments made by U.S. intelligence officials who
said Israels target list includes Irans electric grid, internet, cellphone
network, and emergency frequencies for firemen and police officers.
The existence of a program designed to cripple crucial civilian
infrastructure not related to Irans nuclear program reveals that the
Israeli-U.S. plan is to reduce the country to a Stone Age condition much the
same way Iraq was leveled in 2003.
Beginning in 1991 with
Bush Seniors illegal invasion, Iraqi civilians and
their infrastructure were deliberately targeted by the U.S. military.
The savage bombardment had a near apocalyptic
impact on Iraq and had transformed the country into a,
pre-industrial age nation, which had been
until January a rather highly urbanized and mechanized society,
writes
author William Blum, citing United Nations observations.
Bombing of Iraqi cities served no military purpose but was designed to
destroy the civilian infrastructure. War games in July 1990 in South
Carolina trained pilots to bomb civilian targets and Pentagon statements
about plans to bomb civilian targets in August and September 1990 are
evidence that these targets were set well in advance of January 15,
1991,
writes David Model in his book, Lying for Empire
- How to Commit
War Crimes With A Straight Face.
Critical elements of the civilian infrastructure were destroyed
including communication systems, oil refineries, electric generators,
water treatment facilities, dams, and transportation centers, Model
continues.
Over 90 percent of Iraqs electrical
capacity was destroyed in the first days of the bombing.
Iraqs water supply was
specifically targeted
and resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children.
Iraqs capacity to produce food was also
destroyed by attacks on agriculture, food processing, food storage and the
food distribution system. Half of Iraqs agricultural output depended on
irrigation systems which were also destroyed.
In addition to hundreds of hospitals, health centers, mosques and schools,
Bushs Pentagon bombed densely populated cities, killing thousands. Civilian
highway traffic was targeted and vehicles such as buses and cars were bombed
repeatedly.
Iran faces the same fate. The incessant warnings about Irans supposed
nuclear threat is smoke and mirrors - the real plan is not to de-nuke Iran,
but set it back and hundred years and make sure if does not challenge the
globalists little client state in the region, Israel.
If Stratfors intelligence is genuine, it adds more weight to the argument
that Israel and the United States are hyping Irans nuclear program and
using it as a cover for a generalized attack designed to level modern
Persian society and civilization.
In this way it serves the same purpose as Bushs yellowcake and aluminum
tubes - a flimsy pretext designed to cover for yet another series of war
crimes.
