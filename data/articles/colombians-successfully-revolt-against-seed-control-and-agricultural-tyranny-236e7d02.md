Will Colombia's farmers defeat the
economic hitmen of the agricultural industry?
Early in September, 2013, the Colombian
government was forced to partially concede to the demands of a nationwide
general strike instigated by farmers of the largely agrarian nation.
The
three week long protests and blockades that shut down much of the nation
were supported by thousands of miners, truckers, students, bus drivers, and
Colombian citizens, blocking roads and
clashing with police.
Close to 650 arrests were made, 485 injuries
were reported, 12 people killed, and over 600 cases of human rights
violations reported.
Coverage of the
nationwide protests feature rural peoples and urban demonstrators in the
typical contest against body-armor clad, state riot police armed with gas,
rubber bullets, flash-bang grenades and batons, beating people and
dispersing women and children in clouds of smoke.
The popular uprising was the result of poor
economic conditions coinciding with rising anger over agricultural law 9.70,
passed in 2010, which officially made it illegal to share, trade, or sell
native seeds amongst farmers, effectively criminalizing generations long
traditions of local and small scale agriculture.
A documentary film (below video) by
Victoria Salano featuring footage of the destruction of stocks of native
seeds by the government helped to inform the public and to catalyze the
movement to suspend law 9.70.
"There have to be controls which govern our
food sovereignty," states German Alonso Vélez.
"We should control which seeds are
introduced to the country and can harm local ones. We shouldn't be
persecuting the seeds which are native to our soil."

The current system, in place for many years now,
already forces farmers to annually purchase seed that is certified by the
country's agricultural institution, rather than allowing them to plant
native seed, presenting a severe financial burden to small-scale
cultivators.
Law 9.70, however, expanded this tyranny by criminalizing the
sharing and trading of native seeds, offering prison terms for this
customary practice.
This seems to have been the last straw for struggling
farmers who are appalled to see their heritage criminalized and eradicated
by their government working on behalf of
international corporate interests.
The seed control policies are forcing farmers to
plant genetically modified and patented seed, while ensuring dependence on
foreign seed imports and imported
pesticides, fertilizers and other chemicals.
For a nation that has
largely survived until now by using native seed, the lack of diversity in
imported varieties means that hundreds of years of local agricultural
development is being eradicated in exchange for an unaffordable farming
system based on genetically modified products seen by many as having severe
and wholly yet unknown health risks.
The reaction by such a large segment of the
public is reflective of the concern over a looming
food
crisis, as well as growing public awareness of the practices of the
monopolies governing Colombia's food system.
More people now understand the
root cause of the issue, international free-trade agreements and pressure
from agro-chemical giants, such as
Monsanto, which put international corporations in dominion over small
farmers by forcing them to buy imported products and services that have
never before been needed.
It is a usurpation of control over the most
important segment of the economy, food.
"It's no longer viable for a dairy farm to
make ends meet with three cows. Unless there are profound structural
changes to current development models, we will be totally dependent on
monopolies for food." - German Alonso Vélez
Implementation of seed control was described by
Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos as,
'having Colombia tuned up to
international reality.'
This statement is, of course, completely true.
The
trending international reality is exactly this, 'Trojan Horse' conquest of
national food sovereignty by means of international corporate/government
treaties and agreements sponsored by international governing bodies and the
bottomless coiffeurs of the companies that benefit directly from such trade
agreements.
The shift to this international model of farming
simply does not make economic or common sense for the people of most
nations.
Author and self-proclaimed 'economic hitman'
John Perkins wrote about this type of imperial foreign occupation by
corporate influence in his critical book, 'Confessions
of an Economic Hitman.'
It is the newest means of international
conquest.
"If government controls the use of seeds, it
controls what is planted, and what we end up eating." - Richard Emblem
The international drive toward the
monopolization of seed, the global reduction of seed diversity, and the
abolishment of small scale farming is being seen all over the world.
Earlier
this year the European Union presented the 'Plant Reproductive Material Law'
which originally aimed to limit the types of seeds an individual can plant
in their own backyard gardens to those approved by a bureaucratic agency.
In
the United States,
Roundup Ready alfalfa is 'accidentally' contaminating non-GMO acreage at
such a pace that non-GMO alfalfa may soon become a thing of the past.
Farmers are being driven out of business by the legal teams of large
corporations, and local municipalities and homeowner's associations are
fining homeowners for their gardens, and in some shocking cases, local farms
are being raided by SWAT teams for code violations and unsubstantiated
rumors.
The war against sovereign food is happening
right now, and the developments in Colombia serve as another example of the
unnecessary and unfair stresses that the international corporate model of
agricultural can put on a nation, it's farmers and it's economy.
In
opposition to this, worldwide there are campaigns to educate farmers about
the realities of
GMO-agriculture and also to inform the public of the other side of the
issue which points to unknown and suspected health risks of consuming GMO
foods, their dependence on
toxic pesticides and herbicides, the high costs of buying seed each
year, the loss of diversity.
"By privatizing our seeds we began eroding
our agricultural autonomy." - German Alonso Vélez
Most people simply don't yet understand how
important it is to retain food sovereignty, but this recent case from
Colombia gives us insight how quickly this issue can reach critical mass.
Some important conclusions that we can draw from these recent events in
Colombia are:
-
Food is the most important and unifying
social cause, and the primary issue to set off
civil unrest.
-
National labor strikes are more effective
than protest at forcing a dialogue on popular issues.
-
Monsanto and the bio-tech giants are not
invincible, and global momentum is gaining in opposition to this new
model of international genetically modified and chemically dependent
agriculture.
-
The 'free-trade' model of achieving
international conformity in agriculture is a new form of colonialism and
empire building. It criminalizes traditional and everyday activities in
order to render whole nations dependent on international imports.
-
Grass roots media and documentary films are
an exceptional means of educating people and exposing the corruption and
insanity of this model of agriculture.
The Colombian government's concession to suspend
law 9.70 and release all of those detained in the protests is an important
sign that people do still have a voice.
This story is far from over and time
alone will tell how this plays out, as it is unlikely that the corporations
and nations which have standing agreements with Colombia will permit the
Colombians to easily renege on any treaties.
"If Colombia is not careful in protecting
its traditional farming methods, it could become 100 percent dependent
on foreign grown foods, especially GMOs."
