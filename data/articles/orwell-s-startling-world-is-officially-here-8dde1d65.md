The following quotes from 1984â€³ should send shivers down anyones spine.
Orwells work is mentioned frequently in the context of todays society, and
rightfully so.
But do people realize just how incredibly exact these
predictions are that are happening before our eyes?
Unfortunately its all, as in all, coming to pass, and then some. These few
quotes from George Orwells predictive work will be an eye-opener to those
who only have a cursory knowledge of the book and simply remember
the Big
Brother image and the control issue and accompanying paranoia.
That it was predicted so perfectly is still up for grabs. Was he privy to
inside information? And if so, was he laying the groundwork for the future?
Or was he blowing the whistle on what hed found out while
inside the Fabian
Society with his predictive cohort Aldous Huxley?
Something is super fishy for sure, as always. Either way its happened.
Watch your mind fill in the blanks of just how todays surveillance state
has implemented these very control techniques that seemed like a far-fetched
nightmare scenario years ago. Written in 1948 (hence the reverse 1984) in
the sci-fi genre, it may just be the kind of wake up tool to use for those
youve been trying to get through to. So called science fiction transcends
the normal mind patterns and can elevate consciousness.
Any way you look at it, one cannot help but see this predictive programming
fits like a glove for todays dystopian world.
And thats no mere coincidence.
Citizen Spies, Thoughtcrime and Disappearing People
The
Department of Homeland Security, founded on the heels of
a staged 9/11,
opened the floodgates for surveillance and citizen spying.
Heres an allusion
to the eventual consequences of just such paranoid, oppressive state control
to start off the book.
Book One, Chapter 1
Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew
the reason.
It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths
and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry
about her. He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty
ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the party, the swallowers of
slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy.
The thought police would get him just the same. He had committed
- would have
committed, even if he had never set pen to paper - the essential crime that
contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime
was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge
successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were
bound to get you.
People simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed
from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped
out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten.
You were
abolished, annihilated: vaporized was the usual word.
Ministry of Truth, Thought Police, and Educational Indoctrination by the
State
Government
fully took over education decades ago, and for a reason.
Its a
slow process to change people, but that is the tactic of the would-be
controllers. This talks about the degradation of children, as were seeing
today through dumbing down education, mandatory drugs and vaccines,
adulterated food and an infected media.
Book One, Chapter 2
Parsons was Winstons fellow employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was a
fattish but active man of paralyzing stupidity, a mass of imbecile
enthusiasms - one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom,
more even than on the thought police, the stability of the Party depended.
Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that
by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned
into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency
whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party.
On the contrary, they
adored the Party and everything connected with it
All their ferocity was
turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners,
traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over
thirty to be frightened of their own children.
Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime is death.
Rewritten History and Total Media Control
The centralized ministry of truth has not been realized until recently
with only 6 mega corporations owning
the mainstream media today.
This, along
with an iron grip on so-called academia, after generations of cultural
amnesia, is a slam dunk.
Book One, Chapter 3
If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say this or that even,
it never happened - that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and
death.
And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed - if all records
told the same tale - then the lie passed into history and became truth.
Who
controls the past ran the Party slogan, controls the future: who controls
the present controls the past.
Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.
In
this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary
evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression
of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to
remain on record.
All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary.
Language Manipulation
- Facecrime
Extremely profound.
Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.
That the world is based
on hierarchy, dogma, self-identity paradigms and a false adherence to belief
systems speaks for itself.
To narrow the range of thought? Piece of cake.
Book One, Chapter 5
Dont you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of
thought?
Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at
the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand
such a conversation as we are having now?
The whole climate of thought will
be different.
In fact, there will be no thought, as we understand it now.
Orthodoxy means not thinking - not needing to think. Orthodoxy is
unconsciousness. - Syme
It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any
public place or within range of a telescreen.
The smallest thing could give
you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of
muttering to yourself - anything that carried with it the suggestion of
abnormality, of having something to hide.
In any case, to wear an improper
expression on your face
was itself a punishable offense.
There was even a
word for it in Newspeak: facecrime
Surveillance of your Nervous System
This is very real, and coming down the pipe fast.
Biometrics, pre-crime,
implants,
mind control devices, all in the mix. And its out in the open for
all to see.
Only theyve gotten the public to marvel at it as scientific
advancements instead of seeing them as the new caging and manipulative
devices that they truly are.
Book One, Chapter 6
Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your nervous system. At any moment the
tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible
symptom.
The People (Proles) are the Enemy
- Keep them Unconscious
Same old story.
Bread and circuses.
Numb down the masses, they might
realize were farming them.
Book One, Chapter 7
If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those
swarming disregarded masses, eighty-five percent of the population of
Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated.
Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they
have rebelled they cannot become conscious. - referring to the proles.
Even Loners are Dangerous - Ownlife Will not be Tolerated
This is more in place than hardly anyone would be willing to realize. The
actual poster excerpt above is real, and just a few items on their long
list.
Book One, Chapter 8
to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk
by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in
Newspeak: ownlife
True Science, False Choice and Unseen Controllers
How do most people conceptualize science? What they hear on the news, face
it.
Oh, science has found that
.
No one investigates the findings. They do
and think what theyre told.
Book Two, Chapter 9
In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased
to exist.
In Newspeak there is no word for Science. The empirical method
of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were
founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of
Ingsoc.
The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the
other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous
outrages upon morality and common sense. Actually, the three philosophies
are barely distinguishable
Oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts
nobody knows.
Sanity is not statistical.
Separated by War in the Name of Unity
This is interesting.
That yearning of humanity to feel connected is so
strong, yet the political divisions imposed on them by controlling tribal
leaders tells them otherwise. Fight, attack, destroy anything foreign to
ourselves and our way of life, and
maintain that state of continual war. All
false stimuli.
Why?
All these motives are anti-human and clearly for control.
Yet something still stirs within the human heart.
Book Two, Chapter 10
It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia
or Eastasia as well as here.
And the people under the sky were also very
much the same - everywhere, all over the world, hundreds or thousands of
millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one anothers
existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly
the same - people who had never learned to think but were storing up in their
hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the
world.
Lets Hope So
The dystopian nature of todays world becomes eerily apparent in those few
quotations.
The hope that humanity would some day throw off the chains of
such Machiavellian control has echoed down through history. Whether that too
is just a release valve given or allowed by these iron-fisted controllers is
something to consider.
Are we being so played that even our hopes and aspirations are being
channeled into impotence?
Religion is one such manifestation of that.
The hope of a future that
billions pray for but do little to realize besides be a better slave of the
state is a pretty clever ploy. Politics is another clear example, illusion
of freedom and choice to pacify the masses.
Who Will Open Their Eyes?
-
Are we willing to stand back and see the picture of the world for what it
really is?
-
Or would that require actions on our part were too entrained against and
thus intimidated from doing?
-
Has humanity been too placated to protect its
own family from suffocation?
-
Where is the courage?
-
Or is humanity just too afraid to stand up to its
executioners, even though they are an infinitesimal minority.
Time will tell.
But time in this physical reality waits for no man. Whats in motion will
not stop until something changes its course or stops it all together.
Will you put your shoulder to the wheel? Something to seriously consider.
I guarantee you... if youre willing to see the world for what it really is,
you will do something
and fast!
Otherwise you are not really seeing it.
