My next
set of articles are not for the faint of heart. If you desire to keep on
burying your head in the sand, then go watch the NFL Draft.
Of course,
if we do not collectively wake up the majority of sheep which inhabit this
country and motivate them to action against the globalists, the acronym
NFL will soon come to mean
Not For Long.
And Not For Long will soon represent how long the sheeple of this country
can keep their heads buried in the sand as the country disintegrates into
total chaos. No amount of cognitive dissonance, normalcy bias and general
apathy can protect even the most unaware of Americans as to what lies in
their immediate future.
The
solvency of the Federal Reserve is being
threatened and to understand the roots of the coming world war and
the roll
out of tyrannical martial law, over this issue, I need to take a brief look
at the historical underpinnings.
The Birth
of the Petrodollar
A novel system for monetary and exchange rates were
established in 1944.
The Bretton Woods Agreement was developed at the United
Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in
Bretton
Woods,
New Hampshire, from July 1-22, 1944. This
conference established the US dollar as the reserve currency of the world.
The
Banksters (e.g.
Rockefellers) reveled in their new found fortune. As a
result of the Bretton Woods Conference, all nations desiring to purchase
Middle East oil had to first purchase dollars and use these dollars to
complete the purchase of oil.
Nearly
everyone inside of our country benefited from this system. Americans
basically enjoyed a stable currency minus the inflation rates of about 5%
per year which served as an informal tax that went into the Federal Reserve
banksters pockets.
Thus, the Petrodollar was born. If the Petrodollar were
to ever be successfully undermined, our currency would sink faster than a
submarine with screen doors because there is nothing backing up our money.
The old
guard at the Federal Reserve worked from 1910 to 1971 to rid the economy of
the Gold Standard so that they could enforce debt slavery upon the American
people and government through encouraging a prolonged out of control
spending spree accompanied by the awarding of lucrative unbid contracts to
the elites corporations which would dramatically drive up the deficit and
line the pockets of the Federal Reserve owners.
The
coming
war with Syria is merely the opening act.
The main act, following
Syrian subjugation, will consist of the United States and Israel and perhaps
England attacking Iran.
Iran is the prize needed for the old guard of the
Federal Reserve to maintain its strangle hold on the global economy. On the
surface, attacking Iran seems like a good idea if it will preserve our
economy.
However, the risks associated with this course of action are
astronomical.
Why Every
American Should Fixate On This Issue
The
Petrodollar is in real trouble and so is your bank account, your job, your
ability to get gas, medicine, food and water. America is literally a push
button away from the total calamity that we see in the NBC show,
Revolution.
In many eyes, the Petrodollar must be maintained at all
costs.
On the
Precipice of WWIII
Syria is
the first real domino in the coming conflict that threatens all life on this
planet.
The take down of Egypt and Libya was mere foreplay. The real action
will commence in a few months with the invasion of Syria and the excuse will
be to 'save' humanity from Syrias 'weapons of mass destruction', namely,
chemical weapons.
Hmmm, isnt there a DHS chemical weapons attack drill
planned for either Denver or Portsmouth next month? But I digress, this
issue will be fully exposed in a subsequent complementary article in this
series.
Make no
mistake about it, America is headed towards war with Syria and dont think
for a second that this war will imitate, in any way, the wars in Iraq and in
Afghanistan. The previous wars compared to Syria, and later with Iran, is
childs play compared to anything we have been involved with in the history
of this nation.
The saving the Petrodollar strategy being pursued by
the
Federal Reserve is a high stakes gamble with you, your children and the
future of humanity being used as their collateral.
Proof
that the coming war is imminent is evidenced by the accusations being
currently made by the US government that Syria is using chemical weapons
against the rebels. In this fabrication of the Syrian version of the Boston
Marathon bombing false flag event, it is likely that if there are chemical
weapons in play, the CIA is the responsible party.
Why? Because all roads to
Tehran run through Damascus.
Iran is the actual target of the Federal
Reserves war intentions, because Iran is doing the unthinkable as it is
waging war on the old guard of
the New World Order, by selling its oil to
Russia, China and India for gold and this is a dire threat to the solvency
of the dollar.
First
Syria, Then Iran
Before
one can invade Iran, with the threat of Russian intervention looming, Syria
must first be occupied and fortified by US/NATO forces.
Occupying Syria
allows America and her allies to invade Iran from several directions.
Through Syria, we will see airstrikes which will fly unimpeded over Northern
Iraq. Also, and most importantly, the occupation of Syria will be a threat
to the mobilization of forces inside of Russia who would then come under the
American long and short range missile batteries, which will be installed in
Syria.
These missiles will surely be armed with battlefield nuclear
warheads. This deterrent could provide the Americans with enough time to
occupy most of Iran before Russia or China could act with its conventional
forces.
This strategy, however, dares the Chinese and Russians to not invoke
the use of large scale nuclear weapons in the biggest game of chicken ever
played on this planet.
The
Unexpected Twists and Turns of the Coming World War
I do not
expect China to attack the US in the Middle East, at least not at first.
I
expect the Chinese to move on Taiwan and let the North Koreans launch its
nuclear missiles against Japan. It is possible that Russia might further
invade the US through Alaska.
I never
thought that elements of the Red Dawn scenario would ever come to fruition,
but how many times have we seen the media tell us what is going to transpire
in advance of an event?
And while we are at it, I would anticipate that
China would approach the Southwestern underbelly of the United States via
Central America, given that the Chinese control the Panama Canal and are
rumored to have troops throughout Central America, including Mexico.
And if
things really go crazy, all sides may launch its ICBM missiles and their
submarine based nuclear missiles at each others homeland and then all bets
are off.
Perhaps, you now know why I constantly refer these criminal banksters who have hijacked our government as psychopathic.
Iran Is
'Public Enemy' Number One
Because
of Irans threat to the Petrodollar, Iran occupies a similar, but much more
dangerous position than did Iraq in 2001.
As we now all know,
9/11
provided the motivation to invade Iraq. No, Iraq was not responsible for the
9/11 attacks and
Bush did admit as much.
But that did not prevent Bush
from capitalizing on the emotion from 9/11 so that America would confuse
the issues and tacitly accept the invasion of Iraq in which the Iraqis were
lumped together with all Middle Eastern nations who want to kill us because
of our freedoms.
Specifically,
why did Iraq have to be invaded?
Simple, Saddam Hussein was
attempting to sell his oil in currency other than Federal Reserve Notes
(i.e. the Euro).
He was threatening the Federal Reserve and at that time, he
was also a threat to the central bankers in their headquarters, otherwise
known as the Bank of International Settlements, which controls all central
banking.
During that time frame,
these banksters would have done anything
at that time to prevent a threat to the worlds reserve currency, namely the
dollar, which they controlled.
Following
the completion of the second Iraq war, Exxon and BP controlled 80% of Iraqi
oil fields and nobody would be selling Iraqi oil in either the Euro or for
gold. However, the game has changed, Iran has replaced Iraq as the major
threat to the stability of the Federal Reserve Notes.
Iran is economically
destroying the US. Unfortunately for every man, woman and child in America,
that day of economic reckoning is quickly approaching.
China
has
commenced buying Iranian oil in gold. India has followed suit, as have
the Russians. The days of the Petrodollar are numbered and therefore, so is
the only source of backing of the dollar.
Have you and your family prepared
for the collapse of the dollar and ultimately the collapse of society?
It is
coming and it coming fast.
The Russians and the Chinese
Have Warned the US
President Hu
Creating the pretext for
fighting a war, and then successfully selling the American public on the
need to fight the war, is one thing. However, winning the war, is quite
another.
How serious are the Chinese and Russians at standing up to the
imperialistic United States?
Considering that both Chinese
President Hu and Major
General Zhang Zhaozhong
have threatened the United States with nuclear war if they invade Iran, the
prudent opinion says that this is the newest version of the Axis of Evils
line in the sand, has been clearly drawn.
The Dawn of the American
Empire
America is in a very
difficult dilemma.
If we acquiesce to the Russian and Chinese threat of war
for invading Iran, our dollar will collapse. If we attack Iran after taking
over Syria, the nuclear powers with formidable armies have promised
retaliation. America could see its first invasion on American soil since the
War of 1812.
It is possible that the
Americans will only invade Syria in a game of brinksmanship with the
Russians and the Chinese, in order to test their resolve (e.g. a game of
military chicken).
However, I dont think that is likely. The Federal
Reserve will not back down.
They have already
killed Gaddafi and Hussein in
order to preserve the Petrodollar. They are not going to back down to the
Iranians, Chinese and Russians because it will not be their children doing
the fighting and dying, it will be our children.
Now, does it make sense on
why
the elite are driving down the
price of Gold so they can buy up as much
as they can for as cheaply as they can? They intend to be the last men
standing at the end of the next great war to end all wars.
And just how will the elite
sell us on war? You can bet there will be more false flag events, with each
one being more horrific than the previous one.
And guess who will get the
blame? It does not take a rocket scientist to accurately speculate that the
last of the
false flag events will be nuclear and then all hell will break
loose.
Conclusion
It is clear, it is hands off
Iran or it means WWIII.
Does anyone really think that the Federal Reserve
is going to take this lying down? Could the path to WWIII be the reason that
so many bankers have left the United States because they know what is
coming?
How do the false flag events
tie into this?
One hint I will offer is that once you understand the
globalist objectives,
the Boston Marathon bombing and the aftermath
of
martial law will make a lot of sense.
What will the accompanying martial
law look like in this country? The last question is the easiest to answer,
because the government has left a trail of documents which details how
martial law will enforced and it is frightening.
