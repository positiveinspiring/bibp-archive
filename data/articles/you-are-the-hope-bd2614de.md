If there is hope, dear readers, you are it.
You are motivated to find truth.
You can think outside the box. You can see through propaganda.
You are the remnant with the common sense that once was a common American
virtue. You come to this site, because you get explanations that are not
agenda-driven, that are not BS, that are not right-wing or left-wing,
conservative or liberal, Republican or Democrat. You get explanations based
on my lifetime of unique education and experience.
Some of you are young enough to be equipped with
the energy and courage to organize whatever resistance there may be to
the
Gestapo State that is descending on the United States of America.
Until the
George W. Bush Regime,
I never thought that it could happen here.
I could not imagine law professors and
Department of 'Justice' (sic) officials writing legal memos justifying, in
the name of
a hyped "war on terror,"
the termination of civil rights for United States Citizens. We were the land
of the free. The Constitution was our bedrock.
Yet, the Constitution and Bill of Rights were
easily taken away from the inattentive American people.
The Constitution did not protect native inhabitants and slaves who were not
considered part of the American population, but the universal suppression in
the U.S. of non-whites rights produced in the end the civil rights movement
that brought moral awareness of the wrongs and successfully hitched its
cause to the founding documents of the country.
-
Where today is moral awareness as
Washington bombs civilian populations around the globe?
-
Where is the moral conscience of the the
civil rights movement as the First Black President, the first member
of the oppressed class to sit in the Oval Office, validates the Bush
Regimes assertion of the right of the unaccountable executive to
ignore habeas corpus and due process?
Not satisfied with this crime, Obama
asserted the right of the executive branch to murder any citizen suspected,
without proof being offered to a court, of undefined "support of terrorism."
Today all Americans have fewer rights than
blacks had prior to the Civil Rights Act.
Anything, including a column critical of war and the police state, can be
declared to be "in support of terrorism."
As the tyrant Bush put it:
"You are with us, or you are against us."
The print and TV media and many Internet sites
got the message: Serve Washingtons agenda, and will you will prosper.
Advertisers and the CIA will pump money into
your coffers. Challenge us and you will be demonized and could face a
military tribunal, indefinite detention, or assassination.
Bradley Manning and
Julian Assange are being persecuted for telling the truth.
So far, Washington has convinced the public that Washingtons terror is
mainly limited to Muslims, who are obligingly demonized by print, TV, and
much of the Internet media. However, if Muslim American citizens lack civil
liberty, so do all other American citizens. Those who are safe are those who
ally with the tyrant and remain subservient.
To ally with the tyrant, a United States citizen must have no moral
conscience, no sense of justice, no compassion for the innocent and
dispossessed. These are the worst kind of Americans; yet, they are the only
ones who can succeed in the present environment.
Every time I write a column that is the truth or the truth as I am able to
discover it, instead of hawking the propaganda line, I move up on the list
of those who are persona non grata in the Empire.
A writer can find himself demonized and declared a kook simply by reporting
findings from distinguished scientists, high-rise architects, structural
engineers, first responders, and an international collection of high
government officials.
Not too long ago a writer or reporter for the
Huffington Post discovered to his surprise that Pat Buchanan and I disagreed
with
all the wars that had been launched to
'protect us from terrorism.'
He asked me for an interview, and I agreed.
An hour or so after the interview was posted on the Huffington Post, I
received an emergency call or email.
He had been criticized for interviewing me,
"for giving you a forum when you are a 9/11
skeptic."
He was unsure that it was possible for a Reagan
presidential appointee to be
a
'9/11 skeptic' and asked if I was.
I replied that I had reported the findings of scientists, architects,
engineers, and the public testimony of first responders, because I thought
these were qualified people whose opinions at least ranked equally with the
politicians on the 9/11 Commission and the talking heads on Fox "News" and
CNN, none of whom could pass a high school test in the laws of physics, much
less high-rise architecture and structural engineering.
The Huffington Post writer panicked. Instead of taking down the interview,
he felt impelled to assure readers and his boss that he had been deceived.
He wrote at the beginning and ending of the
interview that he did not know he was interviewing someone
about the Iraq War who had given ink to
those conspiracy theorists who raised questions about the truthfulness of
the U.S. government. He wrote that my views on the wars should be
disregarded, because I wrote that scientists, architects, engineers, and
first responders provided evidence contrary to the governments claims.
And there you have it.
The Huffington Post has far more readers than I do, and far more money.
There is no limit on the ability of the Huffington Post to tell and sell the
lies of the Agenda.
I can remember when I was a Wall Street Journal editor and columnist, a
Business Week columnist, a Scripps Howard News Service columnist and
appeared regularly in the major mainstream print media and even from time to
time on TV talking head programs.
Today, the editor or producer who gave me a
forum would be fired instantly, and they all know it.
It is discouraging that after so many transparent lies and orchestrations -
weapons of mass destruction, al-Qaeda connections, Iranian nukes - the
majority of Americans still believe the 'government.' Americans are even
buying into the line that Syria is ruled by a brutal dictator whose
overthrow justifies Washingtons alliance with its 9/11 enemy, al-Qaeda, in
order to overthrow a secular ruler who constrains al-Qaeda.
Washington has come full circle. Its enemy is now its ally. Washington
wasted trillions of dollars and countless lives in eleven years of war and
constructed a domestic police state all in order to combat
al Qaeda with whom Washington is now allied against the Syrian
government.
The publics response to
the Boston Marathon Bombing is even more
discouraging.
Not even King George and his Redcoats could
achieve what Homeland Security just pulled offlocking down 100 square miles
of Boston and its suburbs with heavily armed troops tramping through
citizens homes barking harsh orders, all justified by a hunt for one
19-year old suspect.
It was the Third Reichs Gestapo in operation
right here in "freedom and democracy" America. Ron Paul is correct
that the suspension of civil liberty is a greater threat than the bombing.
Note the governments euphemism for martial law - "shelter-in-place."
Two brothers have been convicted in the media and by
the
Obama Regime, including the presidents own words, of a
bombing without the public ever being presented with any evidence except
anonymous unattributed reports and a film of the alleged brothers walking
with backpacks, which were ubiquitous.
I am old enough to remember when it was impermissible for government and
media to convict a person prior to the jurys verdict.
Americans once lived in a free country governed
by the rule of law in which a person was innocent until proven guilty.
-
What was the reason or evidence for
naming the brothers suspects?
-
Was any reason given, or was the film of
the two walking with backpacks simply shown over and over, hour
after hour, day after day, with the media reporting that these are
the suspects?
-
In other words, was it beat into your
brain that they were suspects because there they are in the film?
-
If not, why was the same film shown
repeatedly?
Fox "News" was still showing the film on April
26, eleven days after the bombing and might still be showing it.
Did you experience:
"Here are the suspects. See them. They have
backpacks. See. We know that they are suspects, because, see, there they
are."
When is the last time the media investigated
anything?
A good candidate for investigation is the
post-bombing rampage the brothers allegedly went on, robbing a 7/11 store
(later contradicted by local police), killing a campus policeman, shooting a
transit cop, high-jacking a SUV and releasing the owner.
-
Why would terrorists seeking to escape
in order to strike again call attention to themselves in such
outlandish ways and release a car-jacked owner to alert the police
of the tag number?
-
If the brothers were willing to kill
police with gunfire and innocents with bombs, why release the guy
whose vehicle they stole so he could inform the police of the
license plate and make the brothers capture easier?
-
What is the evidence, other than
"reports from authorities," that these events occurred or had any
more connection to the brothers than the falsely reported 7/11
robbery that local police disavowed?
-
Why does the U.S. media simply accept
whatever government authorities say?
-
Where is the evidence of a first
shoot-out and a second shoot-out?
The second shoot-out consisted of the
authorities bombarding a motionless youth bleeding from wounds in a boat
with multiple volleys of stun grenades and then multiple gunshots.
The unconscious 19 year old was unarmed and
unable to respond to the boat owner who discovered him. As he lies there, he
is shot many times, including through the throat, and is on life support.
But the very next day, according to
the presstitute media, he is providing
hand-written confessions.
Was the purpose of the reports of a murderous rampage to create fear among
the population so that they would accept martial law and home invasions by
armed troops ordering American citizens out of their homes with hands over
their heads on the pretext that they might be harboring the Boston Marathon
Bomber?
The videos of the street celebration in which Bostonians thank the police
and of the two Boston families, if not scripted by actors, shows Americans
who far from opposing the police state welcome it.
A father says that he with his daughter in his
arms was forced out of his home by troops pointing automatic rifles at their
heads, but that he was thankful for the safety the police provided him by
violating every civil right that the Constitution gave him.
A woman says it was scary but that, "the police
are just doing their jobs."
-
Are Americans now so brainwashed that
they attribute their safety to the presence of a Gestapo Police
State?
-
Why have detention facilities been
built?
-
Why did Homeland Security purchase a
billion or more rounds of ammunition?
-
Why does Homeland Security have 2,700
tanks and a paramilitary force?
-
Why arent these questions being
investigated?
The U.S. Constitution is the product of 900
years of human efforts to restrain brutal government and to make government
subject to law.
It only took Bush and Obama eleven
years to get rid of it.
