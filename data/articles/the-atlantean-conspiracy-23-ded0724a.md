Oklahoma City Bombing
The April 19th, 1995, Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal building
resulted in 168 deaths and over 800 injuries.
Though overwhelming evidence
disputes their claims, the government and mainstream media quickly agreed
that the bombing was perpetrated by a terrorist named, Timothy McVeigh.
Allegedly McVeigh acted alone and parked a single Ryder truck bomb affront
the Murrah building on that morning, however, 20 eyewitnesses reported
seeing 2 men.
20 eyewitnesses saw two men in the Ryder truck, each one described the
second man as middle eastern and said it absolutely was not Terry Nichols
(the patsy John Doe 2 agents tried to blame).
All 20 people filled out 302s,
investigative reports, but none have ever surfaced. Also just like 9/11, the
Pentagons 80 CCTVs, and the London Bombings in the tube, the 12 camera
tapes at the Murrah building were seized and withheld, all for reasons of
national security.
David Icke, Alice in Wonderland and The World
Trade Center Disaster (156)
The 20 witnesses reports were ignored and the security camera tapes were
withheld.
When forced by investigators to find a second patsy, officials
came up with Terry Nichols, who they claimed to be McVeighs accomplice,
even though all eyewitnesses agreed the second man in the truck was middle
eastern, and definitely not Terry Nichols.
McVeigh was arrested so conveniently for a traffic offence immediately
after the bombing for the same reason that Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in
a cinema immediately after the Kennedy assassination and Osama bin Laden was
named as the culprit after 9/11.
They are the patsies required by
problem-reaction-solution to hide the real orchestrators. Just as 9/11 was a
massive version of what happened in Oklahoma, so Oklahoma was a repeat of
the Kennedy assassination.
Lee Harvey Oswald was a US agent who was placed
in the right place at the right time without being told exactly why he was
there. He realized this after Kennedy was shot and ran. When he was arrested
he said he was a patsy, a stooge, and would have said so in court.
Thats
why he was paraded in public to allow another government agent, Jack Ruby,
to shoot him and kill the evidence. In the same way, very possibly, McVeigh
was a government stooge who parked the Ryder truck without knowing the full
story.
David Icke, Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center (155)
On the morning of April 19th, shortly after the bombing, in live broadcasts,
CBS, CNN, and NBC all reported on three additional bombs inside the
building!
One of the bombs exploded and two others were found and defused.
Oklahoma Citys NBC affiliate, KFOR, in their live feed immediately
reported:
The first bomb that was in the Federal Building did go off. It
did the damage that you see right there.
The second explosive was found and
defused. The third explosive that was found and they are working on right
now as we speak, I understand both the second and third explosives if you
can imagine this were larger than the first.
So try to imagine two or
threefold happening what weve already seen there. It is just incredible to
think that there was that much heavy artillery that was somehow moved into
the downtown Oklahoma City Federal Building.
Once Timothy McVeigh was arrested, all reports of the additional bombs
inside the building ceased.
The mainstream media quickly parroted the
government line, and America was assured that the perpetrator(s)
McVeigh/Nichols acted alone using a single truck bomb.
This, however, has
been disproved repeatedly.
Out of hundreds of people we interviewed, we couldnt find a single person
who said theyd only heard one explosion
The University of Oklahomas own
seismographic reports, as well as the
U.S. Geological Survey reports two different scientific institutions show
multiple explosions.
But for there to have been multiple explosions, Timothy
McVeigh would have had to have accomplices... and that didnt fit in with
the federal story, especially if the reality showed that it had to be a
group that had access to a federal building for long, extended periods of
time, like the BATF and the FBI.

Even the US Air Forces own 1997 blast effects study of the Oklahoma City
bombing verified the impossibility of being the result of a single bomb.
General Benton K. Partin concluded that,
It is impossible to ascribe the
damage that occurred on April 19th, 1995 to a single truck bomb containing
4,800 pounds
In fact, the maximum predicted damage of the floor panels of
the Murrah federal building is equal to approximately 1% of the total floor
area of the building
It must be concluded that the damage at the Murrah
federal building is not the result of the truck bomb itself, but rather due
to other factors such as locally placed charges within the building itself.
In the report General Partin also mentions how a single bomb cannot explain
the failure of many columns in the back of the building as compared to the
non-failure of columns in the front where the truck was parked.
Partin
concluded that shaped demolitions charges were indeed used inside the
building. The blast effects study showed that the maximum damage possible
from a single truck bomb would affect only 1% of the floor area.
Take a look
at any photo of the Murrah building after the explosions.
To ascribe the
amount of actual damage done to merely this is ludicrous.
Glenn and Kathy Wilburn, who lost two small children in the bombing, worked
constantly and passionately for years to uncover the truth of what happened.
They conducted and documented more than 300 hours of interviews, and
persuaded people to talk who had remained silent for fear of the
consequences.
They established beyond question that a heavily armed bomb
squad had been in downtown Oklahoma
near the Murrah Building that morning before the bombs exploded
Some
parents saw these people in their bomb squad uniforms as they dropped their
children off at the day care centre at the Murrah Building, children they
would never see alive again.
Eventually, after months of denial by the FBI
and other government agencies, the Sheriffs Department had to admit that
the bomb squad had been there.
David Icke, Alice in Wonderland and the
World Trade Center (1534)
After months of meticulous independent investigation, Glenn and Kathy
Wilburn got the Sheriffs Department to actually admit what they already
knew from multiple, consistent eyewitness testimonies: a government
bomb squad
had been at the Murrah federal building that very morning! Emergency radio
transmission transcripts from that morning also prove that many policemen
and firefighters witnessed BATF at the scene.
Oklahoma lawyer Daniel J. Adomitis was interviewed saying,
There was this fairly large truck with a
trailer behind it. It had a shield on the side of the door that said bomb
disposal or bomb squad below it. And I really found that interesting. You
know, Id never seen anything like that in person.
Do you realize what you have just read? The government had multiple
surveillance cameras
the cameras also show the BATF agents hiding out
right down the street, preparing to pounce on the operation and declare
themselves the heroes, the saviors
From A to Z, there are federal
fingerprints all over the Oklahoma City Bombing, and the government is doing
everything it can to suppress the truth.
Bill Clinton is the servant of the
New World Order, whose approval rating exploded after the attack.
His attack
dog, the Butcher of Waco, Janet Reno was very happy to blame everything on
Christians, conservatives, and gun owners. It was her excuse to expand
federal control over local police and to merge the military with the police
in new giant antiterrorism training programs.
Alex Jones, 911 Descent into
Tyranny
Another strange coincidence to note is that just two years
earlier in 1993, Martin Keating, the brother of Oklahomas Governor, Frank
Keating, wrote a novel called The Final Jihad.
In his book, a man named
Tom McVeigh bombs an Oklahoma City federal building!
Linda Cavanaugh, from
NBCs Oklahoma affiliate KFOR, even reported on this oddity:
The News
Channel has learned of another strange development. Apparently, before the
bombing, Governor Frank Keatings brother, Martin, had been working on a
novel about a terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City. Stranger still, one of the
characters in the novel was named Thomas McVeigh.
Also adding to the
mystery, Martin Keating dedicated his book to the Knights of the Secret
Circle.
Could he be referring to the Knights of the Milner-Rhodes
Round
Table secret societies?
The US government hired the same company to carry away the remains of the
Oklahoma City bombing and the World Trade Center the company is ironically
named Controlled Demolitions.
David Icke, Alice in Wonderland and the
World Trade Center (152)
The handling of the World Trade Center rubble almost mirrors that of the
Oklahoma City Alfred P. Murrah building.
After eyewitnesses reported several
explosions and original newscasts detailed the recovery of second and third
explosive devices, the government declared that there was just one bomb and
the remains of the
building were professionally demolished by Controlled Demolitions Inc., the
same company that was first on the scene to cart away the WTC rubble.
Debris
of the federal building was then carted off to a private landfill and
guarded 24 hours a day by Wackenhut private security. Nothing to hide there
then, eh?
The FEMA team that investigated why the towers collapsed was
headed by Dr. W. Gene Corley, the same individual the government called upon
to whitewash the Waco fire enquiry and the Oklahoma City bombing.
