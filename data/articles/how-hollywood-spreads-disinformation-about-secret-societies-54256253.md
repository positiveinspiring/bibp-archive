During the last years, a new trend appeared in
Hollywood: secret societies being at the center of movie intrigues.
Some might find this surprising since secret
societies are supposed to be
well
secret. Many people in the movie
industry are part of those Brotherhoods so what is the reasoning behind
this?
Well look at the myth Hollywood is trying to
create by examining National Treasure and Angels and Demons.
A decade ago, movies about Freemasonry or
the Illuminati were rare and far apart (see
here a nice list of Masonic references in
movies).
There has however been a major switch during the
last decade. The world wide public has witnessed major blockbuster movies
featuring those Brotherhoods at the center of the story.
Their exoteric symbols are abundantly displayed
and some of their history is even explained.
-
Why are those societies exposing
themselves to the average movie goers, who, for the most part arent
even aware of their existence?
-
Isnt secrecy an important requisite for
the survival of those orders?
I believe an important change is taking place
in the communication strategies of these elite societies.
The advent of the digital age, where any
individual can create and publish content has rendered the secrecy of such
organizations impossible. Self-published websites, books, documentaries,
DVDs and other medias have exposed many secrets of Masonry and other orders.
Information which could only be found in rare and exclusive books is now a
Google search away.
I have encountered some Masons who were
astonished by the level of knowledge possessed by the profane. Those types
of Masonic scholars, who arent actually initiated into the Brotherhood,
were very rare not too long ago.
Since the digital switch is irreversible (and completed), occult orders have
adapted their strategy to this new context (theyve probably saw this coming
years ago).
The strategy is :
If they have to know about us, well tell
them what to know.
Through Hollywood and best-selling books, secret
societies are being introduced to the average Joe but with one BIG
condition: the public is given a distorted, caricatured and romantic
portrayal of secret societies.
We are introducing in pop culture a mythical
lore around secret societies, associating them with fascinating symbols,
treasures hunts and exotic adventures. The viewers believe they are actually
learning facts about Freemasonry or the Illuminati and they
leave the movies with a sense of wonder, fascination and admiration. Those
feelings are however based on totally erroneous facts, dubious explanations
and fairy tale story telling.
After viewing those movies, the viewer has a
positive predisposition concerning those orders and will be less inclined to
believe and research conspiracies related to them.
National Treasure
This blockbuster adventure movie was produced by
Walt Disney Pictures, a brand that
guarantees family-friendly entertainment.
So parents can bring their kids and enjoy a
nice, wholesome, Masonic disinformation session. The movie revolves around a
treasure hunt based on clues left by prominent Masons on the Declaration of
Independence.
The movie starts with the main character (played by Nicholas Cage) as a
little boy, searching for information about his family history. The boys
grandfather comes in and gives the boy (and the audience) a totally false
and distorted story of the
Knights Templars and the Freemasons.
Here are some of the claims:
-
The Knights Templars found under the
Temple of Solomon a great treasure which was lost for a thousand
years. Theyve brought the treasure back to Europe.
It has been said that the Templars possessed extremely rare
religious artifacts. Were they found under the Temple of Solomon?
The legend says yes. The movie however describes the treasure as
gold coins, statues and such.
-
The Templars decided to smuggle the
treasure into the United States and changed their name to the
Freemasons.
This is where everything falls apart. The Templars did not
change their name to the Freemasons at the dawn of the American
civilization.
The Templars have actually
disappeared in 1312, which is more than 400 years before the
creation of the USA.
-
Seemingly untouchable for nearly
two centuries, the Templars fell from grace spectacularly after
the loss of the Holy Land: in 1307, all Templars in France were
arrested on charges of heresy, homosexuality, denial of the
cross and devil worship. The order was suppressed by the Pope in
1312, and Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master, was burnt at
the stake as a heretic two years later
- Sean Martin, The Knights
Templar
The Freemasons are not an all-American
institution, as the movie insinuates.
It is a European secret society dating from the
Middle-Ages, who opened lodges in North America to expand its reach. The
goal of Masonry is not to protect a great Templar treasure, it is an
ancient order of builders who incorporated into its rites, over the years,
teachings of the Templars, Rosicrucians and the Illuminati.
The Templars was an occult order who had fought during the Crusades at the
side of the Church. It is during their stay in the Middle East that
theyve secured occult knowledge from eastern mystics and brought it back to
Europe. Theyve became great bankers and Cathedral builders (in which
theyve included occult symbolism). They were known to practice the
Kaballah, many forms of magic and the black arts.
Their conflicting interests with
the
Catholic church ultimately lead to their persecution and demise.
The Freemasons can be considered spiritual descendants of the Knights
Templar due to their study of esoteric sciences, their building of monuments
and their philosophy based on Gnostic principles. The link between the
Templars and the Masons is being cultivated due to the mythical lore
surrounding the Knights.
In other words, its good publicity.
In order to insure great popularity for
the [Scottish] rite, he [Isaac Long] linked it directly with the
Templars by a mysterious legend.
-Domenico Margiotta 33°, Adriano
Lemmi
So the educational part of the movie gives in
fact a mythical and romantic story of Freemasonry.
Some viewers might view this distortion as fact,
others will associate everything Masonic to a fairytale. The important thing
is that the truth about Freemasonry is concealed behind a veil of mythology.
Interesting choice of transition between the
face of the grandfather telling the story and the Pyramid of Gizeh.
His eye becomes the All-Seeing Eye of the
Great Architect.
Esoteric Meaning of the Movie
Masonic Washington Monument
As Above, So Below
(warning: major spoilers ahead)
Like all true mythological stories, National
Treasure has an exoteric meaning for the ignorant masses and an esoteric
meaning for the initiates. If the exoteric story is meant to mislead the
public, the esoteric meaning carries however great truths about occult
brotherhoods. Heres the hidden meaning.
The ancient treasure that was jealously guarded by ancient civilizations
is in fact occult knowledge, the Mysteries, that could break the shackles of
materialism and help their possessor access divinity (Kaballah, alchemy,
gnosticism and occult sciences).
This treasure disappeared for a thousand years
from the Western world, which corresponds to the early Christian period. The
movie says that it was eventually discovered by the Knights Templar in
Jerusalem, under the Temple Solomon (the Freemasons sacred building) and
brought it back to Europe. This knowledge then migrated to the USA through
secret societies.
The hero of the movie is on a quest for illumination and the riddles he must
solve represent the initiations one must pass before accessing higher
knowledge. This all-important treasure is symbolically buried under Trinity
Church in New York, in a hidden cave which is dark and cavernous. Ben Gates
has to light up the torch of illumination to find his way to the hidden
knowledge.
The torch represents the Luciferian doctrine
of American Freemasonry instituted by Albert Pike.
In the highest degrees, Lucifer is taught to be
the light bearer, the god of Good who shows to path to
illumination.
Nicholas Cage with the
torch of Lucifer
Its [high degrees of Scottish Rite]
religion is Manichean neo-gnosticism, teaching that the divinity is dual
and that Lucifer is the equal of Adonay, with Lucifer,
the God of Light and Goodness (Enki?)
struggling for humanity against Adonay the God of Darkness and
Evil (Enlil?).
-Domenico Margiotta 33°, Adriano
Lemmi
When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the
proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the
mystery of his craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands
and before he may step onwards and upwards he must prove his ability to
properly apply (this) energy.
- Manly P. Hall, Lost Keys of
Freemasonry
Back to the story.
Ben Gates, with his Luciferian torch finds the
path to illumination and obtains access to an infinite source of knowledge.
During the scene where the heroes look around the treasure room, they find
very significant items: Scrolls from the Library of Alexandria, Egyptian
statues and other artifacts from the Antiquity. All of those objects refer
to the occult knowledge that has been communicated through the ages through
secret societies.
At the end of the movie, Ben Gates speaks with the FBI inspector and begs
him not to send him to jail.
Flashing his Masonic ring, the representative of
the law says someone has to go to jail for the stealing of the Declaration
of Independence. The next scene shows the bad guys (the non-Masons)
getting arrested, even if they did not actually steal the Declaration.
We see here a blatant example of the Masonic
oath superseding the law.
The FBI agent willfully ignored the law to help
his Masonic brother.

Then end of the movie shows the heroes rich and
happy. Theres no esoteric meaning to this, it is just a sappy Disney
ending.
Angels and Demons
This movie is based on Dan Browns novel which
focuses on
the Illuminati and its war against the
Catholic Church.
The hero runs across Rome to save
the
Vatican from a mega-bomb which was set up by Illuminati agents to
blow at midnight. The first page of Dan Browns book claims that the
Illuminati was factual, inciting the readers to take everything written in
the book as facts. They should not do so.
In the beginning of the movie, Robert Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) ventures
himself into explaining the Illuminati.
Here are some of his claims:
The Illuminati was founded by Galileo
Galilei in response to the Churchs refusal of his heliocentric theory
The Illuminati was officially founded in Upper Bavaria, by
Adam Weishaupt on May 1st 1776. This is
more than 130 years after Galileis death and not even in the same
country. The movies association of Galilei with the Illuminati seems
like an attempt to associate this brilliant scientists name to the
conspiratorial secret society.
Of all the means I know
to lead men, the most effectual is a concealed mystery.
Adam Weishaupt
The Illuminati did not become violent
before the 17th century.
It never was violent, its actions were based on infiltration and
subversion.
It was an association of scientists, physicists and astronomers
concerned with the Churchs inaccurate teachings and they were
dedicated to scientific truth. The Vatican didnt like that, so the
Church started to hunt them down and kill them.
The Illuminati was not a group of scientists
dedicated to the advancement of common knowledge. The movie falsely
portrays the secret society as the necessary rational counterpart to
Christianitys requirement of blind faith and its hindering of
scientific advancement.
In this optic, the average viewer cannot
disagree with Tom Hanks description of the Illuminati and sees the
order in a favorable way. The real aim of the Illuminati was the
overthrow of traditional institutions in favor of a new world order.
The objects of this powerful organization of
the Bavarian Illuminati, were:
-
The destruction of Christianity and of
all Monarchical Governments
-
The destruction of nations as such in
favor of universal internationalism
-
The discouragement of patriotic and
loyal effort branded as narrow minded prejudice, incompatible with
the tenets of goodwill to all men and the cry of Universal
Brotherhood
-
The abolition of family ties and of
marriage by means of systematic corruption
-
The suppression of the rights of
inheritance and property.
-Lady Queenborough, Occult Theocracy
The Bavarian Illuminati has dissolved some years
after its creation.
Researchers however say that the Illuminati has
successfully integrated itself within modern Freemasonry. Illuminati
thinkers believed that worldwide reach of Masonic lodges represented the
ideal platform for the propagation of their ideals.
To sum up, the Illuminati was not an association of bright scientists
dedicated to the advancement of scientific truths. It was secret society
who, through infiltration and subversion, aimed to overthrow traditional
institutions in order serve the best interests a secret elite. It is true
that the Illuminati was thoroughly anti-Church but this war wasnt the main
reason of its existence.
Nowadays, the Illuminati is considered to be a
hidden order which recruits within Freemasonry potent candidates for the
continuation of its agenda.
Esoteric Meaning of the Movie
(warning: major spoilers ahead)
Dan Browns work has mostly been focused on
secret societies. There is an important reason why he has the full support
of Hollywood: his works serve the agenda of disinformation.
In the movie, the Illuminati threatens the Vatican to destroy the Church by
light. Light refers to the explosion of the anti-matter bomb but
it also refers to information propaganda and indoctrination.
The only true way to make the masses turn their
back on Christianity is not by destroying the Vatican, but by changing the
way people see their religious elite. In that optic, the movie itself is the
bomb against the Vatican. Even if the Church, with the help of Robert
Langdon, apparently prevails at the end of the movie, the viewer of
Angels and Demons has spent two hours seeing all the symbols, rituals
and figures of Catholicism being desecrated.
Some examples: Robert Langdon destroys the
archives of the Vatican, candidates for papacy are kept in cages like
animals, one candidate is crucified and burned inside a church, the tomb of
the defunct Pope is opened to reveal his grossly deformed face, etc.
Candidate to Papacy
crucified and burnt inside a church
All those scenes have a strong symbolic meaning
which deeply affect the conscientiousness of the viewers.
The holy and divine aura surrounding the
Vatican is replaced by gruesome deaths, destruction and corruption. The
whole movie depicts the institution as an inadequate, stubborn and
reactionary relic of the past.
To top it off, the viewers learn that the whole
Illuminati thing was a big setup, masterminded by the son of the Pope (yes
apparently, the Pope had a son) to take his position. So the movie
tells the viewer that the Illuminati doesnt even exist and that the
Church is so corrupted that its members are ready to commit the most
horrendous sins to obtain power.
The viewers ultimately leave the movie with the exact ideas the elite wants
them to keep:
-
the Illuminati is a fairy tale and, when
it actually existed, it was an association of great thinkers
dedicated to the advancement of science
-
the Catholic Church is not holy, it is a
deeply flawed and human institution, which is bound to disappear due
to its aversion to science.
Through this movie, the real Illuminati denies
its own existence while still carrying out its plan to destroy organized
religions by constant indoctrination.
The age old struggle for power between
the
Catholic Church and occult orders is taking place on our movie
screens and we can clearly see who is winning.
To Conclude
The trend of seeing secret societies in books and movies is not about
to end. Dan Browns next novel, The Lost Symbol will also focus around
Freemasonry and its ties with Washington.
These works are now appearing as a result of the
democratization of information, which allows regular people to access
information which was previously inaccessible. These movies serve the same
purpose as occult symbols: to reveal and to conceal.
They reveal to the initiates while they mislead
the profane.
Hollywood movies have been used to promote
numerous agendas such as the Vietnam war, the fear of Communism, the fear of
Islamic terrorism, the promotion of American values, etc.
The movies analyzed above simply promote a new
agenda, which is disinformation about secret societies.
