You are the Founding Fathers
of the Future Generations
This Awareness indicates that the
threat is one thing, and needs to be observed and needs to be given attention,
but a threat, while it may continue to exist, does not necessarily result
in oppression. The resulting oppression is that which comes when entities
do not heed or watch and become aware of the threats. Therefore this awareness
suggests that you continue to be awakened and alarmed, but you appreciate
the moments wherein you are free, and use those moments to help preserve future
freedom, to help defuse that threat that might otherwise impinge on your future.
That you think
not only of your freedom, but also of the freedom of your children and the
future generations
This Awareness indicates that you
think not only of your freedom, but also of the freedom of your children and
the future generations, for you are the founding fathers of the future generations.
You are the heroes of tomorrow's generations, and if you fail these future
generations, these children of your children may curse you, and rightly so.
This Awareness indicates that it is very important for entities to be aware
of the dangers and threats to the freedom and security of their own and future
generations, and to do what is within their own power to make sure that these
freedoms are passed from generation to generation; that every moment there
are entities who would deny these freedoms, who would seek to gain their own
power and freedom at the expense of others.
This Awareness suggests that in truth,
no one is free until all are free, but these entities do not understand, and
they seek to gain more freedom for themselves by denying freedom to others.
Therefore, this Awareness suggests that you make sure that their excessive
greed for power or personal freedom at the expense of others is not expressed
in such a way as to deny your freedom and the freedom of your children and
their children. This Awareness indicates that it is important for you to understand,
when someone presents something that they say is good for you and your children,
it is important to look at it and to question whether this is just another
trick to deny your freedoms, or whether indeed it has something to offer your
children and your children's children.
Does the
Proposed Health care System Pose a threat?
This Awareness indicates the question:
If the health care programs requires that all citizens in the country have
a health card, does this not constitute a national identity card? And is this
not the way of tracking individuals, much the license plates on cars, and
is this really the main purpose of this so-called health care plan that is
being promoted with such fanfare?, or is it truly a humanitarian effort to
make sure that everyone has proper health care?
This Awareness asks also: Why does
this health care plan force entities to have a choice only of the one particular
type of medicine? Is there not a right for entities to have a choice of the
types of medical help they wish? Where are the naturopathic, homeopathic,
and chiropractic doctors in this health care plan? Where are those who have
other desires for health care of an alternative nature?
The New
World Order Chugs Slowly Along
All of these things together suggests
that the New World Order isn't coming like a blazing locomotive, but is chugging
very slowly and having considerable difficulty in reaching its destination.
Perhaps this is a good sign that it is being examined carefully from a lot
of different angles so that it not simply push out the Constitution and impose
itself without the masses having any idea of what is going on.
This Awareness indicates that it
does appear that there is some growing resistance to the idea of simply
allowing a NWO to seat itself upon the masses without their invitation and
understanding of what is happening. This Awareness indicates the very act
of people questioning: "What is going on here anyway?", is an act
of preserving freedom. For if you ask the questions and seek to find out,
you are not likely to become victims of some kind of disguised intrusion into
your lives by someone or something that has ulterior purposes. There is no
harm at this time of asking: "What is this all about?" There is
no harm in examining, but come tomorrow or days ahead, these questions may
be forbidden, even as they were once forbidden in Poland and behind the Iron
Curtain in many of the other countries where you could not question authority
for it was forbidden, and you had simply to obey or be exterminated.
This Awareness indicates you still
have freedoms because of the Constitution that is the law of the land, because
of the customs of the land, of the nation, of the culture. Are you yet so
willing to risk your freedoms to try something different simply because some
authorities advocate a New World Order with rousing voices and flags of hope?
This Awareness indicates these hopes, these flags, these rousing voices may
all be part of the slick advertisement of those who would oppress and steal
your freedoms and enslave you under the New World Order.
This Awareness suggests you ask yourself:
What indeed is this New World Order? Is it not or is it perhaps the same thing
as the old world efforts of a few to gain control of the many? For if it is,
we have heard the tune many times before, and it is no different from many
of the old world orders that have existed down through history, except today
it is larger in scope and have many subtle methods of reaching its goal.
A legal
way to get out of the "National Debt"
This Awareness indicates that the
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, all of these things could be thrown out
and
new
rules, new laws, even dictatorial or tyrannical laws could well
be introduced to govern the masses. This would all be legal. This awareness
indicates there are a few entities who recognize that the
Federal
Reserve was set up illegally and the loans from the Federal Reserve
to the country were set up to make loans and notes that were not bonafide
money and therefore, were improperly made, and there are a few people who
see it as a legal way out of the so-called national debt; that the country
declare a national moratorium against the national debt because it was not
legally made.
This Awareness indicates the Federal
Reserve note is but a note not based on U.S,. money, - the dollar, -- he treasury
note being the correct dollar or monetary unit and the Federal Reserve note
being created improperly because it was done unconstitutionally could be seen
as a reason to void the debt that has been created.
This Awareness indicates there are
some entities who understand this clearly. It is questionable whether day
could have the influence necessary to turn this around and prevent the privately
owned Federal Reserve bank from foreclosing on this nation (USA)
