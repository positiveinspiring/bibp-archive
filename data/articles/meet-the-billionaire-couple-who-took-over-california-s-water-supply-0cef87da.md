A newcomer arriving into Californias San Joaquin Valley - the most
lucrative and industrialized agricultural region in the United States -
might think that the entire place is burning.
On the horizon in all directions the brown hue
of the air suggests a distant fire. As the traveler advances along, say,
Highway 99, the fire appears to peel away, a deep stain floating off in the
distance, as if forever clinging to the edges of the sky. Upon moving
farther in, one slowly realizes that the blaze does not recede. The traveler
does not move toward the fire, but within it.
The arid San Joaquin Valley has some of the worst air pollution in the
country, a daily cloud of smog and soot that rises from interstate
automobile traffic, the belching of a few million cows packed into
mega-dairies, the incineration of toxic waste, and the constant fueling of
irrigation pumps and food processing plants - all weaving a faded yellow
curtain that hangs in the air.
In a region where so much is burning, nothing is more valuable than water.
No one knows this better than Stewart and Lynda Resnick,
owners of one of the biggest privately held agribusiness corporations in the
United States -
Roll International - or, as their website
proclaims:
the largest privately held company youve
never heard of.
Rolls holdings include,
-
Paramount Farming, the largest grower
and processor of almonds and pistachios in the world
-
Paramount Citrus
-
Fiji Water
-
Suterra, a pesticide brand
-
Teleflora
-
PomWonderful
-
Neptune Pacific Line, a global shipping
company
A large part of the Resnicks billion-dollar
business entails growing more than 5 million trees in the cracked and dry
Westside soil of the San Joaquin Valley, where rain doesnt fall and rivers
do not flow.
Kern County receives only five inches of
rainfall a year and most of its aquifers have been depleted, contaminated,
or both. None of Paramounts pistachio or almond trees would survive without
the daily application of irrigation water pumped through the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta and down the length of the California Aqueduct.
Over the past two decades, the Resnicks have been at the heart of the most
controversial moves in California water politics. When the Resnicks began
buying land here in the 1980s from Mobil and Texaco, they acquired contracts
for California State Water Project deliveries from the California Aqueduct.
From far behind the scenes they helped rewrite
the contracts that govern the California State Water Project, commandeered a
$74 million dollar state water bank, and encouraged Senator Dianne Feinstein
to intervene on behalf of agribusiness in the conflicts over the ecological
collapse of the Delta.
The Resnicks political involvement is driven by a simple force: money.
The Resnicks have made a lot of it over the past 20 years by hoarding state
water resources in ways now being challenged in court. In a land of
outrageous poverty, the Resnicks have built a billion-dollar fortune by
growing trees with water from an artificial river while the migrant workers
who tend the irrigation pumps dont have access to potable water in their
homes.
The ecology of the entire Central Valley, from Redding to Bakersfield, has
been remade over the past 150 years by the engineered movement of water for
large-scale agriculture in the valley and real estate development on the
coast.
The Westside contains very marginal land that never should have been
irrigated, said Richard Walker, professor of geography at UC Berkeley and
author of The Conquest of Bread: 150 Years of Agribusiness in California.
The California Aqueduct was for the Westside, toxic land.
The Eastside was subdivided and sold in the 1880s for small, lucrative,
irrigated farms, Walker told me.
The good water was developed early, he
said. The post-1940 dams and big canals are to make up for dry areas.
Started during the Great Depression, the federal Central Valley Project
contains 20 dams and 500 miles of canals able to store and move about 9
million acre-feet of water. (An acre-foot is the amount of water necessary
to cover an area of one acre to a depth of one foot, roughly the amount of
water consumed by two families of four in a year.)
Advocates at the time argued that the Central
Valley Project would enable farmers to pump less water from underground.
Instead, growers used the subsidized federal water to bring 3 million new
acres into irrigated production, and continued pumping all the same.
Jealous landowners of vast barren tracts on the Westside of the southern San
Joaquin saw the bonanza of the Central Valley Project and demanded a project
of their own. The result of their lobbying efforts is the California State
Water Project.
Constructed in the 1960s, the project includes
19 dams, 10 energy plants, 20 pumping stations, and a 444-mile concrete
river: the California Aqueduct.
When the Resnicks went shopping for agricultural land in the late 1980s -
looking for a passive investment Stewart Resnick told one reporter - the
Westside is where they went. Soon after the Resnicks bought into the
Westside, multiple drought years between 1987 and 1994 proved that the
artificial bounty of the California Aqueduct would not be enough to protect
their investment.
They needed a back-up plan.
Executives and lawyers working for Paramount thus engineered the takeover of
nearly 20,000 acres of state property where the California Department of
Water Resources had invested $74 million to turn a depleted aquifer
alongside the Kern River into an underground reservoir, or water bank,
capable of storing one million acre-feet of water.
After a series of backroom negotiations, the
state signed over the Kern Water Bank to five water districts and a private
company. The private company, Westside Mutual Water Company, is a paper
company owned by the Resnicks, and the water districts are controlled by
agribusinesses, including Paramount.
The Resnicks water grab hasnt gone unopposed.
On June 3, 2010, the Center for Biological
Diversity and a group of six plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in state court
challenging the private control of the water bank. A separate lawsuit filed
by a smaller pistachio grower alleges that the Resnicks sold water from the
Kern Water Bank for a profit, a violation of state public utilities law.
Still another lawsuit filed by Kern County water
districts asked the court to halt pumping from the bank and investigate how
much water can be drawn without drying up local wells. The Fresno Bee
reported that the water table has fallen by 115 feet in just three years, an
unprecedented drop. Three of the last four years were dry, and almond and
pistachio trees cannot go that long without water.
Beyond the legal technicalities lie larger questions of how vital natural
resources should be managed. With the takeover of the Kern Water Bank, a
public asset that could have been used to supply clean water to nearby
farmworkers towns - and as a drought-relief water bank for both small towns
and farmers - was instead used to safeguard the water supply of almond and
pistachio trees in the desert for a Beverly Hills billionaire couple.
Since taking over the Kern Water Bank, Paramount
has more than doubled its production of almonds and pistachios, becoming the
largest grower and processor of the nuts in the world. And the Resnicks made
the Forbes list of billionaires.
Paramount Farming lists two headquarters:
The contrast could not be sharper.
The Resnicks Beverly Hills home looks more like
an embassy than a house and the couple controls more water than any other
single agribusiness in the state. The farmworkers of Lost Hills live in
mobile homes and cannot drink the water from their taps. The crops they tend
drink better, and cheaper, water than they do.
Lost Hills is entirely flat. There are no hills there, lost or otherwise,
though the Coastal Range foothills can sometimes be seen through the valley
haze some 30 miles off to the west.
But to the casual traveler the place would
probably seem lost.
There is nothing here, Ana Chavez, who
works at the Lost Hills Utility District, told me. This is a forgotten
community. And you know why? Because it is a community of all
Hispanics.
A visit to the town reveals the intertwined
fates of water and migrant laborers in California agriculture: Both are
pulled hundreds of miles from their places of origin and used to extract
wealth from the land.
Lost Hills, which stretches for about two
hundred yards on either side of Highway 46 in the northwestern corner of
Kern County, is a twenty-first century company town.
During the pounding heat of a summer day most people here are out working in
the fields; those at home take refuge indoors from the sun. Only children
seem to venture out, spraying each other with garden hoses and seeking out
patches of shade in which to play. Around 4 p.m., cars and vans start
rolling back into town: Men and women emerge, shoulders hunched, carrying
small coolers, and walk, exhausted, to their doors.
Many stop off at the Village Market store to buy
bottled water or fill up five-gallon jugs at a vending machine.
Bordered by oil fields to the west and surrounded by thousands of acres of
almond and pistachio orchards to the south, north, and east, Lost Hills has
a population of 1,938, according to the 2000 census, and about double that
according to those who live here. There is one traffic light in town; postal
service consists of a small trailer with P.O. boxes. There is no bank, no
pharmacy, and no local government.
All public affairs must be conducted in
Bakersfield, about 40 miles to the southeast.
A small community health clinic, elementary
school, local utility district, and county fire station make up the social
services available. Two small food stores, a barbershop, an auto repair
shop, and three taco trucks, called loncheras, comprise the local commerce.
The nearest place to deposit a check or go to a supermarket is Wasco, 20
miles away.
Lost Hills is 96.7 percent Hispanic according to the census, which also
reports that nearly 70 percent of the population was born in Latin America.
One resident charted the local demographics this way:
There are only two gabacho families here. (Gabacho, a term used widely in Mexico, refers to a
person from the United States.)
The homes are small, single story, simple, and clean, the yards and porches
without clutter.
There are two trailer parks, each with over a hundred
mobile homes slotted one next to the other in rows and circles, everything
sun-bleached and worn, and everything impeccably well cared for. If
abandoned is the first descriptive term to come to mind here, it is followed
soon by dignified.
These are working people, and their work ethic
can be read in their tidy houses and mobile homes and inside their spotless
kitchens. At the same time, the community is unmistakably poor. Thirty
percent of the people in Lost Hills receive incomes below the federal
poverty level. Nearly everyone labors in the fields for minimum wage.
Yet Lost Hills is only one degree of separation from the stuff of fairytale
wealth and glamour, for nearly everyone in town works for the Resnicks.
The Resnicks live in a Beverly Hills mansion on Sunset Boulevard that has
been compared, favorably, to the Palace of Versailles. Amy Wilentz, one of
few writers to gain access to the Resnicks home and publish an account of
her visit, described walking through the Resnicks house with Lynda as like
taking a tour of pre-Revolutionary France.
Wilentz also cited a vanity essay penned by
Lynda Resnick that describes her house as,
topped off on all four sides with rows of
balustrades through which a queen might peek out and utter, Let them
eat cake.
The Los Angeles Business Journal estimates the
Resnicks worth at $1.79 billion.
During the recession, when the San Joaquin
Valley became an epicenter of unemployment and home foreclosures, the
Resnicks saw their fortune grow by about $300 million. During the dry years,
when pumping from the Kern Water Bank caused the local water table to drop
115 feet, the Resnicks were making bank.
The couple is what the nonprofit world likes to
call major donors.
Theyve given over $4 million to political campaigns,
according to a recent California Watch analysis. In 2009, the Resnicks gave
$55 million to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The per capita income
in Lost Hills in 2000 was $8,317. The Resnicks handed the LA art scene more
than double the combined income of the entire population of Lost Hills.
Many of Paramounts 120,000 acres of orchards surround Lost Hills, and the
Paramount Farms processing plant is located about 15 miles away. Everyone I
met in Lost Hills either worked for Paramount, had worked for Paramount, or
was related to someone - or several people - who work for Paramount. All of
the laborers worked for between $8 and $8.65 an hour. No one made more.
Aurelio (the names of current Paramount employees have been changed to
protect their identities) works for Paramount seven days a week for a total
of 62 hours at $8.65 an hour, no overtime. Farm labor is given overtime only
after a 10-hour day and a 60-hour workweek under a law that State Senator
Dean Florez, a Democrat from the nearby town of Shafter, is trying to
change.
Gov. Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill at the end of the 2010
legislative session.
Aurelio is an irrigator; there is no rest for his labor. He has worked at
Paramount for 13 years.
When asked about his lack of a day off, he
responded:
Those little trees always have to get their
water because it is very hot.
Aurelio, his wife, and three children live in a
small, clean mobile home in a trailer park and pay $450 a month in rent.
Aurelio talks about his work as if recounting
tales of adventure - when he speaks his voice lifts and his eyes widen. He
has followed jobs from Mexico City to Texas, Los Angeles to Lost Hills.
He said of his years of labor:
When one likes to work, its very
beautiful.
He had no harsh words for his supervisors or
employers at Paramount, though he did not know much about the latter.
They say just one person is the owner of
all this, he said. but who knows, because its a lot.
They have a runway near the plant, he said of the Resnicks private
airport. Sometimes they visit for New Years. If there is an employee
lunch they get in line for food just like the rest of us. They seem like
good people. They dont behave like they feel they are better than us.
They eat at the same table.
Another Paramount farm-worker, Fernando, hails
from Chiapas in far southern Mexico and has been in Lost Hills for seven
years, scraping together money to send back to his wife and son.
He works 58 hours a week for Paramount: 10 hours
a day during the week and eight on Saturday. He earns $8 an hour.
He said:
Paramount supports you more than others.
They provide equipment. For example, if youre going to apply pesticides
they provide the gloves and goggles; others dont do that.
Asked roughly how many field workers are
undocumented, he said:
If not 100 percent, then the majority. If
they had their papers in order they would get other jobs. Do you really
think that someone with the proper papers is going to be killing
themselves for $8 when at least theyll get $11 at another job?
No one working for Paramount spoke an ill word
of the company, though the family members of employees and ex-employees I
spoke with did.
One man who had worked more than ten years for
the company told of being fired after a knee injury on the job. He had to go
to court to force the company to pay for his surgery. Most other complaints
had to do with the companys low wages.
Throughout the San Joaquin Valley farm-workers are pushed to the outer limits
of labor laws, working the maximum number of hours for the minimum pay. One
can understand a small farmer forced to pay low wages by the brutal hardship
of the global market and competition with larger growers. But if anyone
could pay living wages to employees and still turn a profit, it would be
Paramount.
One woman - who used to work for Paramount and whose two sons work there
now, and who asked that I not use her name because, this is a small town -
said of the Paramount pay scale:
These are hunger wages.
I walked into Paramounts Lost Hills office one
day last July to see if I could speak to someone there.
I was given a phone number in Los Angeles for
Roll International. I called and was asked to call back. I did and was
routed to a recorded message. I left a message after the tone, as
instructed. No one returned my call.
Years earlier, while working on another investigation, I also called Roll
International to request an interview.
That time the receptionist told me straight:
We dont give information to the public.
When I asked her to whom I should address my
research questions she responded,
I suggest you dont research us.
Then she hung up.
The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta used to be the region where the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers would meet, pool for hundreds of square miles, and
slowly drain into the San Francisco Bay and out to sea through the Golden
Gate. Not anymore.
The San Joaquin River is mostly diverted for
irrigation before it can reach the Delta and the Sacramento is largely
lifted out of the southern tip of the Delta and pumped down the San Joaquin
Valley for irrigation.
Today, the Delta is a work of human engineering built over 150 years that
consists of thousands of miles of levees, emaciated river flows, immense
pumps, bromide and mercury contamination, endangered species, and below sea
level islands housing communities and farms that would most likely be
under water within hours of a major earthquake.
The Delta is the hub of Californias water engineering system and the
current focal point of the states infamous water wars.
Environmentalists
and Delta communities want to reduce water exports. Irrigators in the San
Joaquin and their strange bedfellows in the powerful Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California, which draws water pumped through the Delta,
want to increase water exports. There is one thing all sides agree on: The
Delta is a disaster waiting to explode.
In 2005, populations of several fish species used to gauge the overall
health of the Delta ecosystem plummeted toward extinction.
The Delta is ill. Gravely ill, wrote
Contra Costa Times reporter Mike Taugher at the beginning of a five-part
investigative series on the ecological crisis in the Delta. After
decades of decline, the Deltas vital signs have suddenly plunged to new
depths.
Several Delta fish species hang on the verge of
collapse, but the tiny, endangered Delta Smelt has become the cause célèbre
for environmental lawsuits seeking to stop Delta pumping and the bête noir
for agribusiness lobbyists who claim that attempts to save the inch-long
minnow come at the expense of jobs.
But the idea of a battle between fish and farmers is a false dichotomy.
The
fish in question is an indicator species; its extinction represents
full-scale ecosystem failure. The farmers in question represent the largest
agribusiness firms in the country who face not bankruptcy, but simply a
limit on the amount of water they can rely upon from the Delta.
The battle in the Delta is not one of fish v.
farmers, but collapse v. reliability.
We have a system where we try to deliver
more water than can be reliably delivered. All the signals tell us that
we have been exceeding the capacities of the system, said Tina Swanson,
executive director and chief scientist at the Bay Institute.
It is incontrovertible that we have to
expect to export less water from the Delta than we have in the past; it
is unsustainable. Were going to have to learn to make do with less.
Making do with less is blasphemy in San Joaquin
Valley agribusiness.
Every major water development in the region has
been predicated on the idea of staring collapse in the face and demanding
more: the Central Valley Project, the State Water Project, the Kern Water
Bank, and the current drive to spend another $11 billion in bond funds to
build more dams and canals and gun the motor of an engine already on the
cusp of failure.
Yet making do with less is an unrelenting reality for the people who work in
the fields picking fruits and vegetables and tending to the almond and
pistachio trees of these same agribusinesses.
There is this sense that farmworkers
prosper only when the farmers do, but thats not true at all. The
farm-workers dont prosper even when the farmers do, said Caroline
Farrell, acting executive director of the Center on Race, Poverty & the
Environment in Delano.
Farrell said that the fish versus farmers
spin is just one more way of exploiting farm-workers. Theres no talk of
paying farm-workers just wages.
Indeed, the California Farm Bureau supports the
water bond measure to build more dams. It also lobbied successfully against
Senator Florezs bill to overhaul farm labor overtime rules.
In 2003, I interviewed Paramount Farmings resource planning manager, Scott
Hamilton. At the time I was researching the Kern Water Bank and its
potential use for water marketing.
Hamilton said that water sales were not
Paramounts main interest.
Were in a situation of growing almonds and
pistachios without a firm water supply, so we went into the Kern Water
Bank to secure a water supply, he said.
True enough. When I asked Aurelio if, during his
13 years working as an irrigator at Paramount a tree had ever died from lack
of water, his answer came without a hint of uncertainty: No.
The farm-workers in the region are not so lucky.
If you are poor and a farm-worker, then you
dont have clean water, said Susana De Anda, co-director of the
Community Water Center in Visalia, an organization dedicated to
advocating for potable water in the valley.
You pay water rates between $50 and $100 a
month for water that you cant drink, and then you have to spend more on
bottled water.
Farm-workers in the San Joaquin Valley have
effectively had their water privatized.
Their communities have been left out of the
major water projects. The groundwater basins have been depleted and
contaminated by pesticides and nitrates from the very agribusinesses that
employ them. Little to no state funding makes it to their local water
systems, leaving them to buy bottled water at the store or from a vending
machine.
Meanwhile, the Resnicks, in what would seem a
scripted irony, own
Fiji Water,
the #1 premier bottled water in the US.
The lack of access to clean and safe drinking
water in farm-worker communities speaks to decades of exclusion from federal
and state water development.
The exclusion is not only a question of bitter
histories, but also current policy.
The $11.2 billion dollar water bond that
Governor Schwarzenegger shifted from the 2010 to the 2012 ballot targets
less than one percent of its funds for disadvantaged communities in the San
Joaquin and other regions, according to an analysis of the bond by the
Environmental Justice Coalition for Water.
The bond does not take the issue of potable
water into consideration, De Anda said. It is a project for the
growers. Potable water should be first, and priority should be given to
the people who do not have access.
While the residents of Lost Hills are forced to
buy expensive bottled water or suffer the consequences of drinking
contaminated water, the Resnicks, with their control over the Kern Water
Bank, have stored enough water to fill San Franciscos Hetch Hetchy
reservoir - twice.
Court records show that in early 2007, the
Resnicks had 755,868 acre feet in the Kern Water Bank, enough to keep their
trees blooming during both a statewide drought and a global recession.
Standing by the Glacier vending machine in Lost Hills one day, I met a
19-year-old woman from Michoacán who migrated to Chicago at age nine with
her family before relocating to Lost Hills in 2008. She works a night shift,
from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m., picking bell peppers for $8 an hour. If she works
hard, she said, in a month she can save $300.
Asked if she drinks the tap water in her home
she said no, that,
it tastes nasty and they tell us not to
drink it.
So every three days she fills up her jug.
On a blazing July day, she pushed her full,
5-gallon jug of drinking water from the vending machine back to her house in
a baby carriage. About two hundred yards down the road, the California
Aqueduct was full and flowing fast.
