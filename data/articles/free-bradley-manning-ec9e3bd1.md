I have a confession to make: I have been on the fence about
Bradley
Manning as the drama of his detention and
the
WikiLeaks documents have unfolded.
While I believe deeply that those who leak
classified materials are acting out of conscience and for the good of the
people, I also believe criminal acts - even ones of conscience - must be met
with punishment as required in any society that wishes to live by the rule
of law. Arrest and detention are part of any illegal act of civil
disobedience, and are to be expected as the natural consequence of such an
act.
Chain yourself to a fence, and expect to be arrested for trespassing. Pour
blood on the nose cone of a nuclear missile, and expect to be arrested for
destruction of property.
The threat of arrest, detention and possible
conviction is part of the package that is civil disobedience, and those who
take part in it must accept the consequences as part of their act of
conscience.
Indeed, it is the acceptance of punishment that lies at the
heart of that conscience:
they are breaking a law to highlight a
wrong, are willing to be punished to underscore that wrong, and in doing
so, demonstrate how far they are personally willing to go in order to
end that wrong and inspire others in the process.
That's where I've been with Bradley Manning -
his was an act of conscience that broke the law, and the consequences of
that act must be accepted - until now.
How wrong I was.
This situation goes far beyond such a simplistic cut-and-dried viewpoint. It
cuts to the core of what we are as a nation, what we wish to be, and what
must be done to honor the values we pay so much lip service to, even as we
fail time and again to practice what we preach. What Manning has been
charged with goes far beyond an act of conscience; they were, in fact, an
attempt to save the very soul of these United States.
It is widely considered facile and weak to make Nazi comparisons in any
argument, but unfortunately for every citizen of this country, the
comparison here is all too apt. During the Nuremberg trials in the aftermath
of World War II, accused war criminals were often heard to claim, "I was
only following orders," as a means of justifying their savage and barbaric
activities.
The excuse was rejected out of hand, further
enshrining the idea that soldiers and officers are more than mere automatons
who are expected only to do as they are told. Criminal acts, even in a
military situation, are not to be condoned, coddled or tolerated.
Men were hanged by the judges at Nuremberg to
emphasize the point.
And here is Bradley Manning, who like every enlisted American soldier, swore
an oath to support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
against enemies both foreign and domestic, and to bear true faith and
allegiance to the same.
That same oath requires the oath-taker to follow
the orders of the president and superior officers, but if those hanged men
at Nuremberg prove anything, it is that unlawful orders are by definition
void, and should not be followed if the oath sworn to the Constitution is to
mean anything at all.
Make no mistake: the documents Bradley Manning has been accused of leaking
are prima facie evidence of illegal orders being given and executed all
along the chain of command.
This has been made even more abundantly clear
with the recent revelation of some 700 pages of documents detailing the
ongoing travesty that is America's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
According to
various reports:
The files depict a system often focused less
on containing dangerous terrorists or enemy fighters, than on extracting
intelligence. Among inmates who proved harmless were an 89-year-old
Afghan villager, suffering from senile dementia, and a 14-year-old boy
who had been an innocent kidnap victim.
A number of British nationals and residents were held for years even
though US authorities knew they were not Taliban or al-Qaida members.
One Briton, Jamal al-Harith, was rendered to Guantánamo simply because
he had been held in a Taliban prison and was thought to have knowledge
of their interrogation techniques.
The US military tried to hang on to
another Briton, Binyam Mohamed, even after charges had been dropped and
evidence emerged he had been tortured.
The files also detail how many innocents or marginal figures swept up by
the Guantánamo dragnet because US forces thought they might be of some
intelligence value.
One man was transferred to the facility "because he was a mullah, who
led prayers at Manu mosque in Kandahar province, Afghanistan ... which
placed him in a position to have special knowledge of the Taliban". US
authorities eventually released him after more than a year's captivity,
deciding he had no intelligence value.
Another prisoner was shipped to the base "because of his general
knowledge of activities in the areas of Khowst and Kabul based as a
result of his frequent travels through the region as a taxi driver".
The files also reveal that an al-Jazeera journalist was held at
Guantánamo for six years, partly in order to be interrogated about the
Arabic news network.
Also illuminated in these leaked documents is
the shameful use of torture, described through the cruel euphemism of
"enhanced interrogation," that was rampant at Guantanamo Bay.
Thanks to such disgraceful practices, the
prisoners currently detained there now find themselves in a ridiculous legal
limbo; they may be innocent or guilty, but because they were tortured, they
cannot be brought to trial because evidence obtained against them was
gathered illegally. The Obama administration, like the Bush administration
before, refuses to let the legal process do its work, nor are they willing
to release these prisoners, so there they sit.
In a filthy irony, Bradley Manning was exposed to a number of grotesquely
similar "stress tactics" used against Guantanamo prisoners while detained at
Quantico.
He was deprived of sleep, humiliated and berated by his captors,
isolated, exposed to cold, and made to stand naked for extended periods of
time. Such acts are straight out of the War on Terror handbook, and like the
prisoners at Guantanamo, were used against a man who has yet to be convicted
of anything.
The mistreatment tactics against prisoners that
Manning allegedly exposed have been used against him, one more crime in a
symphony of crimes.
Bradley Manning sits today in Leavenworth prison awaiting a hearing to
determine whether or not he will face a court martial. The case against him
seems as disorganized and specious as the cases against many of the
prisoners at Guantanamo, but let us accept for the moment that he did, in
fact, release those classified documents. If so, he should be thanked for
his actions.
As Glenn Greenwald
so eloquently argued,
"WikiLeaks is responsible for more
newsworthy scoops over the last year than all media outlets combined:
it's not even a close call. And if Bradley Manning is the leaker, he has
done more than any other human being in our lifetime to bring about
transparency and shine a light on what military and government power is
doing."
Moreover, if there is actually justice to be
found in this morally crippled nation, Bradley Manning should be cleared of
all charges and released.
His was not some casual act of disobedience, nor
was it an attack against his country. Bradley Manning was fulfilling the
oath he swore to protect and defend the Constitution. He exposed serial
criminal acts perpetrated by his superiors, which is a moral necessity for
anyone who has taken such an oath.
We know the truth of the acts made by both the
Bush and
Obama
administrations in Guantanamo, and they are illegal on their face.
We are a
better nation today because we know this, and we have Bradley Manning to
thank for it. By exposing war crimes, he has been labeled a criminal even
before any hearings have been held. He has been mistreated in a way you
would not treat a dog. He showed us the war crimes committed in our name,
and has been crushed for it.
Justice demands his release.
Furthermore, justice demands a wide inquiry into
the criminal acts of both the Bush and Obama administrations as pertaining
to the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere.
Justice demands
prosecution for those acts against the real criminals responsible for them.
They have driven our nation into the gutter, and
to punish Bradley Manning for attempting to haul us back from that abyss is
to admit, in broad daylight and with no shame, that justice has no meaning
anymore.
