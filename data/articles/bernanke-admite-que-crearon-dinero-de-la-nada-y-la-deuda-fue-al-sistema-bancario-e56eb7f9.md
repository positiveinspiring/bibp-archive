El presidente de
la FED Ben Bernanke admitió la semana pasada que el banco
central creó 1.3 billones de dólares de la nada, para comprar valores que
respaldasen las hipotecas.
Esta chocante admisión llegó en una sesión del
Comité Económico Unido de USA reunido en Capital Hill la semana pasada. Bernanke, ni más ni menos que, afirmó con la cabeza cuando el representante
de la cámara Ron Paul le dijo:
Así que, ¿de dónde sacaron el dinero?. Ustedes crearon este dinero. De esa
forma, ustedes monetizaron la deuda, y esta fue a parar al sistema bancario
Lo más fuerte es que
los medios de comunicación de masas no han cubierto
esta noticia.

expertas que hablan con tanta seguridad sobre el origen de los problemas
del sistema financiero)
Bernanke Admits Printing $1.3 Trillion Out Of Thin Air

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke admitted the central bank created $1.3 trillion
out of thin air to buy mortgage backed securities. This shocking admission
came from the Joint Economic Committee hearing on Capital Hill last week.
I
was dumbfounded when I saw Bernanke shake his head in the affirmative as
Representative Ron Paul said,
Well, where did you get the money? You
created this money. So you did monetize debt, and that went into the banking
system.
I was amazed he admitted this. I looked up the original hearing on
C-Span to make sure the clip was not edited. It was not.
What is even more shocking is I could not find a single mainstream news
agency that covered this revelation. Congress just finished voting on the
bitterly contested Obama health care bill that is supposed to cost nearly a
trillion dollars over ten years. (Some contend it will be more than twice
that amount.)
The
mainstream media doesnt even bat an eye over
the Fed
creating $1.3 trillion in a little more than a year to buy worthless debt no
one else will touch. I do not get it. I guess we could have asked the Fed to
print up a trillion dollars to pay for health care and avoided that drawn
out battle in Congress.
Then, Rep. Paul brings up printing another $105 billion to bailout Greece.
Bernanke answers by saying,
...I think one of the agreements that the
G20 leaders came up with was sort of a mutual commitment to put more money
into the IMF as a way of addressing the financial crisis around the world...
Notice how Bernanke used the term mutual commitment.
I think what that
really means is an agreement between all the G-20 nations of a mutual
debasement of their currencies. I think this is why gold has been rising in
price around the globe. I have been saying for months that we are going to
have some very big inflation. (Real inflation is already at 9.5% according
to
shadowstats.com.)
I wrote about this last November in a post called The
Fix Is In.
I think Bernanke just opened the Fed playbook and revealed money will be
printed to fix all financial problems. I dont think hes even trying to
hide it anymore. Rep. Paul also brought up the big debt trouble coming soon
with many, many bankrupt cities and states such as Los Angeles and
California. I think they will all be bailed out one way or another by the
printing press.
New York Fed President William Dudley seems to be on the same page as his
boss. Dudley recently said,
The fact that our foreign indebtedness is for
the most part denominated in our own currency is a huge advantage in the
event the dollar were to come under significant downward pressure.
(Zero
Hedge has a complete text of Dudleys speech,
click here)
Is Dudley making a
not so subtle hint about devaluing the U.S. dollar? Once again, I say yes.
Anyone with a savings account or money market denominated in dollars should
be terrified.
You have scrimped and saved only to have the Fed print money
and devalue what you have worked so hard for! Inflation has been chosen for
you by the Federal Reserve, and we the taxpayers cant even audit its
actions.
Below is the video from the Joint Economic Committee Hearing last
week.
Watch for yourself Bernanke nod yes to printing
$1.3 trillion...
