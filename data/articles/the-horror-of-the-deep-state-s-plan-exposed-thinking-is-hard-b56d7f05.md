THE HORROR! THE HORROR!
Part 1
I'm constantly amazed by the ability of those in power to create a narrative trusted by a gullible non-critical thinking populace.
Appealing to emotions, when you have millions of functionally illiterate, normalcy bias ensnared, iGadget distracted, disciples of the status quo, has been the game plan of the Deep State for the last century.
Americans don't want to think, because thinking is hard. They would rather feel.
For decades the government controlled public education system has performed a mass lobotomy on their hapless matriculates, removing their ability to think and replacing it with feelings, fabricated dogma, and social indoctrination.
Their minds of mush have been molded to acquiesce to the narrative propagandized by their government keepers.
"The problem isn't that Johnny can't read. The problem isn't even that Johnny can't think. The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is; he confuses it with feeling." Thomas Sowell
"The problem isn't that Johnny can't read. The problem isn't even that Johnny can't think. The problem is that Johnny doesn't know what thinking is; he confuses it with feeling."
Thomas Sowell
With a majority confused, distracted, malleable, willfully ignorant, and easily manipulated by false narratives, heart wrenching images, and fake news, the Deep State henchmen have been able to control the masses with relative ease.
The unanticipated rise of Donald Trump to the most powerful role in the world gave many critical thinking, anti-big government, skeptical curmudgeons hope he could drain the swamp and begin to deconstruct the massive out of control Federal bureaucracy.
His rhetoric during the campaign about,
repealing the disastrous Obamacare abortion cutting taxes dismantling Federal regulatory red tape making Mexico pay for the wall dumping Yellen favoring higher interest rates not interfering militarily in countries who are not threatening the United States,
repealing the disastrous Obamacare abortion
cutting taxes
dismantling Federal regulatory red tape
making Mexico pay for the wall
dumping Yellen
favoring higher interest rates
not interfering militarily in countries who are not threatening the United States,
...appealed to many libertarian minded people.
I've watched with disgust over the last month as the promises of non-interventionism by a presidential candidate have been broken by the third consecutive president.
George W. Bush promised a humble foreign policy with no nation building.
He had criticized the Clinton-Gore Administration for being too interventionist:
"If we don't stop extending our troops all around the world in nation-building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road. And I'm going to prevent that."
"If we don't stop extending our troops all around the world in nation-building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road.
And I'm going to prevent that."
With 9/11 as a convenient excuse, he invaded sovereign countries based on flawed data, passed the 4th Amendment destroying Patriot Act, allowed neo-cons to create a Orwellian surveillance state, and permitted the military industrial complex to regain its power and control over the political apparatus in Washington D.C.
With no Cold War to fill their coffers, neo-cons in Congress, warmongering think tank co-conspirators, military brass and their arms dealer cronies needed to create a new war to keep the racket going.
The War on Terror is unwinnable because you can't defeat a tactic, and that is just what the Deep State is counting on.
An unwinnable war, like the War on Drugs and War on Poverty, results in never ending funding, no evaluation of success or failure, continuous propaganda designating new enemies whenever convenient, and a narrative questioning the patriotism of anyone who argues against foreign interventionism.
After Bush's reign of error, the election of a liberal community activist as president surely would result in a dramatic reduction in military intervention around the world.
It was so certain, Obama was awarded the Nobel 'Peace' Prize for just being elected for promising hope and change. He ran against neo-con tool McCain who never met a country he didn't want to invade.
Obama's words as a candidate echoed those of Bush Jr. before he was placed on the throne by the Powers That Be.
"We continue to be in a war that should never have been authorized. I am proud of the fact that way back in 2002, I said that this war was a mistake."
After being elected Obama immediately changed his tune about the business of war.
He withdrew troops from Iraq as required by the agreement signed by Bush with the Iraq puppet government, but he ramped up the never ending Afghanistan war - now sixteen years old and still not won.
The vacuum left by our epic failure in Iraq allowed the rise of ISIS.
Obama essentially created ISIS by providing arms to "moderate" rebels fighting Assad in Syria.
By the end of his term, troops were back in Iraq and more are on the way. Obama and a Secretary of State named Clinton decided to overthrow Gaddafi even though he posed no threat to U.S. interests.
They have left a lawless chaotic failed state, now home to ISIS, Al Qaeda, and various other terrorist factions.
Obama should have won the Nobel Drone Prize as he launched ten times as many attacks as Bush, killing thousands, blowing up wedding parties, and murdering hundreds of innocent civilians. He bombed seven countries even though we are not officially at war with anyone. He renewed all aspects of the unconstitutional Patriot Act.
Edward Snowden revealed the mass surveillance on all Americans by Obama's spy agencies.
His continued support for the overthrow of Assad, so Saudi Arabia and Qatar could build a natural gas pipeline to Europe, was thwarted by Putin.
Hysterically, after eight years of war mongering and expansion of the warfare/welfare surveillance state, Obama is now portrayed as a pacifist.
The fact is Obama, like Bush, filled his role in the imperial empire, policing the world, enriching the military industrial complex, and doing the bidding of his Deep State sponsors.
Now we have Donald Trump, the billionaire champion of the common man, who campaigned on getting out of the nation building business.
Where have I heard that before...?
Exactly one year ago, Trump gave a foreign policy speech laying out his vision for the U.S. role in the world.
"We're getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades."

He scorned Obama and Bush's foolish attempt at creating western style democracies in 3rd world den of snakes, inhabited by factions of Muslim religious fanatics.
He railed against the trillions wasted fighting worthless wars, leaving countries in anarchy, and allowing terrorists organizations like ISIS to fill the vacuum.
His arguments sounded like they were being spoken by Ron Paul...
He clearly ran as a non-interventionist.
"We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy. We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment."

Trump rationally promised to have peaceful relations with the other two nuclear superpowers.
He was diplomatic, lucid and non-confrontational when talking about the two countries neo-cons love to hate.
His promises of improved relations lasted about as long as it took the Deep State to create a blatant false flag in Syria.
"We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests. Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries."

There seems to be a common theme when it comes to how all presidents end up doing the bidding of the military industrial complex as soon as they settle into the Oval Office, no matter what they said during their campaigns.
Trump is the latest example of talking diplomacy, no nation building, non-interventionism, and not putting boots on the ground, and then doing the exact opposite within weeks of taking office.
The game plan is tried and true. The Deep State either creates or provokes a false flag event to set in motion the pressure to respond militarily.
They utilize their propaganda emitting media mouthpieces to spread disinformation and create the opinions of the non-critical thinking masses. Dramatic visual images and a storyline with an evil villain are essential to properly influencing a pliable, easily misled, oblivious public.
The use of false flag events, fake news, and staged graphic photographs to control and manipulate public opinion has been utilized for decades by the Deep State to push the country into military conflict craved by the military industrial complex.
We've known for almost a century war is a racket, as described by General Smedley Butler in 1935.
"War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives."
"War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope.
It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives."
We were warned by the most respected general of the 20th Century about allowing the military industrial complex to gain control over our government and politicians.
Eisenhower experienced the influence of the Deep State from the military perspective and firsthand as president.
Sadly, his hopes for an alert and knowledgeable citizenry keeping the military industrial complex under wraps were dashed on the shoals of a purposefully failing public education system and a relentless propaganda campaign championing never ending war.
"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together." Dwight D. Eisenhower

Those controlling the levers of power have understood the power of propaganda since Edward Bernays taught them how to manipulate the public mind with his theories of propaganda in 1928.
He believed the masses were driven by biological urges which needed to be channeled and guided by highly intelligent corporate elite overseers.
His contempt for the masses was born out in his corporate fascist view of the world.
He believed our dangerous animalistic urges needed to be subdued to keep society sedate and controllable by those constituting the invisible government (aka Deep State).
He trained the controllers to use propaganda in order to mold the minds of the masses in a way most beneficial to the state.
"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind." Edward Bernays - Propaganda

Edward Bernays - Propaganda
The use of propaganda and the flogging of false flag narratives by the corporate media acting as mouthpieces for the Deep State has worked wonders and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American boys and innocent victims (collateral damage according to neo-cons) around the world.
An explosion that sunk the USS Maine was used by William Randolph Hearst and William McKinley to provoke a war with Spain in 1898.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a false flag used by LBJ and the war party in 1964 to kick off the Vietnam War, resulting in over 58,000 American deaths, 153,000 Americans wounded, hundreds of thousands mentally scarred for life, and the deaths of over 2 million Vietnamese.
For who...? For what...?
The American boys sacrificed on the altar of the Deep State were nothing but cannon fodder in the warped minds of McNamara, LBJ, Westmorland and the rest of warmongering elitists.
Only the military industrial complex benefited, as the burgeoning welfare/warfare state resulted in raging inflation during the 1970s.
As time passed, the propagandists have become immensely more sophisticated in their messaging, psychological assessment of a dumbed down American populace, and manipulation of patriotism, symbolism and emotions to run roughshod over those opposing nonsensical, illegal, and immoral military intervention around the world.
The most successful technique utilized by the Deep State for the last few decades has been "atrocity propaganda".
Appealing to the emotions of people who have been indoctrinated by government schooling to feel rather than think has been wildly successful in controlling the agenda.
Atrocity propaganda was initially employed to sway public opinion to support the First Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, engineered by Madison Avenue maggots from Hill and Knowlton on behalf of the Kuwaiti government.
In emotional testimony before Congress an unidentified 15 year old girl, who happened to be the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S., gave false testimony that she had witnessed Iraqi soldiers take babies out of incubators in a Kuwaiti hospital, take the incubators, and leave the babies to die.
This propaganda successfully convinced a clueless public to support our involvement in the Gulf War. With the end of the Cold War, how could the military industrial complex generate immense profits without enemies?
Afterwards, Stormin Norman Schwarzkopf was glorified as the brilliant courageous hero. The masses need a hero to worship.
Whether 9/11 was a false flag or a monumental security blunder, it was hijacked by the neo-con faction within the government to wage perpetual war and turn our country into a surveillance state.
A critical thinking citizen or honest journalist might wonder how the 342 page Patriot Act, which changed 15 existing laws and created entire new agencies, could be written, debated, and signed into law within 45 days of the 9/11 attack.
It almost seemed like it was already written, awaiting the opportune time to implement. The War on Terror had begun.
The Deep State managed to create a war against a tactic, which could never be won. It has done wonders for the military industrial complex, as arms industry stocks have risen 400% to 500% since 2001 versus the 100% rise in the SandP 500.
War is a profitable racket...
The neo-cons immediately began their propaganda campaign to invade Iraq, even though they had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11. There were virtually no religious Muslim zealots inhabiting the country. Hussein hated bin Laden and his ilk.
The propaganda machine, driven by Cheney and Wolfowitz, churned out false stories about 9/11 involvement and the imminent threat from Hussein using "WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION".
The Colin Powell show on national TV convinced the fearful American populace to support the invasion of a country who threatened us in no way, without a declaration of war from Congress.
The invasion of Iraq set the precedent that presidents can wage war around the globe with no legislative approval.
The invasion became a reality TV show called Shock and Awe. In retrospect, the Iraq War was either a colossal error of judgment or exactly what the Deep State had in mind.
The ultimate financial cost of our Middle East adventures will exceed $6 trillion, while 4,400 young men gave their lives, 32,000 were badly wounded, thousands more are afflicted with PTSD, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed or maimed, all for a worthless cause. Iraq is now a failed state, with Muslim terrorists controlling large swaths of territory.
The warnings from men of stature, integrity and nobility like,
Smedley Butler Dwight D. Eisenhower Ron Paul,
Smedley Butler
Ron Paul,
...have gone unheeded by an increasingly dumbed down, iGadget absorbed, intellectually lazy, willfully ignorant, emotionally stunted populace.
They question nothing. They believe whatever the boob tube tells them to believe. Their extreme level of normalcy bias allows the Deep State to maintain control and become outrageously bold in their lies, misinformation, and ability to convince the masses of the most ridiculous narratives.
Only one voice in the wilderness remains.
Speaking truth to power only creates change if an educated populace says enough is enough.
"How did the American people ever reach this point where they believe that US aggression in the Middle East will make us safe when it does the opposite? How did the American people ever reach the point where they believe that fighting unconstitutional wars is required to protect our freedoms and our Constitution? Why do we allow the NSA, CIA, FBI, TSA, etc. to destroy our liberty at home, as part of the Global War on Terror, with a pretext that they are preserving our liberty? Why are the lying politicians reelected and allowed to bankrupt our country, destroy our money, and enter wars without the proper consent? Why do the American people suffer in silence and not scream 'Enough is enough!'? We've had enough of the 'humanitarian do-gooders' and the proponents of 'American exceptionalism' who give us nothing but war, economic suffering, and less freedom. This can and must be stopped."

In Part Two (below) of this article I will detail various recent false flag and propaganda episodes which are being used by the Deep State to push the world toward war.
The acceleration of events based on false narratives, appeals to patriotism, and fake news puts the lives of millions at risk, with no comprehension of how they are being manipulated through propaganda techniques refined to a science. Imperial empires always fall due to their hubris and military overreach.
We are being led into a heart of immense darkness...

In Part One of this article I detailed how propaganda has been utilized by the Deep State for decades to control the minds of the masses and allow those in control to reap the benefits of never ending war. In this Part Two I will discuss recent events, false flags, and propaganda campaigns utilized by the Deep State to push the world to the brink of war.

"We penetrated deeper and deeper
into the heart of darkness"
The use of graphic images, electronically transmitted across the world in an instant, along with a consistent false narrative promoted by the captured corporate media, is the preferred means of appealing to the emotions of those who want to believe atrocity propaganda.
Instigating a march to war through the use of unfounded fear, misinformation, staged photo ops, and appealing to passions and prejudices was as revolting to Albert Einstein in the 1930s as it is today to normal thinking individuals.
"He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would fully suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, senseless brutality, deplorable love-of-country stance, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action! It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder." Albert Einstein

It seems the level and intensity of the propaganda campaigns has ratcheted up dramatically in the last half dozen years and appears to be reaching a crescendo as we speak.
It's almost as if 'they' (The Deep State - The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government) are frantically trying to maintain the status quo, even as the worldwide financial Ponzi scheme of debt approaches the point of collapse.
The domestic conditions in Europe, North America, and Asia are deteriorating rapidly. The propaganda doled out trying to convince citizens their financial situation is not worsening has failed. The people realize they have been screwed and continue to be screwed by the politicians, bankers and corporate fascists running the show.
This is the major reason Trump was elected. People were desperate for someone who offered them a promise of economic revival and reduced government interference in their lives. The problem is no one is capable of saving the US Titanic. The iceberg was struck sixteen years ago when the Deep State engineered a plundering campaign driving the national debt from $5.8 trillion to $20 trillion, and unfunded welfare liabilities to $200 trillion.
Unpaid for tax cuts will not save us. Unpaid for shovel ready infrastructure projects will not save us.
Threatening foreign countries with tariffs will not bring manufacturing jobs back. Excessively low interest rates will not spur investment, but it will create a pension crisis and impoverish senior citizens. Devaluing your currency when every country in the world attempts the same "solution" will not work.
Passing an Obamacare lite healthcare plan that keeps mega-corporation insurance companies and hospitals in charge solves nothing. The demographic time bomb of boomers turning 65 cannot be reversed.
Providing the appearance of normalcy and improvement by artificially boosting the stock and real estate markets to all-time bubble highs only makes the coming crash that much more devastating. It is clearly evident to me the drumbeat of war is louder than it has been in decades as this Fourth Turning enters its ninth year. Every previous U.S. Fourth Turning has climaxed with a more horrific war than the previous, as the technological "advances" allow the Deep State controllers to create cannon fodder more efficiently.
The year 2011 seems to have been the nexus for the Deep State to create new enemies and sow the seeds of discontent and revolution around the globe. U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq in 2011, while troop levels in Afghanistan remained low. The neo-cons were running out of conflicts to keep the profits flowing.
The U.S. economy was headed back into recession as the temporary effects of the Fed's QE heroin injection and Obama's massive porkulus plan were leading to the inevitable drug withdrawal and fall back into recession.
The Deep State managers had to act fast. They needed new enemies, more wars and more QE. Was it just a coincidence Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in Egypt during 2011 while the U.S. stood by and did nothing?
After the democratically elected replacement turned out to be a Muslim extremist, we fully supported the next coup which placed a military dictator in charge. He just got a grand welcome from Trump a few weeks ago.
I guess military dictators are OK when they do what we say. A dictator who had the nerve to not honor the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice in his kingdom, Muammar Gaddafi, was swiftly overthrown and killed by a NATO force led by the U.S. in 2011.
A stable country was turned into a terrorist haven overnight. It's now a lawless hellhole inhabited by ISIS, Al Qaeda, and various other Muslim terrorist factions.
Along with the vacuum left in Iraq, Libya became a breeding ground for terrorists, armed by the U.S. Shockingly, after decades of stability, factions within Syria began a civil war against Assad and his government in 2011. Do you see a connection yet?
Just as U.S. military presence in the Middle East began to wane, all hell began breaking out across the region. McCain and his band of neo-con world changers helped arm the "moderate rebels" fighting against the suddenly evil Assad.
These moderates became ISIS, who now suddenly became the new bogeyman to be feared by Americans, as professionally produced videos of beheadings and other atrocities began to be disseminated by the mainstream media. The War on Terror had a new jolt of gusto and increased funding for more military miss-adventures.
The propagandists ignored the inconvenient fact Assad was fighting against ISIS and Al Qaeda. They ignored the fact Assad ruled over a secular country - not a country run by religious American hating Muslim zealots.
Fighting against Assad and ISIS doubled the arms dealers' profits... Then Russia threw a monkey wrench into the Deep State plans. They fully supported Assad as an ally because they need his ports. The real reason Assad was attacked was because Saudi Arabia and Qatar need to build their natural gas pipeline across Syria to reach Europe.
Virtually all of Europe is dependent upon Russia to supply their natural gas.
The Deep State's retaliation for Putin's support of Assad was to overthrow the democratically elected president of the Ukraine who had rejected NATO for a closer partnership with Russia.
The U.S. instigated coup and installation of a subservient puppet led Putin to put Crimea under Russian control and support Ukrainian rebels as they fought the new regime. This dramatic increase in tensions between NATO and Russia again generated more profits for the military industrial complex. Missiles and troops are pouring into the NATO countries surrounding Russia. The American propaganda specialists now had their new enemies.
Syria and Russia, with Iran and North Korea providing occasional fear mongering diversions, became the focus of the neo-cons and their pliant media mouthpieces.
The false flag downing of a Malaysian airliner over the Ukraine was blamed on Putin and Russia.
No radar proof or physical evidence was ever presented implicating the Ukrainian rebels. They were winning the civil war and the U.S./NATO needed to turn world opinion against Putin. The first attempt at a false flag gas attack in Syria occurred in 2013, as the U.S. backed rebels murdered over 500 innocent victims in an attempt to turn world opinion against Assad and provoke NATO involvement on par with Libya.
When this atrocity propaganda failed to work, the Deep State turned to heartstring pulling photographs of dead and injured children, with a consistent narrative spewed by every media pundit as instructed by the controllers.
The first atrocity propaganda photo was in 2015, functioning as twofer on the propaganda scale.
The picture of a three year old Syrian boy who drowned when his boat from Turkey to Greece capsized was spread across the world on every media outlet for a week as faux outrage against Assad and Putin was ramped up to hysterical levels.
The 'evil Assad' had caused this refugee crisis, even though it was the rebels who started the war.
The blame for this tragic death was solely due to his father's recklessness. The entire family lived in Turkey for three years and was not forced to go to Europe. The father was being funded from a relative in Canada and wanted to go to Europe for dental work.
The picture was also used to promote the continued Muslim invasion of Europe.
How could Europeans turn away these 'nice people'? George Soros' master plan was working perfectly.
A year later Aleppo boy was the latest atrocity photo used to reverse public opinion against Assad and Putin, as their military success against ISIS, Al Qaeda and the U.S. supported rebels endangered the Deep State plan.
As usual, the American public swallowed the propaganda, hook, line and sinker.
The picture suddenly appeared and was disseminated on every mainstream media outlet in the country for days, with pontificating pundits tearfully portraying Assad as a butcher.
No context, no proof he was injured by government forces, and no proof it wasn't just a staged photo op like previous attempts.
This last ditch attempt to convince the world to support a Syrian invasion also failed. This atrocity propaganda game loses its impact on a video game addicted, ADD ridden, SJW populace fairly quickly. Private citizen Donald Trump was unequivocal in his opposition to Syrian intervention before being elevated to the presidency, as shown in these tweets:
Many Syrian 'rebels' are radical Jihadis. Not our friends and supporting them doesn't serve our national interest. Stay out of Syria! Don't attack Syria - an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the U.S. Focus on making our country strong and great again!
Many Syrian 'rebels' are radical Jihadis. Not our friends and supporting them doesn't serve our national interest. Stay out of Syria!
Don't attack Syria - an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the U.S. Focus on making our country strong and great again!
Trump's non-interventionist rhetoric regarding Syria and unwillingness to declare Putin an evil enemy of America during the campaign resulted in an all-out assault by the Deep State to derail his candidacy, falsely claiming he was a puppet of Russia.
These unsubstantiated claims and vitriolic propaganda campaign against Trump to elect Deep State candidate of choice - crooked Hillary - led to a heroic effort by the alternate media across the internet countering the mainstream media propaganda with facts and reason. When the corporate media shills rolled out the "fake news" storyline to discredit the alternate truth telling media, it immediately blew up in their faces, as the majority of the public began to realize the fake news was being plied by CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and the rest of the captured corporate legacy media.
The discontent with the status quo among the normal people in flyover America was so great, it overcame all the Deep State propaganda, fake news, vast sums of money behind Clinton, and liberal urban strongholds, to elect Donald Trump as an agent of change who would kick the bums out of Washington.
The undermining of Trump's presidency began before he took office as the propaganda machine kicked into overdrive, with non-stop media squawking about Russia hacking the U.S. election in favor of Trump. There were no facts, no evidence, no substance, but plenty of innuendo, plenty of unfounded accusations, and fake news reports at a fanatical level by faux journalists being paid millions to do their part.
Putin as 'an evil manipulator, controlling Trump,' was the meme flogged 24 hours a day by the Deep State to keep Trump on the defensive. The only question at this point is whether Trump has already been co-opted by the Deep State military industrial complex or whether he is being manipulated through false flags and traditional propaganda techniques.
Based on the slow progress on his domestic agenda of immigration reform, Obamacare repeal, tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and trade reform, it appears Trump decided to take the advice of neo-cons within and outside his administration and distract the masses with some new military adventurism. The relentless pounding of the Russian hacking narrative put Trump on the defensive. As Syria and Russia were on the verge of crushing the ISIS/Al Qaeda/"moderate rebel" resistance, a new false flag was needed.
As McArthur so accurately described seven decades ago, the incessant propaganda of fear is what enriches the military industrial complex.
"Our country is now geared
to an arms economy
which was bred in an artificially induced
psychosis of war hysteria
and nurtured upon an incessant propaganda
of fear."
General Douglas McArthur
In Part Three (below) of this article I will discuss how Trump has been co-opted by the Deep State into doing their bidding with military intervention and bullying across the globe.
It's just a continuation of imperialism run rampant.
Empires always decline and fall due to military overreach and economic bankruptcy. The American empire will be no different...
Part 3
May 07, 2017
In Part One and Part Two of this article I detailed the decades of propaganda, false flags, and misinformation campaigns used by the Deep State to gain power and control over the U.S. government. When war or a financial crisis is necessary to keep the profits flowing, events will be steered to such an outcome. With the latest financial plundering operation running out of steam, the Deep State is pushing the world toward global conflict.

If at first you don't succeed with a false flag gas attack, try try again.
Knowing a vast swath of the American populace is incapable of critical thinking or able to discern between fake news and factual events, the Deep State and their media lackeys unquestioningly promoted the story of children being killed by a sarin gas attack by Assad.
The photos of rescue workers helping victims without gloves immediately invalidated the narrative, as the rescue workers would be dead if they handled sarin gas victims without protective gear. The faux journalists, pretending to be neutral observers, did not question this blatant lie.
They did not ponder why Assad would commit such an idiotic atrocity when he was clearly in control of the battlefield and on the verge of defeating his American funded rebel enemies.
The Deep State masters of manipulation had been flogging the Russiagate story to such a degree, a large portion of the population actually believed Putin hacked the election and got Trump elected.
Despite not one iota of proof or evidence, they had successfully used their propaganda mainstream media machine to keep Trump on the ropes. Putin's unwavering support for Assad and success in defeating the ISIS/Al Qaeda/American rebel forces made the Deep State even more desperate. With Trump's domestic agenda stalled, this false flag gas attack offered him the opportunity to look tough and distance himself from Russia.
He took the bait and launched the 59 missiles into Syria, doing virtually no damage to anything vital to Syria's war effort. They were launching planes to attack rebels from that base the next day. The invisible government players achieved victory once again, as it only took three months to turn the non-interventionist candidate into the next war loving president.
The overwhelming cheers from liberal and conservative media outlets were deafening.
McCain, Graham, Schumer, Pelosi and all the usual neo-con suspects were ecstatic. Trump's poll ratings jumped. The majority of the non-thinking public applauded the tough guy act. It went so well, Trump was convinced by his trigger happy military leadership to use the Mother of All Bombs on some underground tunnels in the middle of bumfuk Afghanistan.
It was all captured on film so it could be played over and over on,
CNN Fox MSNBC,
CNN
Fox
MSNBC,
...and the rest of Deep State network TV.
The corporate media dutifully provided casualty counts even though they had no way of verifying anything they reported.
This was essentially a propaganda film to pump up the spirits of the heavily indebted, iGadget addicted, clueless masses.

Trump is seeing how easy it is to wage war around the globe, make threatening gestures, order his fleets into attack position, place a $1 billion missile defense system in another country at our cost, and generally act as if he is playing a giant game of Risk, like he did as a rich kid.
Everything looks like a nail when all you have is a hammer. It's much easier being a foreign interventionist and pleasing the Deep State, than draining the swamp and going to war against the status quo like he promised during the campaign. Filling your cabinet with status quo insiders is not a recipe for success.
His first two military parlays played so well, he decided it was time to teach the crazed midget lunatic in North Korea whose boss. Trump ordered carrier groups to sail towards North Korea. He's been test firing ICBM rockets as a warning.
He's been threatening China unless they do something to get the height challenged dictator under control. The propaganda machine has been trying to strike fear into the hearts of Americans with bullshit storylines about him nuking the U.S. Kim Jong Un is a certifiable nutjob. He's been running the third world country as dictator for the last five years. He's a blustering fool who constantly threatens, with no actions to back up the threats. Half his missile launches blow up shortly after launch.
If he ever has a nuke, he has no means of delivering it effectively. The drivel about him hitting the U.S. with a nuke is laughable, but the deceitful neo-cons act as if he could do it. The mainstream media unquestioningly reports the threat to the western U.S.
The Deep State would love to provoke a war with North Korea. They have no concern for the millions of South Koreans who would become the latest collateral damage of the imperialist American Empire.
War means profits. Maybe a clash with the Chinese over the South China Sea islands could be arranged. Placing missiles on the border of Russia and conducting NATO war games certainly isn't provocative.

"They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force - nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others."
The United States is not in danger of being attacked by North Korea, Syria, Iran or a bunch of cave dwellers in Afghanistan.
Russia and China are not threatening our vital interests. We spend more on the military than the next seven countries combined, but the narrative sold to the gullible public is how our military has been gutted and needs hundreds of billions more funding.
When the cost of past wars and the surveillance state expenditures are included, the U.S. spends in excess of $1 trillion per year. We have been an imperial power since World War II and have been intervening in other countries' affairs since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913.
Policing the world is expensive for the citizens, but enriching to those doing the policing and supplying the police.
Without a central bank printing press and man-made inflation, American presidents and their Deep State (The Deep State - The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government) backers couldn't oppress countries throughout the world with the threat of instantaneous annihilation or invade without a declaration of war - as mandated by the Constitution.

America's imperial empire may be more technologically advanced and larger than previous empires, but there is nothing special or new about imperialism.
The policy of wielding influence and power through the use of military and economic force by empires over smaller weaker countries has been played out through the centuries.
Whether it was the Roman, Dutch, Ottoman, or British empires, they all declined and fell due to military overreach, civic decay, and economic decline. When I step back and try to analyze our current situation I come to the conclusion our current policies and budget priorities are pure madness.
But I feel like the crazy uncle at the family reunion who is shunned and ignored when I bring up the blatantly obvious facts regarding our fiscal situation.
Congress just passed a spending bill extension which cuts nothing and increases military spending.
The House just passed an Obamacare replacement bill that won't cut your premiums or co-pays, and will keep insurance conglomerates, hospital corporations and corporate drug company cartels in charge of your healthcare. It is business as usual in the imperialistic capital of Washington DC, and the madness will continue until the teetering empire collapses under the massive weight of debt and overreach.
Trump is no Tea Party Republican.
He's a big spending, big tax cut, big military, pretend fiscal conservative without the guts to touch entitlement spending or war expenditures - the two budget areas driving the country towards bankruptcy.
"As many frustrated Americans who have joined the Tea Party realize, we cannot stand against big government at home while supporting it abroad. We cannot talk about fiscal responsibility while spending trillions on occupying and bullying the rest of the world. We cannot talk about the budget deficit and spiraling domestic spending without looking at the costs of maintaining an American empire of more than 700 military bases in more than 120 foreign countries. We cannot pat ourselves on the back for cutting a few thousand dollars from a nature preserve or an inner-city swimming pool at home while turning a blind eye to a Pentagon budget that nearly equals those of the rest of the world combined." Ron Paul

Trump's recent conversion into a warmongering neo-con, policing the world with his cruise missiles, MOABs, carrier fleets, and boots on the ground remind me of Apocalypse Now, one of my favorite movies about imperialism and madness.
Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant movie was a modern day updating of Joseph Conrad's classic novel Heart of Darkness. Both the movie and the novel address the evil nature of imperialism, the brutality inflicted on innocent people in the name of spreading democracy, and ultimately driving good men to madness as they attempt to rationalize their allegiance to an imperialist empire bent on profit through the committing atrocities in the name of progress.
Rational moral men cannot carry out the orders of sociopathic politicians and generals without ultimately losing their minds. King Leopold II of Belgium formed "The Company" to strip the Congo of its natural resources while enslaving and killing millions from 1880 until 1900. The leaders of imperialist nations practice hypocrisy on a grand scale.
While they justify their imperialism with rhetoric about democracy, fighting evil, and doing God's work, reality is the opposite of the propaganda peddled by the imperialist emperors of evil. The Kurtz character in the novel and the movie is a brilliant man, selected by his imperial masters for great things and a future at the top of the "Company" food chain.
While the men running the show at the top describe their invasion and subjugation of foreign peoples as a benevolent project of civilization, people like Kurtz, who are tasked with the dirty work of suppression and extermination through the use of violence and intimidation, are driven mad in the process. The young men who do the fighting and killing on the front lines of this so called War on Terror must eventually come to realize they are waging war on behalf of evil men who have lied to them and the American public.
Assenting to obvious mistruths and propaganda is essentially co-operating with and enabling evil.
When citizens fail to hold their leaders accountable for blatant lies, false narratives, and despicable propaganda storylines, they become evil themselves. They lie to themselves in order to go along with the crowd and appear normal.
By remaining silent as the State operates without constraints, a humiliated populace loses its will to resist evil deeds done in their name. A society of impotent, passive, normalcy bias racked people is easy to control and manipulate.
Appearing normal in a world gone made is not a sign of true normalcy, but a sign of madness and abnormalcy...
"The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted." Aldous Huxley Brave New World Revisited

Brave New World Revisited
If Huxley considered American society to be inhabited by millions of abnormally normal people in the 1950's, I can only imagine what he would think of our deviant, irrational, utterly mad civilization today.
In this profoundly abnormal society my views are considered absurd and the ravings of a chicken little.
How could I question $1 trillion annual budget deficits? How could I point out the unsustainability of a system with $20 trillion of debt and $200 trillion of unfunded entitlement liabilities? How could I be outraged by a private bank controlling our currency, debasing its purchasing power by 96% over 104 years, and working on behalf of Wall Street rather than Main Street? How could I question spending $1 trillion per year on military adventurism and policing the world when we are already $20 trillion in debt? Is it too much to ask if we send men to die for a cause, that the cause not be false?

How could I not trust my government to run our healthcare system after seeing how well they run the Veterans Administration, Medicare and Social Security? Why would I not believe politicians of both parties who have lied to me for decades and are completely in the pockets of wealthy special interests? Why shouldn't I support mega-corporations who have shipped millions of American jobs to foreign slave labor camps, while utilizing lobbyists to game our purposely complex tax system?

It's crazy talk for me to point out how Wall Street bankers committed the largest control fraud in world history and were rewarded with a $700 billion taxpayer bailout, free money from the Fed, larger market shares, record bonuses, no prosecutions, and now control of the White House from the inside.
How could I possibly support "traitors" like Snowden and Assange for revealing the contempt for the Constitution displayed by our government keepers as they illegally conduct surveillance operations against every citizen in the nation? Am I mad for asking these questions?

Kurtz symbolizes the imperialism of empires enforced through the ruthless application of power, craven terror, economic retribution, armed intimidation and military attack.
As the empire grows in power, degenerates morally, becomes more corrupt, and develops an overwhelming level of arrogance and hubris, decline and fall are inevitable. Madness and imperialism go hand in hand. Absolute power with no fear of reprisal from citizens or a free press, combined with man's fundamental fallibility, lead to uncontrolled dangerous decision making.
We are witnessing the perilous effects of imperial hubris as Trump and his arrogant advisors provoke conflict in multiple hotspots across the globe with nuclear armed nations. Imperialists are always sure their malevolent machinations will end in victory.
They never consider the potential unintended consequences of their actions, like global war, nuclear annihilation, millions of casualties, or the fall of their empire. The same arrogance displayed by central bankers, government apparatchiks, crooked politicians, and Wall Street shysters as the 2008 financial catastrophe approached is being displayed today by Trump, his surveillance state cronies, and the neo-cons now running the show in the White House.
They believe their "brilliant" strategy, tactics, and propaganda campaign will surely result in success, as their opponents/victims are weaker and not as skilled in diplomatic manipulation and military aptitude. The Deep State players, who now seem to have gained control over Trump, have no sense of morality, no shame in their blatant hypocrisy, no hesitation in sending men to their deaths based on a fabricated cause, no compunction in lying to the American public, and no guilt while shredding the U.S. Constitution.
The object of power is power to these traitorous men.
Many Americans viewed the presidential election as a choice between,
the lesser of two evils the least bad choice
the lesser of two evils
the least bad choice
As Trump has broken promises,
filled his cabinet with Goldman Sachs cronies failed to drain the swamp proven ineffective in legislating,
filled his cabinet with Goldman Sachs cronies
failed to drain the swamp
proven ineffective in legislating,
...and has now been captured by the neo-con warmongers, the best argument for his presidency has been,
"at least he's not Clinton"...
That is true.
The Supreme Court won't go further left, taxes won't go up, the EPA won't regulate industries out of existence, illegal immigration will be reduced and ridiculous social justice bullshit won't be pushed down our throats by the Feds. But let's face the facts. This is nothing but tinkering around the edges of a bloated government bureaucracy, controlled by powerful men in smoke filled rooms, who have absolutely no interest in changing anything that would impact their financial interests in a negative way.
They are doing everything in their power to keep the status quo in place. The American Empire has been waging war virtually non-stop since the creation of The Creature of Jekyll Island (aka Federal Reserve) in 1913.
After World War II, as the size of the empire grew to heights never seen in world history, the level of hypocrisy, propaganda, maliciousness, immorality, and hubris has grown exponentially.
The madness of the men running this colonial empire is concealed through the moral ambiguity and faux patriotism utilized to confuse and mislead a willfully ignorant populace who long ago relinquished their citizenship responsibilities to men they have never seen and never voted for.
How can we judge the actions of these men to be evil when all societal moral standards and social values have been abandoned? Is there such thing as insanity in a world that has already gone insane?

The American Empire is slithering along the edge of a straight razor.
Only real judgment enforced by alarmed critical thinking armed citizens can defeat the Deep State at this point...
