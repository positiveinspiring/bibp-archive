Astronauts in orbit view the earth, its atmosphere and the
astronomical sky from altitudes ranging from 100 to 800 + nautical
miles (160 to 1300 km.) above mean sea level, well above many of the
restrictions of the ground-based observer. They are skilled in
accurate observations, their eyesight is excellent, they have an
intimate familiarity with navigational astronomy and a broad
understanding of the basic physical sciences. Their reports from
orbit of visual sightings therefore deserve careful consideration.
Between 12 April 1961 and 15 November 1966, 30 astronauts spent a
total of 2503 hours in orbit. (see Tables 1 and 2 ) During the
flights the astronauts carried out assigned tasks of several general
categories, viz: defense, engineering, medical, and scientific. A
list of the assigned tasks that were part of the Mercury program is
provided in Table 3 to give an idea of the kinds of visual
observations the astronauts were asked to make.
As a part of the program, debriefings were held following each U.S.
mission. At these sessions, the astronauts were questioned by
scientists involved in the design of the experiments about their
observations, unplanned as well as specifically assigned. The
debriefings complemented on-the-spot reports made by the astronauts
during the mission in radio contacts with the ground-control center.
In this way, a comprehensive summary was obtained of what the
astronauts had seen while in orbit.
This chapter discusses the conditions under which the astronauts
observed, with particular reference to the Mercury and Gemini series,
and the observations, both planned and unplanned made by them. The

GT-10 and GT-11 by powered departures from the "stable"
orbits indicated by the perigee and apogee given in the table.
