Now Wiki-Leaks is busy selling phony bin Laden
stories, having the long dead Osama humiliating the CIA by running around
villages in Afghanistan selling vacuum cleaners.
What is our leak site really about? This is a
dead news cycle.
The World Cup is over, lots of people on holiday
and no major stories. Only in a dead news period like this, as Oliver Stone
pointed out, could the Israeli controlled media dump a pile of lame rumors
mixed in with box loads of chickenfeed, passing it off as the story of the
century.
Even the cover story, the mysterious
Assange fleeing the murderous CIA,
working to save the world is lame. WikiLeaks is lame.
Please, everyone, go to the site and read
everything there. I have seen more confidential information on a weather
report. Assange is hardly a James Bond figure. Woody Allen is masculine in
comparison.
Journalists all get leaks, and frankly, we dont print most of them. Some we
cant trust. Some are just too dangerous. Some are simply illegal. Some are
blatantly self serving Israeli propaganda coated with a veneer of
anti-Americanism. This is Wiki-leaks material. What is important is
what they dont print.
The only things that come out about Israel, the
country most vulnerable to leaks, the country always up to the most
skulduggery, is an occasional harmless story like their major leak on East
Jerusalem settlements. It hit the New York Times first.
When you read Mr. Assanges output, you are looking at one of the Mossad
games, nothing more. They send some stories to Fox News, some to CNN,
some to the Washington Post or London Times.
They have their pick as their friends and
co-workers own those outlets and so many more.
The game today is using Wikileaks, given its 15
minutes of fame for trashing the US in Iraq with the helicopter video, to
spread imaginary stories about Pakistan, the only nuclear power in the
Middle East capable of standing up to Israel and the enemy of India.
India is what it is all really about. Israel is playing India for a fall,
drawing them into their games they way they did with the United States in
Iraq and Afghanistan. India will wake up with their government bought off,
blackmailed, up to their neck in wars and insurgencies at home and fighting
Israels enemies abroad.
India is the next real target for rape,
destruction, destabilization by Israel and our Wiki-leak is part of that
game.
Another chosen victim, of course, is the United States, hated enemy of
Israel, not for public consumption, however. Check the names of
those who looted the American economy.
In the top dresser drawer of 80% of those who
took the US into bankruptcy, you will find an Israeli passport.

Did anyone ask why nothing was reported
in 90,000 pages regarding the massive drug dealing in Afghanistan?
-
With stories in the press around the
world reporting that President Karzai and his brother are the
biggest druglords in the world, why would this not be mentioned?
-
Is it because Karzai is a good friend of
the Indo-Israeli alliance that runs Wiki-leaks?
Classified Army documents are filled to the brim
with reports that
the CIA and their private contractors are
involved in drug operations with Karzai but also other names are named
including many prominent Americans, some members of congress.
I wont leak their names but I know they are in
the documents. If Wiki got what they say they got, then most of their
documents would have reported corruption, drug dealing, governments of a
dozen countries would have been mentioned.
If real leaks were made public and we did something about it, first by
arresting the gangsters and spies filling congress, the White House and
every federal agency, we might balance our budget but who would be left to
do the Sunday morning talk shows? If you want the names of those who would
really be on leaked documents, check your TV listings. It isnt a
coincidence.
Those chosen to lie on television are also being
paid for other duties as well. Israel would have been cited for laundering
drug money for the Taliban. It is in the documents.
I didnt release them. That is illegal.
BG Asif Haroon Raja of Pakistan, former Attaché to Egypt and
respected intelligence analyst had the following to say about the Wiki
barrage:
Unsubstantiated and fabricated allegations
against Pakistan and its premier institutions are so absurd and decayed
that it gives nausea to the reader.
Only ones who enjoy the stale jokes are its
manufacturers or the game players. ISI-Taliban closeness has been
drummed up in such a manner as if it is the biggest sin ever committed.
Each time it is presented with a new flavor
to make it look more breathtaking. This unholy practice has been going
on systematically and incessantly for the last six years to condition
the minds of the world audience and to convert falsehood into truth.
Story of this nature is routinely published in western media every
fortnightly.
In the last few months write ups on this subject have suddenly gained
impetus. Previously, accusations were in the form of allegations made by
newspapers and think tanks.
Now top US civil and military officials have
jumped into the arena with loins girded up and have started using high
handed tactics openly without caring for diplomatic decorum. Propaganda
assault together with verbal assaults by visiting officials and drone
attacks have become a norm. They have become xenophobic and overbearing.
This can be gauged from the mood of the
three US visitors who visited Islamabad recently.
Prickly Hillary Clinton can see ghost of Osama sauntering in
Pakistan each time she lands in Pakistan. Through her lens she sees ISI
in cahoots with Taliban. She again reminded our harried rulers that any
attack on US homeland with connection to Pakistan would have devastating
consequences upon Pak-US relations.
She conceitedly dangled few carrots to make
them do more. Grim looking Holbrooke and tense ridden Adm.
Mike Mullen harbored similar ideas.
The trio wanted Pak Army to cut off its
entire links with Taliban, consider Indians as friends and to promptly
launch an operation in North Waziristan to chase out Haqqani network and
Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the two outfits
most dreaded by USA . LeT has been put on the hit list to please India .
Wikileaks is a follow up of London Report and some of the objectives
behind it are to keep Pakistan pressured and cornered, authenticate
Indian allegations about ISIs involvement in various acts of terror in
Afghanistan, demonize LeT and defame ISI, exert pressure on
Obama Administration to
affect a change in its policy of softness towards Pakistan,
reconciliation with Taliban and withdrawal of coalition forces.
India together with Northern Alliance and
pro-war American senior officials are possibly behind the Wikileaks
scandal. This report is less harmful for Pakistan and more injurious for
USA since source reports on Pakistan mostly provided by RAAM and RAW
agents were never taken seriously by the receivers.
Receiving officers have been noting their
remarks on such reports as lacking in authenticity, biased and devoid of
credibility. Moreover, such manipulated leakages would further widen
rather than build trust gap between USA and Pakistan .
When Joe Biden and General Petraeus
both reported that Israel was endangering American troops, the classified
portion of this involved Israeli operations in Afghanistan, which are
extensive.
They are all over Washington, anyone could pick
them up. They just dont.
Ask Oliver Stone why...
Hundreds of pages of reports of Israeli and Indian operatives in Pakistans
region called Baluchistan were tossed out also. Their involvement in
terrorism, not only against Iran but working directly with the Taliban in
Pakistan was there but not included. So much wasnt included.
Nothing involving drug flights being serviced by Israeli companies was
released. It was in the files. If we really want to leak things, they are
out there. It can get bloody.
Wikileaks leaves a trail of stench from Mr. Assange right to Tel Aviv.
If anyone couldnt see it,
the corporate press
or the Israeli press or the Zionist press or whatever the
current buzz word is for the useless press, they put you on the path.
They are the ones putting a spotlight on the disinformation and failing
miserably to note how obviously the leaks have been edited to serve Israeli
games.
Wikileaks is Israel. Assange works for them, I hope not unwittingly. I hate
it when people are duped. I would rather he were paid or being blackmailed.
I always want the useless to be rewarded in this life because, just in case
their is another one after this, they know what they can expect there.
It wont be pleasant.
I didnt want to write this, add to the problem. Even negative publicity is
publicity. Every time I am attacked, my readership goes up dramatically. It
almost encourages one to be abrasive and unnecessarily controversial, like
with Fox News.
Lets cut this short.
Wikileaks is simply another ploy by the
ultra powerful Israel lobby, a cheap game meant to humiliate the United
States, destroy Pakistan and build a reputation for a puppet.
I suspect it will fail.
I hope this effort is useful in that endeavor.
