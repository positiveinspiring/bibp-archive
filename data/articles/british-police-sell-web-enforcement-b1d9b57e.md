British police illegally hijack websites worldwide and replace them with
e-commerce shops at the request of large corporate sponsors.
The Internet is free: a statement that five years ago would have been taken
as true. It is true in the sense that anybody can place information upon it
and anybody can access that information, freely without restriction.
This is important as the advancements in
technology help keep the people level with large corporations and
governments, because after all knowledge is power.
Recently however, more and more attempts have
been made by governments working on behalf of large corporations to censor
and limit who is able to provide information and content available on the
Internet.
There are numerous examples of this censorship,
e.g. the obvious
SOPA bill that was unsuccessfully pushed
through the legal system of the USA, the legal issues regarding the
well-known website "The
Pirate Bay" (TPB) in Sweden, which one may add hosts no illegal
content but merely acts as a search engine in much the same way as
Google, and finally the well-known censorship of the TPB website in the
United Kingdom.
Whilst any censorship of information is inherently bad and wrong at least,
the examples above have passed through court, and whilst it has been shown
that money can buy a victory or ruling in court (TPB in Sweden and the UK),
giving them the legal high ground, that cannot be said for the recent
activities of the new British Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit
(PIPCU).
The PIPCU is a section of the City of London
Police that works as an enforcement arm for various private organizations
such as,
The way they operate, and arguably their
existence, is both worrying and should set off warning bells in any Internet
users head.
"Intelligence" is gathered by private
investigators that work for organizations such as the BPI and FACT and
forwarded to the PIPCU.
The PIPCU then directly contact the DNS
registrar of the website in question and request that the website be
redirected to a website of the private investigators choice. With neither
evidence nor legal authority provided, the PIPCU threaten the DNS registrar
so that they will be reported to ICANN, the international body that grants
the ability to DNS registrars to register domain names.
They quote a section of
ICANNs registrar accreditation agreement
which states that the registrar must respond to legal requests, and call the
owner of the website in question a "criminal".
Both of these are wrong. The letter or "request"
sent by the PIPCU is not a legal request. It has no legal weight, as it has
not passed through a court, nor are the website owners criminals as they
have not been deemed of committing a crime by a court of law.
The PIPCU are also working with "financial
institutions" presumably on the same premise to freeze the funds of
website owners who are posting information certain corporations deem
unwanted.
"Before
anybody tells me 'this is just some bittorrent domain, just take it
down', remember what we said back in 2010: First They Came For the File
Sharing Domains."
Whatever Happened to "Due Process"
?
It is very hard to defend the actions of PIPCU,
mainly due to them ignoring the court system.
If they were legitimately shutting down illegal
websites then that has to be a good thing. The point, however, has to be
that this is not what they are doing. It is not their job nor in their
jurisdiction to decide whether or not a website is illegal; it is in fact
the courts.
The job of the police is to uphold the laws set
out by the court and to provide evidence and information in order for courts
to make discussions.
People are not guilty of a crime when they are
arrested or charged. They are guilty of a crime once a court has found them
guilty. Only then can the punishment or sentence be given.
To look at this another way, what would be the
reaction of the public to a police officer arresting someone on the street,
finding them guilty on the spot of a crime and sentencing them to prison.
One can only presume not a good one.
The PIPCU are simply using their assumed
authority to bully and threaten companies into taking action requested by
other companies. This is corporate corruption of a police force with massive
implications that could lead to terrible outcomes.
Regardless of the legality of the websites taken
down, the actions and methods used by the PIPCU are what should the focus in
a situation such as this.
Bypassing checks and balances, such as the court
system, that were put in place for a reason should be questioned and we are
the only people who can question issues such as this.
