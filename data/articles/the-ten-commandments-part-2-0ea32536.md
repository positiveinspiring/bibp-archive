Getting History Straight.....
The Ten Commandments
(More on the Bible and Jesus)
This Awareness indicates that the
entity Jesus presented an entirely different presentation of divinity, -- showing
love, humility, kindness and that of as comforter and healer, not one who
went forth slaying enemies or cursing those who were not obedient, but giving
service to others, to the needy, to the weak and the poor. This Awareness
indicates that these deities, Jehovah and Jesus, personified the level of
consciousness at that time.
Jehovah represented essentially the concepts of
the Arian Age, the Age of Aries, a warlike time, a god of war, vengeance and
power.
Whereas the entity Jesus represented the
Piscian Age, a fisher of man,
one who personified and emotion of love and walked upon the water of Pisces,
the deity which was slain as a lamb, representing the end of the Age of Aries, -- the
ram, and expressing the movement into the Age of Pisces, -- the fish.
This Awareness indicates that these
deities as personified in the ancient texts were not simply historically presented,
but were also symbolic of the time and the Age, and these writings of these
books were deliberately presented from secret schools whose astrologers and
priests knew precisely what they were conveying according to the level of
consciousness which would be experiencing, studying or developing during the
Age. This Awareness indicates that entities would profit much by understanding
the qualities of the signs of the zodiac and comparing these to the gods of
the historical era of the different ages.
This Awareness indicates there are
so many different levels of meaning in the Bible: the Old Testament representing
both historical, allegorical, symbolic and secret teachings, as will be seen
in the Scorpio Correspondence Lessons on magic. These old and New Testaments
cannot be taken from a narrow viewpoint, literally accepted without further
understanding, unless the entities do not care to discover the true and comprehensive
value of this book of books.
This Awareness indicates that many
entities prefer to have the simple, literal translation and ignore all of
the deeper meanings, and this is their right to do so; but it is not their
right to condemn others who wish to look deeper and find more meaningful messages
which are also placed within these scriptures by the ancient priests and writers
of the Bible.
This Awareness indicates that in reading the
Old Testament following the Ten Commandments, entities will notice several
conflicting expressions or commands, whereby the Lord, in one breath, commands
that entities do this, and in another verse, commands that just the opposite
behavior is appropriate. This Awareness indicates this inconsistency in the
application of the law made Jehovah, one who could make laws and break laws,
to be seen as an all-powerful God who was not even bound by his own word,
by his own law. The God who says 'Thou shalt not kill', yet Himself slays
the enemies of his people or demands a blood sacrifice of the first born, -- this
Awareness indicates this as an action which was seen by these followers as
a God of vengeance, power, and one who was above his own law; therefore to
be feared.
