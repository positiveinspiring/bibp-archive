Author Daniel Estulin
at the European parliament
The goal of the Bilderbergers, the powerful
elite invited annually to a private and protected meeting from which world
events are steered, is power, plain and simple, according to an author who
spoke on the subject today before the European Parliament.
But Daniel Estulin, author of the hot-selling book "The
True Story of the Bilderberg Group," said in the text of his
remarks he believes the very efforts by the power-hungry to manipulate the
world economy is awakening the masses, who now have an opportunity to change
history and give mankind back its future.
Estulin was invited to speak to the European Parliament, considered one of
the most powerful legislative bodies in the world, by Mario Borghezio,
Italy's most senior member, about what many have considered a "conspiracy"
or "secretive cabal."
He said the members simply want to control.
Read about those who would plan your future for you, in "The True Story of
the Bilderberg Group" by Daniel Estulin.
"These people want an empire," he said.
"That's what
globalization is
Too many people
believe that in order to have an empire, you need money. You have all
heard of the phrase - the money[ed] elite. But money is not a
determinant of wealth and the economy. Money does not make the world go
around."
He explained it is the power that derives from
money and the ability to make decisions affecting other people that is
central.
"The idea behind each and every Bilderberg
meeting is to create what they themselves call the aristocracy of
purpose between European and North American elites on the best way
to manage the planet.
In other words, the creation of
a global network of giant cartels, more
powerful than any nation on Earth, destined to control the necessities
of life of the rest of humanity, obviously from their vantage point, for
our own good and in our benefit - the great unwashed as they call
us," he said.
Sometimes, he said, this power comes through the
destruction of economies.
"They are destroying the world economy on
purpose," he explained. "This isn't the first time either. This was done
in the 14th century New Dark Age: 30 percent of the
population wiped out."
But there is a light, he asserted.
"We are now in a position to change history.
I finally believe that mankind has a future. A once-demoralized
population with no moral purpose is coming out of [a] prolonged slumber.
In this general awakening, people are beginning to ask the right
questions," he said.
"It's no longer, 'What will I get out of it?' but rather 'What's right?'
It's an international phenomenon of response and reaction to a
perception that the entire world is doomed to catastrophe unless we the
people do something about it."
He said the concept of the Bilderbergs is easy
to understand.
"In the world of international finance,
there are those who steer the events and those who react to the events.
While the latter are better known, greater in numbers, and seemingly
more powerful, the true power rests with the former," he said.
He explained the Bilderberg organization is
dynamic,
"in that it changes with the times, absorbs
and creates new parts while excreting the remains of the decaying parts.
Members come and go, but the system itself has not changed."
"It is a self-perpetuating system, a virtual spider web of interlocked
financial, political, economic and industry interests," he said.
Actually, it's not much of a secret any longer
and not much conspiracy, said Estulin.
"It's a meeting of people who represent a
certain ideology," he said. "The ideology is of a one world company
limited.
"Bilderberg is a medium of bringing together financial institutions
which are the world's most powerful and most predatory financial
interests. And at this time, it is that combination which is the worst
enemy of humanity," he said.
He said the citizens of the world have forced
the higher level of awareness about the plots and plans,
"by becoming very aware that presidents and
prime ministers and your little shrinking queens and kings are puppets
of powerful forces working from behind the scenes."
He said that's where the door to success may
open.
"Something has happened to us, the people in
the midst of this general economic collapse. People at large are gripped
by something they don't always understand. But, it compels them to act
in a certain way, in their own interest. That's what they are doing in
Greece. That's what they are doing in Spain, in the United States.
It's called the anthropic principle. It's
like a tidal movement came upon us and washed our fears away. As people
realize that their existence is threatened, they have lost their fear,
and Bilderberg and others sense it," he said.
"Perhaps that's why at a recent
Council on Foreign Relations speech in Montreal,
Zbigniew Brzezinski
warned that a 'global
political awakening,' in combination with infighting amongst
the elite, was threatening to derail the move towards a one world
government," he said.
"What I am talking about is not a scientific problem or economic
question, but rather a morality question. A question of immortality. Do
we as nation states, as people of the planet believe in the future of
mankind? And what kind of future will we have 100 or 200 years in the
future. What about 10,000 years from now? Do we have a right to dream?
If we have a sense of purpose for being
here, then the bad guys can't win," he said.
The Bilderberg Group is an annual,
invitation-only conference usually with more than 100 of the globe's most
influential leaders, including heads of state and business tycoons. It
always is closed to the public and press, a privacy frequently ensured by
armed agents.
WND reported attendance at last year's event included:
-
U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner
-
Larry Summers, the director of the U.S.
National Economic Council
-
Richard Holbrooke, the Obama
administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan
-
World Bank President Robert Zoellick
-
European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet
-
European Commission president Jose
Manuel Barroso
"Bilderberg is not a bogeyman," Estulin told
WND before his parliamentary address, "but it is a powerful
organization. It's a medium for bringing together financial institutions
- the largest, predatory institutions in the world - which acts
in ways that are now the worst enemy of society."
He said the elite consider the national
resources their own, not "everyone's."
"They want us to work for them, where our
children and our children's children work for an elite group, the
oligarchy," he said.
He has cited
David Rockefeller's own admission.
Rockefeller, a Bilderberg member, wrote:
"Some even believe we are part of a secret
cabal working against the best interests of the United States,
characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring
with others around the world to build a more integrated global political
and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I
stand guilty, and I am proud of it."
Estulin's book, "The True Story of the
Bilderberg Group," is based on years of his work as a Madrid-based
journalist and investigative reporter. He connected the dots between the
Bilderberg Group, world events, politicians and corporate tycoons over a
period of 15 years.
Estulin revealed how the web of people and organizations has become a,
"shadow government whose top priority is to
erase the sovereignty of all nation-states and supplant them with global
corporate control of their economies under the surveillance of 'an
electronic global police state.'"
He says not all members of the group are "bad,"
explaining that membership is structured like concentric circles, with
varying responsibilities and relationships. But it includes almost every
famous player in politics and finance, such as
George W. Bush,
George Soros, George McGovern and Jimmy
Carter.
Estulin writes:
"This parallel world remains unseen in the
daily struggles of most of humanity, but, believe me, it is there: a
cesspool of duplicity and lies and double-speak and innuendo and
blackmail and bribery.
It is a surreal world of double and triple
agents, of changing loyalties, of professional psychotic assassins,
brainwashed black ops agents, soldiers of fortune and mercenaries, whose
primary sources of income are the dirtiest and most despicable
government-run subversive missions - the kind that can never be
exposed."
The conference this year is scheduled June 3-6
in Sitges, Spain.
Former British cabinet minister Lord Denis Healey, one of the
founders of the group, explained the purpose of the group to Jon Ronson
of the Guardian.
"Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't
go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and
rendering millions homeless," he said. "So we felt that a single
community throughout the world would be a good thing."
