WHAT CREATURE IS THIS?
What is the Federal Reserve
System?
The answer may surprise you. It
is not federal and there are no reserves. Furthermore, the
Federal Reserve Banks are not even banks.
The key to this riddle is to be
found, not at the beginning of the story, but in the middle.
Since this is not a textbook, we are not confined to a
chronological structure. The subject matter is not a
curriculum to be mastered but a mystery to be solved.
So let us start where the action
is.

THE JOURNEY TO JEKYLL ISLAND
The secret meeting on Jekyll Island in Georgia at which the Federal Reserve
was conceived; the birth of a banking cartel to -protect its members from
competition; the strategy of haw to convince Congress and the public that
this cartel was an agency of the United States government
The New Jersey railway station was bitterly cold that night. Flurries of the
year's first snow swirled around street lights. November wind rattled roof
panels above the track shed and gave a long, mournful sound among the
rafters.
It was approaching ten P.M., and the station was nearly empty except for a
few passengers scurrying to board the last Southbound of the day. The rail
equipment was typical for that year of 1910, mostly chair cars that
converted into sleepers with cramped upper and lower berths. For those with
limited funds, coach cars were coupled to the front.
They would take the brunt of the engine's noise
and smoke that, somehow, always managed to seep through unseen cracks. A
dining car was placed between the sections as a subtle barrier between the
two classes of travelers. By today's Standards, the environment was drab.
Chairs and mattresses were hard. Surfaces were metal or scarred wood. Colors
were dark green and gray.
In their hurry to board the train and escape the chill of the wind, few
passengers noticed the activity at the far end of the platform. At a gate
seldom used at this hour of the night was a Spectacular sight. Nudged
against the end-rail bumper was a long car that caused those few who saw it
to stop and stare. Its gleaming black paint was accented with polished brass
hand rails, knobs, frames, and filigrees.
The shades were drawn, but through the open
door, one could see mahogany paneling, velvet drapes, plush armchairs, and a
well stocked bar.
Porters with white serving coats were busying
themselves with routine chores. And there was the distinct aroma of
expensive cigars. Other cars in the station bore numbers on each end to
distinguish them from their dull brothers. But numbers were not needed for
this beauty. On the center of each side was a small plaque bearing but a
single word: ALDRICH.
The name of Nelson Aldrich, senator from Rhode Island, was well known even
in New Jersey. By 1910, he was one of the most powerful men in Washington,
D.C., and his private railway car often was seen at the New York and New
Jersey rail terminals during frequent trips to Wall Street. Aldrich was far
more than a senator. He was considered to be the political spokesman for big
business.
As an investment associate of J.P. Morgan,
he had extensive holdings in banking, manufacturing, and public utilities.
His son-in-law was
John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Sixty years
later, his grandson, Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, would become Vice-President
of the United States.
When Aldrich arrived at the station, there was no doubt he was the commander
of the private car. Wearing a long, fur-collared coat, a silk top hat, and
carrying a silver-tipped walking stick, he strode briskly down the platform
with his private secretary, Shelton, and a cluster of porters behind them
hauling assorted trunks and cases.
No sooner had the Senator boarded his car when several more passengers
arrived with similar collections of luggage. The last man appeared just
moments before the final "aaall aboarrrd." He was carrying a shotgun case.
While Aldrich was easily recognized by most of the travelers who saw him
stride through the station, the other faces were not familiar. These
strangers had been instructed to arrive separately, to avoid reporters, and,
should they meet inside the station, to pretend they did not know each
other. After boarding the train, they had been told to use first names only
so as not to reveal each other's identity. As a result of these precautions,
not even the private-car porters and servants knew the names of these
guests.
Back at the main gate, there was a double blast from the engine's whistle.
Suddenly, the gentle sensation of motion; the excitement of a journey begun.
But, no sooner had the train cleared the platform when it shuttered to a
stop. Then, to everyone's surprise, it reversed direction and began moving
toward the station again.
Had they forgotten something? Was there a
problem with the engine?
A sudden lurch and the slam of couplers gave the answer. They had picked up
another car at the end of the train. Possibly the mail car? In an instant
the forward motion was resumed, and all thoughts returned to the hip ahead
and to the minimal comforts of the accommodations.
And so, as the passengers drifted off to sleep that night to the rhythmic
clicking of steel wheels against rail, little did they dream that, riding in
the car at the end of their train, were seven men who represented an
estimated one-fourth of the total wealth of the entire world.
This was the roster of the Aldrich car that night:
-
Nelson W. Aldrich, Republican "whip" in
the Senate, Chairman of the National Monetary Commission, business
associate of J.P. Morgan, father-in-law to John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
-
Abraham Piatt Andrew, Assistant
Secretary of the United States Treasury
-
Frank A. Vanderlip, president of the
National City Bank of New York, the most powerful of the banks at
that time, representing William Rockefeller and the international
investment banking house of Kuhn, Loeb & Company
-
Henry P. Davison, senior partner of the
J.P. Morgan Company
-
Charles D. Norton, president of J.P.
Morgan's First National Bank of New York
-
Benjamin Strong, head of J.P. Morgan's
Bankers Trust Company
-
Paul M. Warburg, a partner in Kuhn, Loeb
& Company, a representative of the Rothschild banking dynasty in
England and France, and brother to Max Warburg who was head of the
Warburg banking consortium in Germany and the Netherlands.
CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH
Centralization of control over financial resources was far advanced by 1910.
In the United States, there were two main focal
points of this control: the Morgan group and the Rockefeller group. Within
each orbit was a maze of commercial banks, acceptance banks, and investment
firms. In Europe, the same process had proceeded even further and had
coalesced into the Rothschild group and the Warburg group.
An article appeared in the New York Times on May
3, 1931, commenting on the death of George Baker, one of Morgan's
closest associates.
It said:
"One-sixth of the total wealth of the world
was represented by members of the Jekyll Island Club."
The reference was only to those in the Morgan
group, (members of the Jekyll Island Club), It did not include the
Rockefeller group or the European financiers. When all of these are
combined, the previous estimate that one-fourth of the world's wealth was
represented by these groups is probably conservative.
In 1913, the year that the Federal Reserve Act became law, a subcommittee of
the House Committee on Currency and Banking, under the chairmanship of
Arsene Pujo of Louisiana, completed its investigation into the
concentration of financial power in the United States. Pujo was considered
to be a spokesman for the oil interests, part of the very group under
investigation, and did everything possible to sabotage the hearings.
In spite of his efforts, however, the final
report of the committee at large was devastating:
Your committee is satisfied from the proofs
submitted... that there is an established and well defined identity and
community of interest between a few leaders of finance... which has
resulted in great and rapidly growing concentration of the control of
money and credit in the hands of these few men...
Under our system of issuing and distributing
corporate securities the investing public does not buy directly from the
corporation.
The securities travel from the issuing house
through middlemen to the investor. It is only the great banks or bankers
with access to the mainsprings of the concentrated resources made up of
other people's money, in the banks, trust companies, and life insurance
companies, and with control of the machinery for creating markets and
distributing securities, who have had the power to underwrite or guarantee
the sale of large-scale security issues.
The men who through their control over the funds
of our railroad and industrial companies are able to direct where such funds
shall be kept, and thus to create these great reservoirs of the people's
money are the ones who are in a position to tap those reservoirs for the
ventures in which they are interested and to prevent their being tapped for
purposes which they do not approve...
When we consider, also, in this connection that into these reservoirs of
money and credit there flow a large part of the reserves of the banks of the
country, that they are also the agents and correspondents of the out-of-town
banks in the loaning of their surplus funds in the only public money market
of the country, and that a small group of men and their partners and
associates have now further strengthened their hold upon the resources of
these institutions by acquiring large stock holdings therein, by
representation on their boards and through valuable patronage, we begin to
realize something of the extent to which this practical and effective
domination and control over our greatest financial, railroad and industrial
corporations has developed, largely within the past five years, and that it
is fraught with peril to the welfare of the country.1
Such was the nature of the wealth and power represented by those seven men
who gathered in secret that night and travelled in the luxury of Senator
Aldrich's private car.
DESTINATION JEKYLL ISLAND
As the train neared its destination of Raleigh, North Carolina, the next
afternoon, it slowed and then stopped in the switching yard just outside the
station terminal.
Quickly, the crew threw a switch, and the engine
nudged the last car onto a siding where, just as quickly, it was uncoupled
and left behind. When passengers stepped onto the platform at the terminal a
few moments later, their train appeared exactly as it had been when they
boarded.
They could not know that their travelling
companions for the night, at that very instant, were joining still another
train which, within the hour, would depart Southbound once again.
The elite group of financiers was embarked on a thousand-mile Journey that
led them to Atlanta, then to Savannah and, finally, to the small town of
Brunswick, Georgia. At first, it would seem that Brunswick was an unlikely
destination. Located on the Atlantic seaboard, it was primarily a fishing
village with a small but lively port for cotton and lumber. It had a
population of only a few thousand people.
But, by that time, the Sea Islands that
sheltered the coast from South Carolina to Florida already had become
popular as winter resorts for the very wealthy. One such island, just off
the coast of Brunswick, had recently been purchased by J.P. Morgan and
several of his business associates, and it was here that they came in the
fall and winter to hunt ducks or deer and to escape the rigors of cold
weather in the North. It was called Jekyll Island.
When the Aldrich car was uncoupled onto a siding at the small Brunswick
station, it was, indeed, conspicuous. Word travelled quickly to the office
of the town's weekly newspaper. While the group was waiting to be
transferred to the dock, several people from the paper approached and began
asking questions.
Who were Mr. Aldrich's guests? Why were they
here? Was there anything special happening?
Mr. Davison, who was one of the owners of Jekyll
Island and who was well known to the local paper, told them that these were
merely personal friends and that they had come for the simple amusement of
duck hunting. Satisfied that there was no real news in the event, the
reporters returned to their office.
Even after arrival at the remote island lodge, the secrecy continued. For
nine days the rule for first-names-only remained in effect. Full-time
caretakers and servants had been given vacation, and an entirely new,
carefully screened staff was brought in for the occasion. This was done to
make absolutely sure that none of the servants might recognize by sight the
identities of these guests.
It is difficult to imagine any event in history
- including preparation for war - that was shielded from public view with
greater mystery and secrecy.
The purpose of this meeting on Jekyll Island was not to hunt ducks. Simply
stated, it was to come to an agreement on the structure and operation of a
banking cartel. The goal of the cartel, as is true with all of them, was to
maximize profits by minimizing competition between members, to make it
difficult for new competitors to enter the field, and to utilize the police
power of government to enforce the cartel agreement.
In more specific terms, the purpose and, indeed,
the actual outcome of this meeting was to create the blueprint for the
Federal Reserve System.
THE STORY IS CONFIRMED
For many years after the event, educators, commentators, and historians
denied that the Jekyll Island meeting ever took place.
Even now, the accepted view is that the meeting
was relatively unimportant, and only paranoid unsophisticates would try to
make anything out of it.
Ron Chernow writes:
"The Jekyll Island meeting would be the
fountain of a thousand conspiracy theories."
Little by little, however, the story has been
pieced together in amazing detail, and it has come directly or indirectly
from those who actually were there.
Furthermore, if what they say about their own
purposes and actions does not constitute a classic conspiracy, then there is
little meaning to that word.
The first leak regarding this meeting found its way into print in 1916. It
appeared in Leslie's Weekly and was written by a young financial reporter by
the name of B.C. Forbes, who later founded Forbes Magazine. The article was
primarily in praise of Paul Warburg, and it is likely that Warburg
let the story out during conversations with the writer.
At any rate, the opening paragraph contained a
dramatic but highly accurate summary of both the nature and purpose of the
meeting:
Picture a party of the nation's greatest
bankers stealing out of New York on a private railroad car under cover
of darkness, stealthily hieing hundreds of miles South, embarking on a
mysterious launch, sneaking on to an island deserted by all but a few
servants, living there a full week under such rigid secrecy that the
names of not one of them was once mentioned lest the servants learn the
identity and disclose to the world this strangest, most secret
expedition in the history of American finance.
I am not romancing. I am giving to the world,
for the first time, the real story of how the famous Aldrich currency
report, the foundation of our new currency system, was written.2

An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance (New York:
Atlantic Monthly Press, 1990), p. 129.
2 - "Men Who Are Making America/' by
B.C. Forbes, Leslie's Weekly, October 19, 1916, p. 423.
In 1930, Paul Warburg wrote a massive book -
1750 pages in all - entitled The Federal Reserve System, Its Origin and
Growth. In this tome, he described the meeting and its purpose but did
not mention eitheNts location or the names of those who attended.
But he did say:
"The results of the conference were entirely
confidential. Even the fact there had been a meeting was not permitted
to become public."
Then, in a footnote he added:
"Though eighteen years have since gone by, I
do not feel free to give a description of this most interesting
conference concerning which Senator Aldrich pledged all participants to
secrecy." 1
An interesting insight to Paul Warburg's
attendance at the Jekyll Island meeting came thirty-four years later, in a
book written by his son, James.
James had been appointed by F.D.R. as Director
of the Budget and, during World War II, as head of the Office of War
Information. In his book he described how his father, who didn't know one
end of a gun from the other, borrowed a shotgun from a friend and carried it
with him to the train to disguise himself as a duck hunter.2
This part of the story was corroborated in the official biography of Senator
Aldrich, written by Nathaniel Wright Stephenson:
In the autumn of 1910, six men [in addition
to Aldrich] went out to shoot ducks. That is to say, they told the world
that was their purpose. Mr. Warburg, who was of the number, gives an
amusing account of his feelings when he boarded a private car in Jersey
City, bringing with him all the accoutrements of a duck shooter. The
joke was in the fact that he had never shot a duck in his life and had
no intention of shooting any... The duck shoot was a blind.3
Stephenson continues with a description of the
encounter at Brunswick station.
He tells us that, shortly after they arrived,
the station master walked into the private car and shocked them by his
apparent knowledge of the identities of everyone on board. To make matters
even worse, he said that a group of reporters were waiting outside.
Davison took charge.
"Come outside, old man," he said, "and I
will tell you a story."
No one claims to know what story was told
standing on the railroad ties that morning, but a few moments later Davison
returned with a broad smile on his face.
"It's all right," he said reassuringly.
"They won't give us away."
Stephenson continues:
"The rest is silence. The reporters
dispersed, and the secret of the strange journey was not divulged. No
one asked him how he managed it and he did not volunteer the
information."4

In the February 9, 1935, issue of the Saturday
Evening Post, an article appeared written by Frank Vanderlip.
In it he said:
Despite my views about the value to society
of greater publicity for the affairs of corporations, there was an
occasion, near the close of 1910, when I was as secretive - indeed, as
furtive - as any conspirator... I do not feel it is any exaggeration to
speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the
actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve
System...
We were told to leave our last names behind
us. We were told, further, that we should avoid dining together on the
night of our departure. We were instructed to come one at a time and as
unobtrusively as possible to the railroad terminal on the New Jersey
littoral of the Hudson, where Senator Aldrich's private car would be in
readiness, attached to the rear end of a train for the South...
Once aboard the private car we began to observe the taboo that had been
fixed on last names. We addressed one another as "Ben," "Paul,"
"Nelson," "Abe" - it is Abraham Piatt Andrew. Davison and I adopted even
deeper disguises, abandoning our first names.
On the theory that we were always right, he
became Wilbur and I became Orville, after those two aviation pioneers,
the Wright brothers...
The servants and train crew may have known
the identities of one or two of us, but they did not know all, and it
was the names of all printed together that would have made our
mysterious journey significant in Washington, in Wall Street, even in
London.
Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen,
or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be
exposed publicly that our particular group had got together and written
a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by
Congress.
THE STRUCTURE WAS PURE CARTEL
The composition of the Jekyll Island meeting was a classic example of cartel
structure.
A cartel is a group of independent businesses
which join together to coordinate the production, pricing, or marketing of
their members. The purpose of a cartel is to reduce competition and thereby
increase profitability. This is accomplished through a shared monopoly over
their industry which forces the public to pay higher prices for their goods
or services than would be otherwise required under free-enterprise
competition.
Here were representatives of the world's leading banking consortia:
-
Morgan
-
Rockefeller
-
Rothschild
-
Warburg
-
Kuhn-Loeb
They were often competitors, and there is little
doubt that there was considerable distrust between them and skillful
maneuvering for favored position in any agreement. But they were driven
together by one overriding desire to fight their common enemy.
The enemy was competition.
In 1910, the number of banks in the United States was growing at a
phenomenal rate. In fact, it had more than doubled to over twenty thousand
in just the previous ten years. Furthermore, most of them were springing up
in the South and West, causing the New York banks to suffer a steady decline
of market share.
Almost all banks in the 1880s were national
banks, which means they were chartered by the federal government. Generally,
they were located in the big cities, and were allowed by law to issue their
own currency in the form of bank notes.
Even as early as 1896, however, the number of
non-national banks had grown to sixty-one per cent, and they already held
fifty-four per cent of the country's total banking deposits. By 1913, when
the Federal Reserve Act was passed, those numbers were seventy-one per cent
non-national banks holding fifty-seven per cent of the deposits.1
In the eyes of those duck hunters from New York,
this was a trend that simply had to be reversed.
1. See Gabriel Kolko, Tlie
Triumph of Conservatism (New York: The Free Press of Glencoe, a division of
the Macmillan Co., 1963), p. 140.
Competition also was coming from a new trend in industry to finance future
growth out of profits rather than from borrowed capital. This was the
outgrowth of free-market interest rates which set a realistic balance
between debt and thrift.
Rates were low enough to attract serious
borrowers who were confident of the success of their business ventures and
of their ability to repay, but they were high enough to discourage loans for
frivolous ventures or those for which there were alternative sources of
funding - for example, one's own capital. That balance between debt and
thrift was the result of a limited money supply.
Banks could create loans in excess of their
actual deposits, as we shall see, but there was a limit to that process. And
that limit was ultimately determined by the supply of gold they held.
Consequently, between 1900 and 1910, seventy per cent of the funding for
American corporate growth was generated internally, making industry
increasingly independent of the banks.1
Even the federal government was becoming
thrifty. It had a growing stockpile of gold, was systematically redeeming
the Greenbacks - which had been issued during the Civil War - and was
rapidly reducing the national debt.
Here was another trend that had to be halted. What the bankers wanted - and
what many businessmen wanted also - was to intervene in the free market and
tip the balance of interest rates downward, to favor debt over thrift.
To accomplish this, the money supply simply had
to be disconnected from gold and made more plentiful or, as they described
it, more elastic.
THE SPECTER OF BANK FAILURE
The greatest threat, however, came, not from rivals or private capital
formation, but from the public at large in the form of what bankers call a
run on the bank.
This is because, when banks accept a customer's
deposit, they give in return a "balance" in his account. This is the
equivalent of a promise to pay back the deposit anytime he wants. Likewise,
when another customer borrows money from the bank, he also is given an
account balance which usually is withdrawn immediately to satisfy the
purpose of the loan.
This creates a ticking time bomb because, at
that point, the bank has issued more promises to "pay-on-demand" than it has
money in the vault. Even though the depositing customer thinks he can get
his money any time he wants, in reality it has been given to the borrowing
customer and no longer is available at the bank.
The problem is compounded further by the fact that banks are allowed to loan
even more money than they have received in deposit. The mechanism for
accomplishing this seemingly impossible feat will be described in a later
chapter, but it is a fact of modern banking that promises-to-pay often
exceed savings deposits by a factor of ten-to-one.
And, because only about three per cent of these
accounts are actually retained in the vault in the form of cash - the rest
having been put into even more loans and investments - the bank's promises
exceed its ability to keep those promises by a factor of over three
hundred-to-one.2
1. William Greider, Secrets ofthe
Temple (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987), p. 274, 275. Also Kolko, p. 145
2. Another way of putting it is that their reserves are underfunded by over
33,333% (10-to-1 divided by .03 = 333.333-to-l . That divided by .01 =
33333%.)
As long as only a small percentage
of depositors request their money at one time, no one is the wiser. But if
public confidence is shaken, and if more than a few per cent attempt to
withdraw their funds, the scheme is finally exposed. The bank cannot keep
all its promises and is forced to close its doors.
Bankruptcy usually follows in due course.
CURRENCY DRAINS
The same result could happen - and, prior to the Federal Reserve System,
often did happen - even without depositors making a run on the bank.
Instead of withdrawing their funds at the
teller's window, they simply wrote checks to purchase goods or services.
People receiving those checks took them to a bank for deposit. If that bank
happened to be the same one from which the check was drawn, then all was
well, because it was not necessary to remove any real money from the vault.
But if the holder of the check took it to
another bank, it was quickly passed back to the issuing bank and settlement
was demanded between banks.
This is not a one-way street, however.
While the Downtown Bank is demanding payment
from the Uptown Bank, the Uptown Bank is also clearing checks and demanding
payment from the Downtown bank. As long as the money flow in both directions
is equal, then everything can be handled with simple bookkeeping. But if the
flow is not equal, then one of the banks will have to actually send money to
the other to make up the difference.
If the amount of money required exceeds a few
percentage points of the bank's total deposits, the result is the same as a
run on the bank by depositors. This demand of money by other banks rather
than by depositors is called a currency drain.
In 1910, the most common cause of a bank having to declare bankruptcy due to
a currency drain was that it followed a loan policy that was more reckless
than that of its competitors. More money was demanded from it because more
money was loaned by it.
It was dangerous enough to loan ninety per cent
of their customers' savings (keeping only one dollar in reserve out of every
ten), but that had proven to be adequate most of the time. Some banks,
however, were tempted to walk even closer to the precipice.
They pushed the ratio to ninety-too per cent,
ninety-five per cent, ninety-nine per cent. After all, the way a bank makes
money is to collect interest, and the only way to do that is to make loans.
The more loans, the better. And, so, there was a practice among some of the
more reckless banks to "loan up," as they call it.
Which was another way of saying to push dawn
their reserve ratios.
A BANKERS' UTOPIA
If all banks could be forced to issue loans in the same ratio to their
reserves as other banks did, then, regardless of how small that ratio was,
the amount of checks to be cleared between them would balance in the long
run.
No major currency drains would ever occur.
The entire banking industry might collapse under
such a system, but not individual banks - at least not those that were part
of the cartel. All would walk the same distance from the edge, regardless of
how close it was. Under such uniformity, no individual bank could be blamed
for failure to meet its obligations. The blame could be shifted, instead, to
the "economy" or "government policy" or "interest rates" or "trade deficits"
or the "exchange-value of the dollar" or even to the "capitalist system"
itself.
But, in 1910, such a bankers' utopia had not yet been created. If the
Downtown bank began to loan at a greater ratio to its reserves than its
competitors, the amount of checks which would come back to it for payment
also would be greater.
Thus, the bank which pursued a more reckless
lending policy had to draw against its reserves in order to make payments to
the more conservative banks and, when those funds were exhausted, it usually
was forced into bankruptcy.
Historian John Klein tells us that,
"The financial panics of 1873, 1884, 1893,
and 1907 were in large part an outgrowth of... reserve pyramiding and
excessive deposit creation by reserve city... banks. These panics were
triggered by the currency drains that took place in periods of relative
prosperity when banks were loaned up." 1
In other words, the "panics" and resulting bank
failures were caused, not by negative factors in the economy, but by
currency drains on the banks which were loaned up to the point where they
had practically no reserves at all.
The banks did not fail because the system was
weak. The system failed because the banks were weak.
This was another common problem that brought these seven men over a thousand
miles to a tiny island off the shore of Georgia. Each was a potentially
fierce competitor, but uppermost in their prtinds were the so-called panics
and the very real 1,748 bankfailures of the preceding two decades. Somehow,
they had to join forces. A method had to be devised to enable them to
continue to make more promises to pay-on-demand than they could keep.
To do this, they had to find a way to force all
banks to walk the same distance from the edge, and, when the inevitable
disasters happened, to shift public blame away from themselves. By making it
appear to be a problem of the national economy rather than of private
banking practice, the door then could be opened for the use of tax money
rather than their own funds for paying off the losses.
Here, then, were the main challenges that faced that tiny but powerful group
assembled on Jekyll Island:
-
How to stop the growing influence of
small, rival banks and to insure that control over the nation's
financial resources would remain in the hands of those present
-
How to make the money supply more
elastic in order to reverse the trend of private capital formation
and to recapture the industrial loan market
-
How to pool the meager reserves of the
nation's banks into one large reserve so that all banks will be
motivated to follow the same loan-to-deposit ratios. This would
protect at least some of them from currency drains and bank runs
-
Should this lead eventually to the
collapse of the whole banking system, then how to shift the losses
from the owners of the banks to the taxpayers
THE CARTEL ADOPTS A NAME
Everyone knew that the solution to
all these problems was a cartel mechanism that had been devised and already
put into similar operation in Europe. As with all cartels, it had to be
created by legislation and sustained by the power of government under the
deception of protecting the consumer.
The most important task before them, therefore,
can be stated as objective number five:
-
How to convince Congress that the scheme
was a measure to protect the public.
The task was a delicate one.
The American people did not like the concept of
a cartel. The idea of business enterprises joining together to fix prices
and prevent competition was alien to the free-enterprise system. It could
never be sold to the voters. But, if the word cartel was not used, if the
venture could be described
with words which are emotionally neutral - perhaps even alluring - then half
the battle would be won.
The first decision, therefore, was to follow the practice adopted in Europe.
Henceforth, the cartel would operate as a
central bank. And even that was to be but a generic expression. For purposes
of public relations and legislation, they would devise a name that would
avoid the word bank altogether and which would conjure the image of the
federal government itself.
Furthermore, to create the impression that there
would be no concentration of power, they would establish regional branches
of the cartel and make that a main selling point.
Stephenson tells us:
"Aldrich entered this discussion at Jekyll
Island an ardent convert to the idea of a central bank. His desire was
to transplant the system of one of the great European banks, say the
Bank of England, bodily to America."
But political expediency required that such
plans be concealed from the public.
As John Kenneth Galbraith explained it:
"It was his [Aldrich's] thought to outflank
the opposition by having not one central bank but many. And the word
bank would itself be avoided." 2
1. Stephenson, p. 378.
2. John Kenneth Galbraith, Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went (Boston:
Houghton Mifflin, 1975), p. 122.
With the exception of Aldrich, all of those present were bankers, but only
one was an expert on the European model of a central bank.
Because of this knowledge, Paul Warburg became
the dominant and guiding mind throughout all of the discussions. Even a
casual perusal of the literature on the creation of the Federal Reserve
System is sufficient to find that he was, indeed, the cartel's mastermind.
Galbraith says,
"... Warburg has, with some justice, been
called the father of the system."
Professor Edwin Seligman, a member of the
international banking family of J. & W. Seligman, and head of the Department
of Economics at Columbia University, writes that,
"... in its fundamental features, the
Federal Reserve Act is the work of Mr. Warburg more than any other man
in the country."
THE REAL DADDY WARBUCKS
Paul Moritz Warburg was a leading member of the investment banking firm of
M.M. Warburg & Company of Hamburg, Germany, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
He had come to the United States only nine years
previously. Soon after arrival, however, and with funding provided mostly by
the Rothschild group, he and his brother, Felix, had been able to buy
partnerships in the New York investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb &
Company, while continuing as partners in Warburg of Hamburg.1
1. Anthony Sutton, Wall Street and FDR
(New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1975), p. 92.
Within twenty years, Paul would become one of
the wealthiest men in America with an unchallenged domination over the
country's railroad system.
At this distance in history, it is difficult to appreciate the importance of
this man. But some understanding may be had from the fact that the legendary
character, Daddy Warbucks, in the comic strip Little Orphan Annie, was a
contemporary commentary on the presumed benevolence of Paul Warburg, and the
almost magic ability to accomplish good through the power of his unlimited
wealth.
A third brother, Max Warburg, was the financial adviser of the Kaiser and
became Director of the Reichsbank in Germany.
This was, of course, a central bank, and it was
one of the cartel models used in the construction of the Federal Reserve
System. The Reichsbank, incidentally, a few years later would create the
massive hyperinflation that occurred in Germany, wiping out the middle class
and the entire German economy as well.
Paul Warburg soon became well known on Wall Street as a persuasive advocate
for a central bank in America. Three years before the Jekyll Island meeting,
he had published several pamphlets. One was entitled Defects and Needs of
Our Banking System, and the other was A Plan for A Modified Central Bank.
These attracted wide attention in both financial
and academic circles and set the intellectual climate for all future
discussions regarding banking legislation. In these treatises, Warburg
complained that the American monetary system was crippled by its dependency
on gold and government bonds, both of which were in limited supply.
What America needed, he argued, was an elastic
money supply that could be expanded and contracted to accommodate the
fluctuating needs of commerce. The solution, he said, was to follow the
German example whereby banks could create currency solely on the basis of
"commercial paper," which is banker language for I.O.U.s from corporations.
Warburg was tireless in his efforts. He was a featured speaker before scores
of influential audiences and wrote a steady stream of published articles on
the subject.
In March of that year, for example, The Nezv
York Times published an eleven-part series written by Warburg explaining and
expounding what he called the Reserve Bank of the United States.1
THE MESSAGE WAS PLAIN FOR THOSE WHO UNDERSTOOD
Most of Warburg's writing and lecturing on this topic was eyewash for the
public.
To cover the fact that a central bank is merely
a cartel which has been legalized, its proponents had to lay down a thick
smoke screen of technical jargon focusing always on how it would supposedly
benefit commerce, the public, and the nation; how it would lower interest
rates, provide funding for needed industrial projects, and prevent panics in
the economy.
There was not the slightest glimmer that,
underneath it all, was a master plan which was designed from top to bottom
to serve private interests at the expense of the public.
This was, nevertheless, the cold reality, and the more perceptive bankers
were well aware of it. In an address before the American Bankers Association
the following year, Aldrich laid it out for anyone who was really listening
to the meaning of his words.
He said:
"The organization proposed is not a bank,
but a cooperative union of all the banks of the country for definite
purposes." 2
Precisely. A union of banks.
1. See J. Lawrence Laughlin, The
Federal Reserve Act: Its Origin and Problems (New York: Macmillan, 1933), p.
9.
2. The full text of the speech is reprinted by Herman E. Krooss and Paul A.
Samuelson, Vol. 3, p. 1202.
Two years later, in a speech before that same group of bankers, A. Barton
Hepburn of Chase National Bank was even more candid.
He said:
"The measure recognizes and adopts the
principles of a central bank. Indeed, if it works out as the sponsors of
the law hope, it will make all incorporated banks together joint owners
of a central dominating power." 1
And that is about as good a definition of a
cartel as one is likely to find.
In 1914, one year after the Federal Reserve Act was passed into law, Senator
Aldrich could afford to be less guarded in his remarks.
In an article published in July of that year in
a magazine called The Independent, he boasted:
"Before the passage of this Act, the New
York bankers could only dominate the reserves of New York. Now we are
able to dominate the bank reserves of the entire country."
MYTH ACCEPTED AS HISTORY
The accepted version of history is that the Federal Reserve was created to
stabilize our economy.
One of the most widely-used textbooks on this
subject says:
"It sprang from the panic of 1907, with its
alarming epidemic of bank failures: the country was fed up once and for
all with the anarchy of unstable private banking." 2
Even the most naive student must sense a grave
contradiction between this cherished view and the System's actual
performance.
Since its inception, it has presided over the
crashes of 1921 and 1929; the Great Depression of '29 to '39; recessions in
'53, '57, '69, '75, and '81; a stock market "Black Monday" in '87; and a
1000% inflation which has destroyed 90% of the dollar's purchasing power.3
Let us be more specific on that last point By 1990, an annual income of
$10,000 was required to buy what took only $1,000 in 1914.4
1. Quoted by KoLko, Triumph, p. 235.

Journal of Money and Banking, February, 1990.
4. When one considers that the income tax had just been introduced in 1913
and that such low figures were completely exempt, an income at that time of
$1,000 actually was the equivalent of earning $15,400 now, before paying 35%
taxes. When the amount now taken by state and local governments is added to
the total bite, the figure is close to $20,000.
That incredible loss in value was quietly
transferred to the federal government in the form of hidden taxation, and
the Federal Reserve System was the mechanism by which it was accomplished.
Actions have consequences.
The consequences of wealth confiscation by the
Federal-Reserve mechanism are now upon us.
In the current decade,
-
corporate debt is soaring
-
personal debt is greater than ever
-
both business and personal bankruptcies
are at an all-time high
-
banks and savings and loan associations
are failing in larger numbers than ever before
-

-

we are facing an international trade
deficit for the first time in our history
-
75% of downtown Los Angeles and other
metropolitan areas is now owned by foreigners
-
over half of our nation is in a state of
economic recession
FIRST REASON TO ABOLISH THE SYSTEM
That is the scorecard eighty years after the Federal Reserve was created
supposedly to stabilize our economy!
There can be no argument that the System has
failed in its stated objectives. Furthermore, after all this time, after
repeated changes in personnel, after operating under both political parties,
after numerous experiments in monetary philosophy, after almost a hundred
revisions to its charter, and after the development of countless new
formulas and techniques, there has been more than ample opportunity to work
out mere procedural flaws.
It is not unreasonable to conclude, therefore,
that the System has failed, not because it needs a new set of rules or more
intelligent directors, but because it is incapable of achieving its stated
objectives.
If an institution is incapable of achieving its objectives, there is no
reason to preserve it - unless it can be altered in some way to change its
capability. That leads to the question: why is the System incapable of
achieving its stated objectives?
The painful answer is: those were never its true
objectives.
When one realizes the circumstances under which
it was created, when one contemplates the identities of those who authored
it, and when one studies its actual performance over the years, it becomes
obvious that the System is merely a cartel with a government facade. There
is no doubt that those who run it are motivated to maintain full employment,
high productivity, low inflation, and a generally sound economy.
They are not interested in killing the goose
that lays such beautiful golden eggs. But, when there is a conflict between
the public interest and the private needs of the cartel - a conflict that
arises almost daily - the public will be sacrificed. That is the nature of
the beast. It is foolish to expect a cartel to act in any other way.
This view is not encouraged by Establishment institutions and publishers. It
has become their apparent mission to convince the American people that the
system is not intrinsically flawed. It merely has been in the hands of
bumbling oafs.
For example, William Greider was a former
Assistant Managing Editor for The Washington Post. His book, Secrets of The
Temple, was published in 1987 by Simon and Schuster. It was critical of the
Federal Reserve because of its failures, but, according to Greider, these
were not caused by any defect in the System itself, but merely because the
economic factors are "sooo complicated" that the good men who have struggled
to make the System work have just not yet been able to figure it all out.
But, don't worry, folks, they're working on it!
That is exactly the kind of powder-puff criticism which is acceptable in our
mainstream media. Yet, Greider's own research points to an entirely
different interpretation.
Speaking of the System's origin, he says:
As new companies prospered without Wall
Street, so did the hew regional banks that handled their funds, New
York's concentrated share of bank deposits was still huge, about half
the nation's total, but it was declining steadily. Wall Street was still
"the biggest kid on the block," but less and less able to bully the
others.
This trend was a crucial fact of history, a
misunderstood reality that completely alters the political meaning of
the reform legislation that created the Federal Reserve. At the time,
the conventional wisdom in Congress, widely shared and sincerely
espoused by Progressive reformers, was that a government institution
would finally harness the "money trust," disarm its powers, and
establish broad democratic control over money and credit... The results
were nearly the opposite.
The money reforms enacted in 1913, in fact,
helped to preserve the status quo, to stabilize the old order.
Money-center bankers would not only gain dominance over the new central
bank, but would also enjoy new insulation against instability and their
own decline. Once the Fed was in operation, the steady diffusion of
financial power halted.
Wall Street maintained its dominant position
- and even enhanced it.1
Anthony Sutton, former Research Fellow at the
Hoover Institution for War, Revolution and Peace, and also Professor of
Economics at California State University, Los Angeles, provides a somewhat
deeper analysis.
1. Greider, p. 275.
He writes:
Warburg's revolutionary plan to get American
Society to go to work for Wall Street was astonishingly simple.
Even today,... academic theoreticians cover
their blackboards with meaningless equations, and the general public
struggles in bewildered confusion with inflation and the coming credit
collapse, while the quite simple explanation of the problem goes
undiscussed and almost entirely uncomprehended.
The Federal Reserve System is a legal
private monopoly of the money supply operated for the benefit of the few
under the guise of protecting and promoting the public interest.1
The real significance of the journey to Jekyll
Island and the creature that was hatched there was inadvertently summarized
by the words of Paul Warburg's admiring biographer, Harold Kellock:
Paul M. Warburg is probably the
mildest-mannered man that ever personally conducted a revolution. It was
a bloodless revolution: he did not attempt to rouse the populace to
arms. He stepped forth armed simply with an idea. And he conquered.
That's the amazing thing. A shy, sensitive
man, he imposed his idea on a nation of a hundred million people.2

SUMMARY
The basic plan for the Federal Reserve System was drafted at a secret
meeting held in November of 1910 at the private resort of J.P. Morgan on
Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia.
Those who attended represented the great
financial institutions of Wall Street and, indirectly, Europe as well. The
reason for secrecy was simple. Had it been known that rival factions of the
banking community had joined together, the public would have been alerted to
the possibility that the bankers were plotting an agreement in restraint of
trade - which, of course, is exactly what they were doing.
What emerged was a cartel agreement with five
objectives: stop the growing competition from the nation's newer banks;
obtain a franchise to create money out of nothing for the purpose of
lending; get control of the reserves of all banks so that the more reckless
-ones would not be exposed to currency drains and bank runs; get the
taxpayer to pick up the cartel's inevitable losses; and convince Congress
that the purpose was to protect the public.
It was realized that the bankers would have to
become partners with the politicians and that the structure of the cartel
would have to be a central bank. The record shows that the Fed has failed to
achieve its stated Objectives. That is because those were never its true
goals.
As a banking cartel, and in terms of the five
objectives stated above, it has been an Unqualified success.
Chapter
Two
THE NAME OF THE GAME IS BAILOUT
The analogy of a spectator sporting event as a means of explaining the rules
by which taxpayers are required to pick up the cost of bailing out the banks
when their loans go sour.
It was stated in the previous chapter that the Jekyll Island group which
conceived the Federal Reserve System actually created a national cartel
which was dominated by the larger banks. It was also stated that a primary
objective of that cartel was to involve the federal government as an agent
for shifting the inevitable losses from the owners of those banks to the
taxpayers.
That, of course, is one of the more
controversial assertions made in this book.
Yet, there is little room for any other
interpretation when one confronts the massive evidence of history since the
System was created. Let us, therefore, take another leap through time.
Having jumped to the year 1910 to begin this story, let us now return to the
present era.
To understand how banking losses are shifted to the taxpayers, it is first
necessary to know a little bit about how the scheme was designed to work
There are certain procedures and formulas which must be understood or else
the entire process seems like chaos. It is as though we had been isolated
all our lives on a South Sea island with no knowledge of the outside world.
Imagine what it would then be like the first time we travelled to the
mainland and witnessed a game of professional football.
We would stare with incredulity at men dressed
like aliens from another planet; throwing their bodies against each other;
tossing a funny shaped object hack and forth; fighting over it as though it
were of great value, yet, occasionally kicking it out of the area as though
it were worthless and despised; chasing each other, knocking each other to
the ground and then walking away to regroup for another surge; all this with
tens of thousand of spectators riotously shouting in unison for no apparent
reason at all.
Without a basic understanding that this was a
game and without knowledge of the rules of that game, the event would appear
as total chaos and universal madness.
The operation of our monetary system through the Federal Reserve has much in
common with professional football.
-
First, there are certain plays that are
repeated over and over again with only minor variations to suit the
special circumstances.
-
Second, there are definite rules which
the players follow with great precision.
-
Third, there is a clear objective to the
game which is uppermost in the minds of the players.
-
And fourth, if the spectators are not
familiar with that objective and if they do not understand the
rules, they will never comprehend what is going on.
Which, as far as monetary matters is concerned,
is the common state of the vast majority of Americans today.
Let us, therefore, attempt to spell out in plain language what that
objective is and how the players expect to achieve it. To demystify the
process, we shall present an overview first. After the concepts are
clarified, we then shall follow up with actual examples taken from the
recent past.
The name of the game is Bailout. As stated previously, the objective of this
game is to shift the inevitable losses from the owners of the larger banks
to the taxpayers.
The procedure by which this is accomplished is
as follows:
RULES OF THE GAME
The game begins when the Federal
Reserve System allows commercial banks to create checkbook money out of
nothing. (Details regarding how this incredible feat is accomplished are
given in chapter ten entitled The Mandrake Mechanism.)
The banks derive profit from this easy money,
not by spending it, but by lending it to others and collecting interest.
When such a loan is placed on the bank's books it is shown as an asset
because it is earning interest and, presumably, someday will be paid back.
At the same time an equal entry is made on the liability side of the ledger.
That is because the newly created checkbook money now is in circulation, and
most of it will end up in other banks which will return the canceled checks
to the issuing bank for payment. Individuals may also bring some of this
checkbook money back to the bank and request cash. The issuing bank,
therefore, has a potential money pay-out liability equal to the amount of
the loan asset.
When a borrower cannot repay and there are no assets which can be taken to
compensate, the bank must write off that loan as a loss- However, since most
of the money originally was created out of nothing and cost the bank nothing
except bookkeeping overhead, there is little of tangible value that is
actual lost. It is primarily a bookkeeping entry.
A bookkeeping loss can still be undesirable to a bank because it causes the
loan to be removed from the ledger as an asset without a reduction in
liabilities. The difference must come from the equity of those who own the
bank. In other words, the loan asset is removed, but the money liability
remains. The original checkbook money is still circulating out there even
though the borrower cannot repay, and the issuing bank still has the
obligation to redeem those checks.
The only way to do this and balance the books
once again is to draw upon the capital which was invested by the bank's
stockholders or to deduct the loss from the bank's current profits. In
either case, the owners of the bank lose an amount equal to the value of the
defaulted loan.
So, to them, the loss becomes very real. If the
bank is forced to write off a large amount of bad loans, the amount could
exceed the entire value of the owners' equity. When that happens, the game
is over, and the bank is insolvent.
This concern would be sufficient to motivate most bankers to be Very
conservative in their loan policy, and in fact most of them do act with
great caution when dealing with individuals and small businesses.
But the Federal Reserve System, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Deposit Loan Corporation now
guarantee that massive loans made to large corporations and to other
governments will not be allowed to fall entirely upon the bank's owners
should those loans go into default.
This is done under the argument that, if these
corporations or banks are allowed to fail, the nation would suffer from vast
unemployment and economic disruption.
More on that in a moment.
THE PERPETUAL-DEBT PLAY
The end result of this policy is that
the banks have little motive to be cautious and are protected against the
effect of their own folly.
The larger the loan, the better it is, because
it will produce the greatest amount of profit with the least amount of
effort A single loan to a third-world country netting hundreds of millions
of dollars in annual interest is just as easy to process - if not easier -
than a loan for $50,000 to a local merchant on the shopping mall. If the
interest is paid, it's gravy time.
If the loan defaults, the federal government
will "protect the public" and, through various mechanisms described shortly,
will make sure that the banks continue to receive their interest.
The individual and the small businessman find it increasingly difficult to
borrow money at reasonable rates, because the banks can make more money on
loans to the corporate giants and to foreign governments. Also, the bigger
loans are safer for the banks, because the government will make them good
even if they default.
There are no such guarantees for the small
loans. The public will not swallow the line that bailing out the little guy
is necessary to save the system. The dollar amounts are too small. Only when
the figures become mind-boggling does the ploy become plausible.
It is important to remember that banks do not really want to have their
loans repaid, except as evidence of the dependability of the borrower.
They make a profit from interest on the loan,
not repayment of the loan. If a loan is paid off, the bank merely has to
find another borrower, and that can be an expensive nuisance. It is much
better to have the existing borrower pay only the interest and never make
payments on the loan itself. That process is called rolling over the debt.
One of the reasons banks prefer to lend to governments is that they do not
expect those loans ever to be repaid.
When Walter Wriston was chairman of the
Citicorp Bank in 1982, he extolled the virtue of the action this way:
If we had a truth-in-Government act
comparable to the truth-in-advertising law, every note issued by the
Treasury would be obliged to include a sentence stating: "This note will
be redeemed with the proceeds from an identical note which will be sold
to the public when this one comes due."
When this activity is carried out in the United
States, as it is weekly, it is described as a Treasury bill auction.
But when basically the same process is conducted
abroad in a foreign language, our news media usually speak of a country's
"rolling over its debts." The perception remains that some form of disaster
is inevitable. It is not.
To see why, it is only necessary to understand the basic facts of government
borrowing. The first is that there are few recorded instances in history of
government - any government - actually getting out of debt.
Certainly in an era of $100-billion deficits, no
one lending money to our Government by buying a Treasury bill expects that
it will be paid at maturity in any way except by our Government's selling a
new bill of like amount.1
1. "Banking Against Disaster/' by
Walter B. Wriston, The New York Times, September 14, 1982.
THE DEBT ROLL-OVER PLAY
Since the system makes it profitable for banks to make large, unsound loans,
that is the kind of loans which banks will make.
Furthermore, it is predictable that most unsound
loans eventually will go into default. When the borrower finally declares
that he cannot pay, the bank responds by rolling over the loan.
This often is stage managed to appear as a
concession on the part of the bank but, in reality, it is a significant
forward move toward the objective of perpetual interest.
Eventually the borrower comes to the point where he can no longer pay even
the interest. Now the play becomes more complex. The bank does not want to
lose the interest, because that is its stream of income. But it cannot
afford to allow the borrower to go into default either, because that would
require a write-off which, in turn, could wipe out the owners' equity and
put the bank out of business.
So the bank's next move is to create additional
money out of nothing and lend that to the borrower so he will have enough to
continue paying the interest, which by now must be paid on the original loan
plus the additional loan as well. What looked like certain disaster suddenly
is converted by a brilliant play into a major score.
This not only maintains the old loan on the
books as an asset, it actually increases the apparent size of that asset and
also results in higher interest payments, thus, greater profit to the bank.
THE UP-THE-ANTE PLAY
Sooner or later, the borrower becomes restless.
He is not interested in making interest payments
with nothing left for himself. He comes to realize that he is merely working
for the bank and, once again, interest payments stop. The opposing teams go
into a huddle to plan the next move, then rush to the scrimmage
line where they hurl threatening innuendoes at each other. The borrower
simply cannot, will not pay. Collect if you can. The lender threatens to
blackball the borrower, to see to it that he will never again be able to
obtain a loan.
Finally, a "compromise" is worked out.
As before, the bank agrees to create still more
money out of nothing and lend that to the borrower to cover the interest on
both of the previous loans but, this time, they up the ante to provide still
additional money for the borrower to spend on something other than interest.
That is a perfect score. The borrower suddenly has a fresh supply of money
for his purposes plus enough to keep making those bothersome interest
payments.
The bank, on the other hand, now has still
larger assets, higher interest income, and greater profits.
What an exciting game!
THE RESCHEDULING PLAY
The previous plays can be repeated several times until the reality finally
dawns on the borrower that he is sinking deeper and deeper into the debt pit
with no prospects of climbing out.
This realization usually comes when the interest
payments become so large they represent almost as much as the entire
corporate earnings or the country's total tax base. This time around,
roll-overs with larger loans are rejected, and default seems inevitable.
But wait. What's this? The players are back at the scrimmage line. There is
a great confrontation. Referees are called in. Two shrill blasts from the
horn tell us a score has been made for both sides.
A voice over the public address system
announces:
"This loan has been rescheduled".
Rescheduling usually means a combination of a
lower interest rate and a longer period for repayment.
The effect is primarily cosmetic. It reduces the
monthly payment but extends the period further into the future. This makes
the current burden to the borrower a little easier to carry, but it also
makes repayment of the capital even more unlikely.
It postpones the day of reckoning but, in the
meantime, you guessed it: The loan remains as an asset, and the interest
payments continue.
THE PROTECT-THE-PUBLIC PLAY
Eventually the day of reckoning arrives.
The borrower realizes he can never repay the
capital and flatly refuses to pay interest on it. It is time for the Final
Maneuver.
According to the Banking Safety Digest, which specializes in rating the
safety of America's banks and S&Ls, most of the banks involved with "problem
loans" are quite profitable businesses:
Note that, except for third-world loans,
most of the large banks in the country are operating quite profitably.
In contrast with the continually-worsening S&L crisis, the banks'
profitability has been the engine with which they have been working off
(albeit slowly) their overseas debt... At last year's profitability
levels, the banking industry could, in theory, "buy out" the entirety of
their own Latin American loans within two years.1
1- "Overseas Lending... Trigger for A
Severe Depression?" The Banking Safety Digest (U.S. Business Publishing/Veribanc,
Wakefield, Massachusetts), August, 1989, p. 3.
The banks can absorb the losses of their bad
loans to multinational corporations and foreign governments, but that is not
according to the rules.
It would be a major loss to the stockholders who
would receive little or no dividends during the adjustment period, and any
chief executive officer who embarked upon such a course would soon be
looking for a new job. That this is not part of I the game plan is evident
by the fact that, while a small portion of the Latin American debt has been
absorbed, the banks are continuing to make gigantic loans to governments in
other parts of the world, particularly Africa, Red China, and Eastern
European nations.
For reasons which will be analyzed in chapter
four, there is little hope that the performance of these loans will be
different than those in Latin America.
But the most important reason for not absorbing
the losses is that there is a standard play that can still [breathe life
back into those dead loans and reactivate the bountiful income stream that
flows from them.
Here's how it works.
The captains of both teams approach the Referee
and the Game Commissioner to request that the game be extended. The reason
given is that this is in the interest of the public, the spectators who are
having such a wonderful time and [who will be sad to see the game ended.
They request also that, while the spectators are
in the stadium enjoying themselves, the barking-lot attendants be ordered to
quietly remove the hub caps from every car.
These can be sold to provide money for
additional salaries for all the players, including the referee and, of
course, the Commissioner himself. That is only fair since they are now
working overtime for the benefit of the spectators. When the deal is finally
struck, the horn will blow three times, and a roar of joyous relief will
sweep across the stadium.
In a somewhat less recognizable form, the same play may look like this: The
president of the lending bank and the finance officer of the defaulting
corporation or government will join together and approach Congress. They
will explain that the borrower has exhausted his ability to service the loan
and, without assistance from the federal government, there will be dire
consequences for the American people.
Not only will there be unemployment and hardship
at home, there will be massive disruptions in world markets. And, since we
are now so dependent on those markets, our exports will drop, foreign
capital will dry up, and we will suffer greatly.
What is needed, they will say, is for Congress
to provide money to the borrower, either directly or indirectly, to allow
him to continue to pay interest on the loan and to initiate new spending
programs which will be so profitable he will soon be able to pay everyone
back.
As part of the proposal, the borrower will agree to accept the direction of
a third-party referee in adopting an austerity program to make sure that
none of the new money is wasted. The bank also will agree to write off a
small part of the loan as a gesture of its willingness to share the burden.
This move, of course, will have been foreseen from the very beginning of the
game, and is a small step backward to achieve a giant stride forward.
After all, the amount to be lost through the
write-off was created out of nothing in the first place and, without this
Final Maneuver, the entirety would be written off.
Furthermore, this modest write down is dwarfed
by the amount to be gained through restoration of the income stream.
THE GUARANTEED-PAYMENT PLAY
One of the standard variations of the
Final Maneuver is for the government, not always to directly provide the
funds, but to provide the credit for the funds.
That means to guarantee future payments should
the borrower again default. Once Congress agrees to this, the government
becomes a co-signer to the loan, and the inevitable losses are finally
lifted from the ledger of the bank and placed onto the backs of the American
taxpayer.
Money now begins to move into the banks through a complex system of federal
agencies, international agencies, foreign aid, and direct subsidies.
All of these mechanisms extract payments from
the American people and channel them to the deadbeat borrowers who then send
them to the banks to service their loans. Very little of this money actually
comes from taxes.
Almost all of it is generated by the Federal
Reserve System. When this newly created money returns to the banks, it
quickly moves out again into the economy where it mingles with and dilutes
the value of the money already there. The result is the appearance of rising
prices but which, in reality, is a lowering of the value of the dollar.
The American people have no idea they are paying the bill. They know that
someone is stealing their hub caps, but they think it is the greedy
businessman who raises prices or the selfish laborer who demands higher
wages or the unworthy farmer who demands too much for his crop or the
wealthy foreigner who bids up our prices.
They do not realize that these groups also are
victimized by a monetary system which is constantly being eroded in value by
and through the Federal Reserve System.
Public ignorance of how the game is really played was dramatically displayed
during a recent Phil Donahue TV show. The topic was the Savings and Loan
crisis and the billions of dollars that it would cost the taxpayer.
A man from the audience rose and asked angrily:
"Why can't the government pay for these
debts instead of the taxpayer?"
And the audience of several hundred people
actually cheered in enthusiastic approval!
PROSPERITY THROUGH INSOLVENCY
Since large, corporate loans are often guaranteed by the federal government,
one would think that the banks which make those loans would never have a
problem.
Yet, many of them still manage to bungle
themselves into insolvency. As we shall see in a later section of this
study, insolvency actually is inherent in the system itself, a system called
fractional-reserve banking.
Nevertheless, a bank can operate quite nicely in a state of insolvency so
long as its customers don't know it. Money is brought into being and
transmuted from one imaginary form to another by mere entries on a ledger,
and creative bookkeeping can always make the bottom line appear to balance.
The problem arises when depositors decide, for whatever reason, to withdraw
their money.
Lo and behold, there isn't enough to go around
and, when that happens, the cat is finally out of the bag. The bank must
close its doors, and the depositors still waiting in line outside are...
well, just that: still waiting.
The proper solution to this problem is to require the banks, like all other
businesses, to honor their contracts. If they tell their customers that
deposits are "payable upon demand," then they should hold enough cash to
make good on that promise, regardless of when the customers want it or how
many of them want it.
In other words, they should keep cash in the
vault equal to 100% of their depositors' accounts. When we give our hat to
the hat-check girl and obtain a receipt for it, we don't expect her to rent
it out while we eat dinner hoping she'll get it back - or one just like it -
in time for our departure.
We expect all the hats to remain there all the
time so there will be no question of getting ours back precisely when we
want it.
On the other hand, if the bank tells us it is going to lend our deposit to
others so we can earn a little interest on it, then it should also tell us
forthrightly that we cannot have our money back on demand. Why not? Because
it is loaned out and not in the vault any longer. Customers who earn
interest on their accounts should be told that they have time deposits, not
demand deposits, because the bank will need a stated amount of time before
it will be able to recover the money which was loaned out.
None of this is difficult to understand, yet bank customers are seldom
informed of it.
They are told they can have their money any time
they want it and they are paid interest as well. Even if they do not receive
interest, the bank does, and this is how so many customer services can be
offered at little or no direct cost. Occasionally, a thirty-day or sixty-day
delay will be mentioned as a possibility, but that is greatly inadequate for
deposits which have been transformed into ten, twenty, or thirty-year loans.
The banks are simply playing the odds that everything will work out most of
the time.
We shall examine this issue in greater detail in a later section but, for
now, it is sufficient to know that total disclosure is not how the banking
game is played. The Federal Reserve System has legalized and
institutionalized the dishonesty of issuing more hat checks than there are
hats and it has devised complex methods of disguising this practice as a
perfectly proper and normal feature of banking.
Students of finance are told that there simply
is no other way for the system to function. Once that premise is accepted,
then all attention can be focused, not on the inherent fraud, but on ways
and means to live with it and make it as painless as possible.
Based on the assumption that only a small percentage of the depositors will
ever want to withdraw their money at the same time, the Federal Reserve
allows the nation's commercial banks to operate with an incredibly thin
layer of cash to cover their promises to pay "on demand." When a bank runs
out of money and is unable to keep that promise, the System then acts as a
lender of last resort.
That is banker language meaning it stands ready
to create money out of nothing and immediately lend it to any bank in
trouble. (Details on how that is accomplished are in chapter eight.)
But there are practical limits to just how far
that process can work. Even the Fed will not support a bank that has gotten
itself so deeply in the hole it has no realistic chance of digging out. When
a bank's bookkeeping assets finally become less than its liabilities, the
rules of the game call for transferring the losses to the depositors
themselves. This means they pay twice: once as taxpayers and again as
depositors.
The mechanism by which this is accomplished is
called the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
THE FDIC PLAY
The FDIC guarantees that every
insured deposit will be paid back regardless of the financial condition of
the bank.
The money to do this comes out of a special fund
which is derived from assessments against participating banks. The banks, of
course, do not pay this assessment. As with all other expenses, the bulk of
the cost ultimately is passed on to their customers in the form of higher
service fees and lower interest rates on deposits.
The FDIC is usually described as an
insurance fund, but that is deceptive advertising at its worst. One of the
primary conditions of insurance is that it must avoid what underwriters call
"moral hazard/' That is a situation in which the policyholder has little
incentive to avoid or prevent that which is being insured against.
When moral hazard is present, it is normal for
people to become careless, and the likelihood increases that what is being
insured against will actually happen. An example would be a government
program forcing everyone to pay an equal amount into a fund to protect them
from the expense of parking fines.
One hesitates even to mention this absurd
proposition lest some enterprising politician should decide to put it on the
ballot.
Therefore, let us hasten to point out that, if
such a numb-skull plan were adopted, two things would happen:
-
just about everyone soon would be
getting parking tickets
-
since there now would be so many of
them, the taxes to pay for those tickets would greatly exceed the
previous cost of paying them without the so-called protection
The FDIC operates exactly in this fashion.
Depositors are told their insured accounts are
protected in the event their bank should become insolvent. To pay for this
protection, each bank is assessed a specified percentage of its total
deposits. That percentage is the same for all banks regardless of their
previous record or how risky their loans. Under such conditions, it does not
pay to be cautious.
The banks making reckless loans earn a higher
rate of interest than those making conservative loans.
They also are far more likely to collect from
the fund, yet they pay not one cent more. Conservative banks are penalized
and gradually become motivated to make more risky loans to keep up with
their competitors and to get their "fair share" of the fund's protection.
Moral hazard, therefore, is built right into the system.
As with protection against parking tickets, the
FDIC increases the likelihood that what is being insured against will
actually happen.
It is not a solution to the problem, it is part
of the problem.
REAL INSURANCE WOULD BE A BLESSING
A true deposit-insurance program which was totally voluntary and which
geared its rates to the actual risks would be a blessing.
Banks with solid loans on their books would be
able to obtain protection for their depositors at reasonable rates, because
the chances of the insurance company having to pay would be small. Banks
with unsound loans, however, would have to pay much higher rates or possibly
would not be able to obtain coverage at any price.
Depositors, therefore, would know instantly,
without need to investigate further, that a bank without insurance is not a
place where they want to put their money. In order to attract deposits,
banks would have to have insurance. In order to have insurance at rates they
could afford, they would have to demonstrate to the insurance company that
their financial affairs are in good order.
Consequently, banks which failed to meet the
minimum standards of sound business practice would soon have no customers
and would be forced out of business. A voluntary, private insurance program
would act as a powerful regulator of the entire banking industry far more
effectively and honestly than any political scheme ever could.
Unfortunately, such is not the banking world of
today.
The FDIC "protection" is not insurance in any sense of the word. It is
merely part of a political scheme to bail out the most influential members
of the banking cartel when they get into financial difficulty.
As we have already seen, the first line of
defense in this scheme is to have large, defaulted loans restored to life by
a Congressional pledge of tax dollars. If that should fail and the bank can
no longer conceal its insolvency through creative bookkeeping, it is almost
certain that anxious depositors will soon line up to withdraw their money -
which the bank does not have.
The second line of defense, therefore, is to
have the FDIC step in and make those payments for them.
Bankers, of course, do not want this to happen. It is a last resort.
If the bank is rescued in this fashion,
management is fired and what is left of the business usually is absorbed by
another bank. Furthermore, the value of the stock will plummet, but this
will affect the small stockholders only. Those with controlling interest and
those in management know long in advance of the pending catastrophe and are
able to sell the bulk of their shares while the price is still high.
The people who create the problem seldom suffer
the economic consequences of their actions.
THE FDIC WILL NEVER BE ADEQUATELY FUNDED
The FDIC never will have enough money to cover its potential liability for
the entire banking system.
If that amount were in existence, it could be
held by the banks themselves, and an insurance fund would not even be
necessary. Instead, the FDIC operates on the same assumption as the banks:
that only a small percentage will ever need money at the same time. So the
amount held in reserve is never more than a few percentage points of the
total liability.
Typically, the FDIC holds about $1.20 for every
$100 of covered deposits. At the time of this writing, however, that figure
had slipped to only 70 cents and was still dropping. That means that the
financial exposure is about 99.3% larger than the safety net which is
supposed to catch it.
The failure of just one or two large banks in
the system could completely wipe out the entire fund.
And it gets even worse. Although the ledger may show that so many millions
or billions are in the fund, that also is but creative bookkeeping. By law,
the money collected from bank assessments must be invested in Treasury
bonds, which means it is loaned to the government and spent immediately by
Congress.
In the final stage of this process, therefore,
the FDIC itself runs out of money and turns, first to the Treasury, then to
Congress for help. This step, of course, is an act of final desperation, but
it is usually presented in the media as though it were a sign of the
system's great strength.
U.S. News & World Report blandly describes it
this way:
"Should the agencies need more money yet,
Congress has pledged the full faith and credit of the federal
government" 1 Gosh, gee whiz.
1. "How Safe Are Deposits in Ailing
Banks, S&L's?" U.S. News & World Report, March 25, 1985, p. 73.
Isn't that wonderful? It sort of makes one feel
rosy all over to know that the fund is so well secured.
Let's see what "full faith and credit of the federal government" actually
means. Congress, already deeply in debt, has no money either. It doesn't
dare openly raise taxes for the shortfall, so it applies for an additional
loan by offering still more Treasury bonds for sale.
The public picks up a portion of these I.O.U.s,
and the Federal Reserve buys the rest. If there is a monetary crisis at hand
and the size of the loan is great, the Fed will pick up the entire issue.
But the Fed has no money either. So it responds by creating out of nothing
an amount of brand new money equal to the I.O.U.s and, through the magic of
central banking, the FDIC is finally funded. This new money gushes into the
banks where it is used to pay off the depositors. From there it floods
through the economy diluting the value of all money and causing prices to
rise.
The old paycheck doesn't buy as much any more,
so we learn to get along with a little bit less. But, see? The bank's doors
are open again, and all the depositors are happy - until they return to
their cars and discover the missing hub caps!
That is what is meant by "the full faith and
credit of the federal government."
SUMMARY
Although national monetary events may appear mysterious and chaotic, they
are governed by well-established rules which bankers and politicians rigidly
follow.
The central fact to understanding these events
is that all the money in the banking system has been created out of nothing
through the process of making loans.
A defaulted loan, therefore, costs the bank
little of tangible value, but it shows up on the ledger as a reduction in
assets without a corresponding reduction in liabilities. If the bad loans
exceed the size of the assets, the bank becomes technically insolvent and
must close its doors. The first rule of survival, therefore, is to avoid
writing off large, bad loans and, if possible, to at least continue
receiving interest payments on them.
To accomplish that, the endangered loans are
rolled over and increased in size.
This provides the borrower with money to
continue paying interest plus fresh funds for new spending. The basic
problem is not solved, but it is postponed for a little while and made
worse.
The final solution on behalf of the banking cartel is to have the federal
government guarantee payment of the loan should the borrower default in the
future. This is accomplished by convincing Congress that not to do so would
result in great damage to the economy and hardship for the people. From that
point forward, the burden of the loan is removed from the bank's ledger and
transferred to the taxpayer. Should this effort fail and the bank be forced
into insolvency, the last resort is to use the FDIC to pay off the
depositors.
The FDIC is not insurance, because the presence
of "moral hazard" makes the thing it supposedly protects against more likely
to happen.
A portion of the FDIC funds are derived from
assessments against the banks. Ultimately, however, they are paid by the
depositors themselves. When these funds run out, the balance is provided by
the Federal Reserve System in the form of freshly created new money.
This floods through the economy causing the
appearance of rising prices but which, in reality, is the lowering of the
value of the dollar. The final cost of the bailout, therefore, is passed to
the public in the form of a hidden tax called inflation.
So much for the rules of the game. In the next chapter we shall look at the
scorecard of the actual play itself.
Chapter Three
PROTECTORS OF THE PUBLIC
The
Game-Called-Bailout as it actually has been applied to
specific cases including,
...and others.
In the previous chapter, we offered the
whimsical analogy of a sporting event to clarify the maneuvers of monetary
and political scientists to bail out those commercial banks which comprise
the Federal-Reserve cartel.
The danger in such an approach is that it could
leave the impression the topic is frivolous. So, let us abandon the analogy
and turn to reality. Now that we have studied the hypothetical rules of the
game, it is time to check the scorecard of the actual play itself, and it
will become obvious that this is no trivial matter.
A good place to start is with the rescue of a
consortium of banks which were holding the endangered loans of Penn Central
Railroad.
PENN CENTRAL
Perm Central was the nation's largest railroad with 96,000 employees and a
payroll of $20 million a week.
In 1970, it also became the nation's biggest
bankruptcy. It was deeply in debt to just about every bank that was willing
to lend it money, and that list included Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty,
Manufacturers Hanover, First National City, Chemical Bank, and Continental
Illinois. Officers of the largest of those banks had been appointed to Penn
Central's board of directors as a condition for obtaining funds, and they
gradually had acquired control over the railroad's Management.
The banks also held large blocks of Penn Central
stock in their trust departments.
The arrangement was convenient in many ways, not the least of which was that
the bankers sitting on the board of directors were privy to information,
long before the public received it, which would affect the market price of
Penn Central's stock.
Chris Welles, in The Last Days of the
Club, describes what happened:
On May 21, a month before the railroad went
under, David Bevan, Penn Central's chief financial officer, privately
informed representatives of the company's banking creditors that its
financial condition was so weak it would have to postpone an attempt to
raise $100 million in desperately needed operating funds through a bond
issue.
Instead, said Bevan, the railroad would seek
some kind of government loan guarantee. In other words, unless the
railroad could manage a federal bailout, it would have to close down.
The following day, Chase Manhattan's trust department sold 134,300
shares of its Perm Central holdings. Before May 28, when the public was
informed of the postponement of the bond issue, Chase sold another
128,000 shares.
David Rockefeller, the bank's chairman,
vigorously denied Chase had acted on the basis of inside information.1
More to the point of this study is the fact that
virtually all of the major management decisions which led to Penn Central's
demise were made by or with the concurrence of its board of directors, which
is to say, by the banks that provided the loans.
In other words, the bankers were not in trouble
because of Penn Central's poor management, they were Penn Central's poor
management. An investigation conducted in 1972 by Congressman Wright Patman,
Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, revealed the
following: The banks provided large loans for disastrous expansion and
diversification projects.
They loaned additional millions to the railroad
so it could pay dividends to its stockholders. This created the false
appearance of prosperity and artificially inflated the market price of its
stock long enough to dump it on the unsuspecting public.
Thus, the banker-managers were able to engineer
a three-way bonanza for themselves.
They,
-
received dividends on essentially
worthless stock
-
earned interest on the loans which
provided the money to pay those dividends
-
were able to unload 1.8 million shares
of stock - after the dividends, of course - at unrealistically high
prices.2

Club (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1975), pp. 398-99.
2. "Penn Central/' 1971 Congressional Quarterly Almanac (Washington, D.C.:
Congressional Quarterly, 1971), p. 838.
Reports from the Securities and Exchange
Commission showed that the company's top executives had disposed of their
stock in this fashion at a personal savings of more than $1 million.1
Had the railroad been allowed to go into bankruptcy at that point and been
forced to sell off its assets, the bankers still would have been protected.
In any liquidation, debtors are paid off first, stockholders last; so the
manipulators had dumped most of their stock while prices were relatively
high.
That is a common practice among corporate
raiders who use borrowed funds to seize control of a company, bleed off its
assets to other enterprises which they also control, and then toss the
debt-ridden, dying carcass upon the remaining stockholders or, in this case,
the taxpayers.
THE PUBLIC BE DAMNED
In his letter of transmittal
accompanying the staff report, Congressman Patman provided this summary:
It was as though everyone was a part of a
close knit club in which Penn Central and its officers could obtain,
with very few questions asked, loans for almost everything they desired
both for the company and for their own personal interests, where the
bankers sitting on the Board asked practically no questions as to what
was going on, simply allowing management to destroy the company, to
invest in questionable activities, and to engage in some cases in
illegal activities.
These banks in return obtained most of the
company's lucrative banking business. The attitude of everyone seemed to
be, while the game was going on, that all these dealings were of benefit
to every member of the club, and the railroad and the public be damned.2
The banking cartel, commonly called the Federal
Reserve System, was created for exactly this kind of bailout. Arthur Burns,
who was the Fed's chairman, would have preferred to provide a direct
infusion of newly created money, but that was contrary to the rules at that
time.
In his own words:
"Everything fell through. We couldn't lend
it to them ourselves under the law... I worked on this thing in other
ways." 3
1- "Penn Central: Bankruptcy Filed
After Loan Bill Fails/' 1970 Congressional Quarterly Almanac (Washington,
D.C.: Congressional Quarterly, 1970), p. 811.
2- Quoted by Welles, pp. 404-05.
3- Quoted by Welles, p. 407.
The company's cash crisis came to a head over a
weekend and, in order to avoid having the corporation forced to file for
bankruptcy on Monday morning.
Burns called the homes of the heads of the
Federal Reserve banks around the country and told them to get the word out
immediately that the System was anxious to help.
On Sunday, William Treiber, who was the first
vice-president of the New York branch of the Fed, contacted the chief
executives of the ten largest banks in New York and told them that the Fed's
Discount Window would be wide open the next morning. Translated, that means
the Federal Reserve System was prepared to create money out of nothing and
then immediately loan it to the commercial banks so they, in turn, could
multiply and re-lend it to Perm Central and other corporations, such as
Chrysler, which were in similar straits.1
Furthermore, the rates at which the Fed would
make these funds available would be low enough to compensate for the risk,
speaking of what transpired on the following Monday, Burns boasted:
"I kept the Board in session practically all
day to change regulation Q so that money could flow into CDs at the
banks."
Looking back at the event, Chris Welles
approvingly describes it as,
"what is by common consent the Fed's finest
hour."
Finest hour or not, the banks were not that
interested in the proposition unless they could be assured the taxpayer
would co-sign the loans and guarantee payment.
So the action inevitably shifted back to
Congress. Perm Central's executives, bankers, and union representatives came
in droves to explain how the railroad's continued existence was in the best
interest of the public, of the working man, of the economic system itself.
The Navy Department spoke of protecting the nation's "defense resources."
Congress, of course, could not callously ignore these pressing needs of the
nation.
It responded by ordering a retroactive, 13½ per
cent pay raise for all union employees. After having added that burden to
the railroad's cash drain and putting it even deeper into the hole, it then
passed the Emergency Rail Services Act of 1970 authorizing $125 million in
federal loan guarantees.3
None of this, of course, solved the basic problem, nor was it really
intended to. Almost everyone knew that, eventually, the railroad would be
"nationalized," which is a euphemism for becoming a black hole into which
tax dollars disappear. This came to pass with the creation of AMTRAK in 1971
and CONRAIL in 1973.
AMTRAK took over the passenger services of Perm
Central, CONRAIL assumed operation of its freight services, along with five
other Eastern railroads. CONRAIL technically is a private corporation. When
it was created, however, 85% of its stock was held by the government.
The remainder was held by employees.
Fortunately, the government's stock was sold in a public offering in 1987.
AMTRAK continues under political control and operates at a loss. It is
sustained by government subsidies - which is to say by taxpayers. In 1997,
Congress dutifully gave it another $5.7 billion and, by 1998, liabilities
exceeded assets by an estimated $14 billion.
CONRAIL, on the other hand, since it was
returned to the private sector, has experienced an impressive turnaround and
has been running at a profit - paying taxes instead of consuming them.
LOCKHEED
In that same year, 1970, the Lockheed Corporation, which was the ration's
largest defense contractor, was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.
The Bank of America and several smaller banks
had loaned $400 million to the Goliath and they were not anxious to lose the
bountiful interest-income stream that flowed from that; nor did they wish to
see such a large bookkeeping asset disappear from their ledgers. In due
course, the banks joined forces with Lockheed's management, stockholders,
and labor unions, and the group descended on Washington.
Sympathetic politicians were told that, if
Lockheed were allowed to fail, 31,000 jobs would be lost, hundreds of sub
contractors would go down, thousands of suppliers would be forced into
bankruptcy, and national security would be seriously jeopardized.
What the company needed was to borrow more money
and lots of it. But, because of its current financial predicament, no one
was willing to lend. The answer? In the interest of protecting the economy
and defending the nation, the government simply had to provide either the
money or the credit.
A bailout plan was quickly engineered by Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally which provided the credit.
The government agreed to guarantee payment on an
additional $250 million in loans - an amount which would put Lockheed 60%
deeper into the debt hole than it had been before. But that made no
difference now. Once the taxpayer had been made a co-signer to the account,
the banks had no qualms about advancing the funds.
The not-so-obvious part of this story is that the government now had a
powerful motivation to make sure Lockheed would be awarded as many defense
contracts as possible and that those contracts would be as profitable as
possible. This would be an indirect method of paying off the banks with tax
dollars, but doing so in such a way as not to arouse public indignation.
Other defense contractors which had operated
more efficiently would lose business, but that could not be proven.
Furthermore, a slight increase in defenses expenditures would hardly be
noticed.
By 1977, Lockheed had, indeed, paid back this loan, and that fact was widely
advertised as proof of the wisdom and skill of all the players, including
the referee and the game commissioner. A deeper analysis, however, must
include two facts.
-
First, there is no evidence that
Lockheed's operation became more cost efficient during these years.
-
Second, every bit of the money used to
pay back the loans came from defense contracts which were awarded by
the same government which was guaranteeing those loans.
Under such an arrangement, it makes little
difference if the loans were paid back or not.
Taxpayers were doomed to pay the bill either
way.
NEW YORK CITY
Although the government of New York City is not a corporation in the usual
sense, it functions as one in many respects, particularly regarding debt.
In 1975, New York had reached the end of its
credit rope and was unable even to make payroll. The cause was not
mysterious. New York had long been a welfare state within itself, and
success in city politics was traditionally achieved by lavish promises of
benefits and subsidies for "the poor."
Not surprisingly, the city also was notorious
for political corruption and bureaucratic fraud. Whereas the average large
city employed thirty-one people per one-thousand residents, New York had
forty nine. That's an excess of fifty-eight per cent. The salaries of these
employees far outstripped those in private industry. While an X-ray
technician in a private hospital earned $187 per week, a porter working for
the city earned $203.
The average bank teller earned $154 per week,
but a change maker on the city subway received $212. And municipal fringe
benefits were fully twice as generous as those in private industry within
the state. On top of this mountainous overhead were heaped additional costs
for free college educations, subsidized housing, free medical care, and
endless varieties of welfare programs.
City taxes were greatly inadequate to cover the cost of this utopia.
Even after transfer payments from Albany and
Washington added state and federal taxes to the take, the outflow continued
to exceed the inflow. There were now only three options: increase city
taxes, reduce expenses, or go into debt. The choice was never in serious
doubt. By 1975, New York had floated so many bonds it had saturated the
market and could find no more lenders.
Two billion dollars of this debt was held by a
small group of banks, dominated by Chase Manhattan and Citicorp.
When the payment of interest on these loans finally came to a halt, it was
time for serious action. The bankers and the city fathers traveled down the
coast to Washington and put their case before Congress. The largest city in
the world could not be allowed to go bankrupt, they said. Essential services
would be halted and millions of people would be without garbage removal,
without transportation, even without police protection.
Starvation, disease, and crime would run rampant
through the city.
It would be a disgrace to America. David
Rockefeller at Chase Manhattan persuaded his friend Helmut Schmidt,
Chancellor of West Germany, to make a statement to the media that the
disastrous situation in New York could trigger an international financial
crisis.
Congress, understandably, did not want to turn New York into a zone of
anarchy, nor to disgrace America, nor to trigger a world-wide financial
panic. So, in December of 1975, it passed a bill authorizing the Treasury to
make direct loans to the city up to $2.3 billion, an amount which would more
than double the size of its current debt to the banks. Interest payments on
the old debt resumed immediately.
All of this money, of course, would first have
to be borrowed by Congress which was, itself, deeply in debt. And most of it
would be created, directly or indirectly, by the Federal Reserve System.
That money would be taken from the taxpayer through the loss of purchasing
power called inflation, but at least the banks could be repaid, which is the
object of the game.
There were several restrictions attached to this loan, including an
austerity program and a systematic repayment schedule. None of these
conditions was honored.
New York City has continued to be a welfare
utopia, and it is unlikely that it will ever get out of debt.
CHRYSLER
By 1978, the Chrysler Corporation was on the verge of bankruptcy.
It had rolled over its debt to the banks many
times, and the game was nearing an end. In spite of an OPEC oil embargo
which had pushed up the cost of gasoline and in spite of the increasing
popularity of small-automobile imports, the company had continued to build
the traditional gas hog. It was now saddled with a mammoth inventory of
unsaleable cars and with a staggering debt which it had acquired to build
those cars.
The timing was doubly bad.
America was also experiencing high interest
rates which, coupled with fears of U.S. military involvement in Cambodia,
had led to a slump in the stock market. Banks felt the credit crunch keenly
and, in one of those rare instances in modern history, the money makers
themselves were scouring for money.
Chrysler needed additional cash to stay in business. It was not interested
in borrowing just enough to pay the interest on its existing loans. To make
the game worth playing, it wanted over a billion dollars in new capital.
But, in the prevailing economic environment, the banks were hard pressed to
create anything close to that kind of money.
Managers, bankers, and union leaders found common cause in Washington. If
one of the largest corporations in America was allowed to fold, think of the
hardship to thousands of employees and their families; consider the damage
to the economy as shock waves of unemployment move across the country;
tremble at the thought of lost competition in the automobile market, of only
two major brands from which to choose instead of three.
Well, could anyone blame Congress for not wanting to plunge innocent
families into poverty nor to upend the national economy nor to deny anyone
their Constitutional right to freedom-of-choice? So a bill was passed
directing the Treasury to guarantee up to $1.5 billion in new loans to
Chrysler.
The banks agreed to write down $600 million of
their old loans and to exchange an additional $700 million for preferred
stock.
Both of these moves were advertised as evidence
the banks were taking a terrible loss but were willing to yield in order to
save the nation. It should be noted, however, that the value of the stock
which was exchanged for previously uncollectable debt rose drastically after
the settlement was announced to the public.
Furthermore, not only did interest payments
resume on the balance of the old loans, but the banks now replaced the
written down portion with fresh loans, and these were far superior in
quality because they were fully guaranteed by the taxpayers. So valuable was
this guarantee that Chrysler, in spite of its previously poor debt
performance, was able to obtain loans at 10.35% interest while its more
solvent competitor, Ford, had to pay 13.5%.
Applying the difference of 3.15% to one
and-a-half billion dollars, with a declining balance continuing for only six
years, produces a savings in excess of $165 million. That is a modest
estimate of the size of the federal subsidy.
The real value was far greater because, without
it, the corporation would have ceased to exist, and the banks would have
taken a loss of almost their entire loan exposure.
FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
It will be recalled from the previous chapter that the FDIC is not a true
insurance program and, because it has been politicized, it embodies the
principle of moral hazard and it actually increases the likelihood that bank
failures will occur.
The FDIC has three options when bailing out an insolvent bank. The first is
called a payoff. It involves simply paying off the insured depositors and
then letting the bank fall to the mercy of the liquidators. This is the
option usually chosen for small banks with no political clout. The second
possibility is called a sell off, and it involves making arrangements for a
larger bank to assume all the real assets and liabilities of the failing
bank.
Banking services are uninterrupted and, aside
from a change in name, most customers are unaware of the transaction. This
option is generally selected for small and medium banks. In both a payoff
and a sell off, the FDIC takes over the bad loans of the failed bank and
supplies the money to pay back the insured depositors.
The third option is called bailout, and this is the one which deserves our
special attention.
Irvine Sprague, a former director of the FDIC,
explains:
"In a bailout, the bank does not close, and
everyone - insured or not - is fully protected... Such privileged
treatment is accorded by FDIC only rarely to an elect few."1
1- Irvine H. Sprague, Bailout: An
Insider's Account ofBank Failures and Rescues (New York: Basic Books, 1986),
p, 23.
That's right, he said everyone - insured or not
- is fully protected.
The banks which comprise the elect few generally
are the large ones. It is only when the number of dollars at risk becomes
mind numbing that a bailout can be camouflaged as protection of the public.
Sprague says:
The FDI Act gives the FDIC board sole
discretion to prevent a bank from failing, at whatever cost. The board
need only make the finding that the insured bank is in danger of failing
and "is essential to provide adequate banking service in its
community"... FDIC boards have been reluctant to make an essentiality
finding unless they perceive a clear and present danger to the nation's
financial system.1
1. Sprague, p. 68.
Favoritism toward the large banks is obvious at
many levels.
One of them is the fact that, in a bailout, the
FDIC covers all deposits, whether insured or not. That is significant,
because the banks pay an assessment based only on their insured deposits.
So, if un insured deposits are covered also, that coverage is free - more
precisely, paid by someone else.
What deposits are uninsured?
Those in excess of $100,000 and those held
outside the United States. Which banks hold the vast majority of such
deposits? The large ones, of course, particularly those with extensive
overseas operations.2 The bottom line is that the large banks get a whopping
free ride when they are bailed out. Their uninsured accounts are paid by
FDIC, and the cost of that benefit is passed to the smaller banks and to the
taxpayer.
This is not an oversight. Part of the plan at
Jekyll Island was to give a competitive edge to the large banks.
UNITY BANK
The first application of the FDIC essentiality rule was, in fact, an
exception.
In 1971, Unity Bank and Trust Company in the
Roxbury section of Boston found itself hopelessly insolvent, and the federal
agency moved in. This is what was found: Unity's capital was depleted; most
of its loans were bad; its loan collection practices were weak; and its
personnel represented the worst of two worlds: overstaffing and
inexperience.
The examiners reported that there were two
persons for every job, and neither one had been taught the job.
With only $11.4 million on its books, the bank was small by current
standards. Normally, the depositors would have been paid back, and the
stockholders - like the owners of any other failed business venture - would
have lost their investment.
As Sprague, himself, admitted:
"If market discipline means anything,
stockholders should be wiped out when a bank fails. Our assistance would
have the side effect... of keeping the stockholders alive at government
expense."1
But Unity Bank was different.
It was located in a black neighborhood and was
minority owned. As is often the case when government agencies are given
discretionary powers, decisions are determined more by political pressures
than by logic or merit, and Unity was a perfect example. In 1971, the
specter of rioting in black communities still haunted the halls of Congress.
Would the FDIC allow this bank to fail and
assume the awesome responsibility for new riots and bloodshed?
Sprague answers:
Neither Wille [another director] nor I had
any trouble viewing the problem in its broader social context. We were
willing to look for a creative solution...
My vote to make the "essentiality" finding
and thus save the little bank was probably foreordained, an inevitable
legacy of Watts... The Watts riots ultimately triggered the essentiality
doctrine.2
1- Sprague, pp. 41-42.
2- ibid, p. 48.
On July 22, 1971, the FDIC declared that the
continued operation of Unity Bank was, indeed, essential and authorized a
direct infusion of $1.5 million.
Although appearing on the agency's ledger as a
loan, no one really expected repayment. In 1976, in spite of the FDIC's own
staff report that the bank's operations continued "as slipshod and haphazard
as ever/' the agency rolled over the "loan" for another five years.
Operations did not improve and, on June 30, 1982, the Massachusetts Banking
Commissioner finally revoked Unity's charter.
There were no riots in the streets, and the FDIC
quietly wrote off the sum of $4,463,000 as the final cost of the bailout.
COMMONWEALTH BANK OF DETROIT
The bailout of the Unity Bank of Boston was the exception to the rule that
small banks are dispensable while the giants must be saved at all costs.
From that point forward, however, the FDIC game
plan was strictly according to Hoyle. The next bailout occurred in 1972
involving the $1.5 billion Bank of the Common-Wealth of Detroit.
Commonwealth had funded most of its phenomenal
growth through loans from another bank, Chase Manhattan in New York.
When Commonwealth went belly up, largely due to
securities speculation and self dealing on the part of its management, Chase
seized 39% of its common stock and actually took control of the bank in an
attempt to find a way to get its money back.
FDIC director Sprague describes the inevitable
sequel:
Chase officers... suggested that
Commonwealth was a public interest problem that the government agencies
should resolve. That unsubtle hint was the way Chase phrased its request
for a bailout by the government... Their proposal would come down to
bailing out the shareholders, the Largest of which was Chase.1
1. Sprague, p. 68.
The bankers argued that Commonwealth must not be
allowed to fold because it provided "essential" banking services to the
community.
That was justified on two counts:
-
it served many minority neighborhoods
-
there were not enough other banks in the
city to absorb its operation without creating an unhealthy
concentration of banking power in the hands of a few
It was unclear what the minority issue had to do
with it inasmuch as every neighborhood in which Commonwealth had a branch
was served by other banks as well.
Furthermore, if Commonwealth were to be
liquidated, many of those branches undoubtedly would have been purchased by
competitors, and service to the communities would have continued. Judging by
the absence of attention given to this issue during discussions, it is
apparent that it was merely thrown in for good measure, and no one took it
very seriously.
In any event, the FDIC did not want to be
accused of being indifferent to the needs of Detroit's minorities and it
certainly did not want to be a destroyer of free-enterprise competition. So,
on January 17,1972, Commonwealth was bailed out with a $60 million loan plus
numerous federal guarantees.
Chase absorbed some losses, primarily as a
result of Commonwealth's weak bond portfolio, but those were minor compared
to what would have been lost without FDIC intervention.
Since continuation of the bank was necessary to prevent concentration of
financial power, FDIC engineered its sale to the First Arabian Corporation,
a Luxembourg firm funded by Saudi princes.
Better to have financial power concentrated in
Saudi Arabia than in Detroit. The bank continued to flounder and, in 1983,
what was left of it was resold to the former Detroit Bank & Trust Company,
now called Comerica.
Thus the dreaded concentration of local power
was realized after all, but not until Chase Manhattan was able to walk away
from the deal with most of its losses covered.
FIRST PENNSYLVANIA BANK
The 1980 bailout of the First Pennsylvania Bank of Philadelphia was next.
First Perm was the nation's twenty-third largest
bank with assets in excess of $9 billion. It was six times the size of
Commonwealth; nine hundred times larger than Unity. It was also the nation's
oldest bank, dating back to the Bank of North America which was created by
the Continental Congress in 1781.
The bank had experienced rapid growth and handsome profits largely due to
the aggressive leadership of its chief executive officer, John Bunting, who
had previously been an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia. Bunting was the epitome of the era's go-go bankers. He vastly
increased earnings ratios by reducing safety margins, taking on risky loans,
and speculating in the bond market.
As long as the economy expanded, these gambles
were profitable, and the stockholders loved him dearly. When his gamble in
the bond market turned sour, however, the bank plunged into a negative cash
flow.
By 1979, First Penn was forced to sell off
several of its profitable subsidiaries in order to obtain operating funds,
and it was carrying $328 million in questionable loans. That was $16 million
more than the entire stockholder investment. The bank was insolvent, and the
time had arrived to hit up the taxpayer for the loss.
The bankers went to Washington and presented their case.
They were joined by spokesmen from the nation's
top three: Bank of America, Citibank, and of course the ever-present Chase
Manhattan.
They argued that, not only was the bailout of
First Penn essential" for the continuation of banking services in
Philadelphia, it was also critical to the preservation of world economic
stability.
The bank was so large, they said, if it were
allowed to fall, it would act as the first domino leading to an
international financial crisis. At first, the directors of the FDIC resisted
that theory and earned the angry impatience of the Federal Reserve.
Sprague recalls:
We were far from a decision on how to
proceed. There was strong pressure from the beginning not to let the
bank fail. Besides hearing from the bank itself, the other large banks,
and the comptroller, we heard frequently from the Fed.
I recall at one session, Fred Schultz, the
Fed deputy chairman, argued in an ever rising voice, that there were no
alternatives - we had to save the bank. He said, "Quit wasting rime
talking about anything else!"...
The Fed's role as lender of last resort first
generated contention between the Fed and FDIC during this period.
The Fed was lending heavily to First
Pennsylvania, fully secured, and Fed Chairman Paul Volcker said he
planned to continue funding indefinitely until we could work out a merger or
a bailout to save the bank.
The directors of the FDIC did not want to cross swords with the Federal
Reserve System, and they most assuredly did not want to be blamed for
tumbling the entire world economic system by allowing the first domino to
fall.
"The theory had never been tested," said
Sprague. "I was not sure I wanted it to be just then." 2
1. Sprague, pp. 88-89.
2. Ibid., p. 89.
So, in due course, a bailout package was put
together which featured a $325 million loan from FDIC, interest free for the
first year and at a subsidized rate thereafter; about half the market rate.
Several other banks which were financially tied
to First Perm, and which would have suffered great losses if it had folded,
loaned an additional $175 million and offered a $1 billion line of credit
FDIC insisted on this move to demonstrate that the banking industry itself
was helping and that it had faith in the venture. To bolster that faith, the
Federal Reserve opened its Discount Window offering low-interest funds for
that purpose.
The outcome of this particular bailout was somewhat happier than with the
others, at least as far as the bank is concerned. At the end of the
five-year taxpayer subsidy, the FDIC loan was fully repaid.
The bank has remained on shaky ground, however,
and the final page of this episode has not yet been written.
CONTINENTAL ILLINOIS
Everything up to this point was but mere practice for the big event which
was yet to come. In the early 1980s, Chicago's Continental Illinois was the
nation's seventh largest bank.
With assets of $42 billion and with 12,000
employees working in offices in almost every major country in the world, its
loan portfolio had undergone spectacular growth. Its net income on loans had
literally doubled in just five years and by 1981 had rocketed to an annual
figure of $254 million. It had become the darling of the market analysts and
even had been named by Dun's Review as one of the five best managed
companies in the country.
These opinion leaders failed to perceive that
the spectacular performance was due, not to an expertise in banking or
investment, but to the financing of shaky business enterprises and foreign
governments which could not obtain loans anywhere else. But the public
didn't know that and wanted in on the action. For awhile, the bank's common
stock actually sold at a premium over others which were more prudently
managed.
The gaudy fabric began to unravel during the Fourth of July weekend of 1982
with the failure of the Perm Square Bank in Oklahoma. That was the notorious
shopping-center bank that had booked a billion dollars in oil and gas loans
and resold them to Continental just before the collapse of the energy market
Other loans also began to sour at the same time.
The Mexican and Argentine debt crisis was coming
to a head, and a series of major corporate bankruptcies were receiving
almost daily headlines. Continental had placed large chunks of its easy
money with all of them. When these events caused the bank's credit raring to
drop, cautious depositors began to withdraw their funds, and new funding
dwindled to a trickle.
The bank became desperate for cash to meet its
daily expenses. In an effort to attract new money, it began to offer
unrealistically high rates of interest on its CDs. Loan officers were sent
to scour the European and Japanese markets and to conduct a public relations
campaign aimed at convincing market managers that the bank was calm and
steady.
David Taylor, the bank's chairman at that
time, said:
"We had the Continental Illinois Reassurance
Brigade and we farmed out all over the world."1
1- Quoted by Chernow, p. 657.
In the fantasy land of modern finance, glitter
is often more important than substance, image more valuable than reality.
The bank paid the usual quarterly dividend in
August, in spite of the fact that this intensified its cash crunch. As with
the Perm Central Railroad twelve years earlier, that move was calculated to
project an image of business-as-usual prosperity.
And the ploy worked - for a while, at least. By
November, the public's confidence had been restored, and the bank's stock
recovered to its pre-Penn Square level. By March of 1983, it had risen even
higher. But the worst was yet to come.
By the end of 1983, the bank's burden of non-performing loans had reached
unbearable proportions and was growing at an alarming rate. By 1984, it was
$2.7 billion. That same year, the bank sold off its profitable credit-card
operation to make up for the loss of income and to obtain money for paying
stockholders their expected quarterly dividend. The internal structure was
near collapse, but the external facade continued to look like business as
usual.
The first crack in that facade appeared at 11:39 A.M.
On Tuesday, May 8, Reuters, the British news
agency, moved a story on its wire service stating that banks in the
Netherlands, West Germany, Switzerland, and Japan had increased their
interest rate on loans to Continental and that some of them had begun to
withdraw their funds. The story also quoted the bank's official statement
that rumors of pending bankruptcy were "totally preposterous."
Within hours, another wire, the Commodity News
Service, reported a second rumor: that a Japanese bank was interested in
buying Continental.
WORLD'S FIRST ELECTRONIC BANK RUN
As the sun rose the following morning, foreign investors began to withdraw
their deposits.
A billion dollars in Asian money moved out that
first day. The next day - a little more than twenty-four hours following
Continental's assurance that bankruptcy was totally preposterous, its
long-standing customer, the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, located
just down the street - withdrew $50 million. Word of the defection spread
through the financial wire services, and the panic was on. It became the
world's first global electronic bank run.
By Friday, the bank had been forced to borrow $3.6 billion from the Federal
Reserve in order to cover its escaping deposits. A consortium of sixteen
banks, lead by Morgan Guaranty, offered a generous thirty-day line of
credit, but all of this was far short of the need. Within seven more days,
the outflow surged to over $6 billion.
In the beginning, almost all of this action was at the institutional level:
other banks and professionally managed funds which closely monitor every
minuscule detail of the financial markets. The general public had no inkling
of the catastrophe, even as it unfolded.
Chernow says:
"The Continental run was like some
modernistic fantasy: there were no throngs of hysterical depositors,
just cool nightmare flashes on computer screens."1
Sprague writes:
"Inside the bank, all was calm, the teller
lines moved as always, and bank officials recall no visible sign of
trouble - except in the wire room- Here the employees knew what was
happening as withdrawal order after order moved on the wire, bleeding
Continental to death. Some cried."2
This was the golden moment for which the Federal
Reserve and the FDIC were created.
Without government intervention, Continental
would have collapsed, its stockholders would have been wiped out, depositors
would have been badly damaged, and the financial world would have learned
that banks, not only have to talk about prudent management, they actually
have to adopt it. Future banking practices would have been severely altered,
and the long-term economic benefit to the nation would have been enormous.
But with government intervention, the discipline
of a free market is suspended, and the cost of failure or fraud is
politically passed to the taxpayers.
Depositors continue to live in a dream world of
false security, and banks can operate recklessly and fraudulently with the
knowledge that their political partners in government will come to their
rescue when they get into trouble.
FDIC GENEROSITY WITH TAX DOLLARS
One of the challenges at Continental was that, while only four per cent of
its liability was covered by FDIC "insurance," the regulators felt compelled
to cover the entire exposure.
Which means that the bank paid insurance
premiums into the fund based on only four per cent of its total coverage,
and the taxpayers now would pick up the other ninety-six per cent.
FDIC director Sprague explains:
Although Continental Illinois had over $30
billion in deposits, 90 percent were uninsured foreign deposits or large
certificates substantially exceeding the $100,000 insurance limit.
Off-book liabilities swelled Continental's
real size to $69 billion. In this massive liability structure only some
$3 billion within the insured limit was scattered among 850,000 deposit
accounts. So it was in our power and entirely legal simply to pay off
the insured depositors, let everything else collapse, and stand back to
watch the carnage.
That course was never seriously considered by
any of the players.
From the beginning, there were only two
questions: how to come to Continental's rescue by covering its total
liabilities and, equally important, how to politically justify such a
fleecing of the taxpayer. As pointed out in the previous chapter, the rules
of the game require that the scam must always be described as a heroic
effort to protect the public.
In the case of Continental, the sheer size of
the numbers made the ploy relatively easy.
There were so many depositors involved, so many
billions at risk, so many other banks interlocked, it could be claimed that
the economic fabric of the entire nation - of the world itself - was at
stake. And who could say that it was not so.
Sprague argues the case in familiar terms:
An early morning meeting was scheduled for
Tuesday, May 15, at the Fed... We talked over the alternatives. They
were few - none really... [Treasury Secretary] Regan and [Fed Chairman]
Volcker raised the familiar concern about a national banking collapse,
that is, a chain reaction if Continental should fail.
Volcker was worried about an international
crisis. We all were acutely aware that never before had a bank even
remotely approaching Continentars size closed. No one knew what might
happen in the nation and in the world. It was no time to find out just
for the purpose of intellectual curiosity.2
1. Sprague, p. 184.
2. Ibid., pp. 154-55,183.
THE FINAL BAILOUT PACKAGE
The bailout was predictable from the start.
There would be some preliminary lip service
given to the necessity of allowing the banks themselves to work out their
own problem. That would be followed by a plan to have the banks and the
government share the burden. And that finally would collapse into a mere
public-relations illusion.
In the end, almost the entire cost of the
bailout would be assumed by the government and passed on to the taxpayer.
At the May 15 meeting, Treasury Secretary Regan
spoke eloquently about the value of a free market and the necessity of
having the banks mount their own rescue plan, at least for a part of the
money.
To work out that plan, a summit meeting was
arranged the next morning among the chairmen of the seven largest banks:
-
Morgan Guaranty
-
Chase Manhattan
-
Citibank
-
Bank of America
-
Chemical Bank
-
Bankers Trust
-
Manufacturers Hanover
The meeting was perfunctory at best.
The bankers knew full well that the Reagan
Administration would not risk the political embarrassment of a major bank
failure. That would make the President and the Congress look bad at
re-election time. But, still, some kind of tokenism was called for to
preserve the Administration's conservative image. So, with urging from the
Fed and the Treasury, the consortium agreed to put up the sum of $500
million - an average of only $71 million for each, far short of the actual
need.
Chernow describes the plan as "make-believe" and
says "they pretended to mount a rescue."1
Sprague supplies the details:
The bankers said they wanted to be in on any
deal, but they did not want to lose any money. They kept asking for
guarantees. They wanted it to look as though they were putting money in
but, at the same time, wanted to be absolutely sure they were not
risking anything...
By 7:30 A.M. we had made little progress. We
were certain the situation would be totally out of control in a few
hours. Continental would soon be exposing itself to a new business day,
and the stock market would open at ten o'clock. Isaac [another FDIC
directorl and I held a hallway conversation.
We agreed to go ahead without the banks. We
told Conover [the third FDIC director] the plan and he concurred...
[Later], we got word from Bernie McKeon, our regional director in New
York, that the bankers had agreed to be at risk. Actually, the risk was
remote since our announcement had promised 100 percent insurance.2
1- Chernow, p. 659.
2- Sprague, pp. 159-60.
The final bailout package was a whopper.
Basically, the government took over Continental
Illinois and assumed all of its losses. Specifically, the FDIC took $4.5
billion in bad loans and paid Continental $35 billion for them. The
difference was then made up by the infusion of $1 billion in fresh capital
in the form of stock purchase. The bank, therefore, now had the federal
government as a stockholder controlling 80 per cent of its shares, and its
bad loans had been dumped onto the taxpayer.
In effect, even though Continental retained the
appearance of a private institution, it had been nationalized.
LENDER OF LAST RESORT
Perhaps the most important part of the bailout, however, was that the money
to make it possible was created - directly or indirectly - by the Federal
Reserve System.
If the bank had been allowed to fail, and the
FDIC had been required to cover the losses, the drain would have emptied the
entire fund with nothing left to cover the liabilities of thousands of other
banks. In other words, this one failure alone, if it were allowed to happen,
would have wiped out the entire FDIC!
That's one reason the bank had to be kept
operating, losses or no losses, and that's why the Fed had to be involved in
the bail out In fact, that was precisely the reason the System was created
at Jekyll Island:
to manufacture whatever amount of money
might be necessary to cover the losses of the cartel.
The scam could never work unless the Fed was
able to create money out of nothing and pump it into the banks along with
"credit" and "liquidity" guarantees.
Which means, if the loans go sour, the money is
eventually extracted from the American people through the hidden tax called
inflation. That's the meaning of the phrase "lender of last resort."
FDIC director Irvine Sprague, while discussing the press release which
announced the Continental bail-out package, describes the Fed's role this
way:
The third paragraph... granted 100 percent
insurance to all depositors, including the uninsured, and all general
creditors... The next paragraph... set forth the conditions under which
the Fed, as lender of last resort, would make its loans... The Fed would
lend to Continental to meet "any extraordinary liquidity requirements."
That would include another run. All agreed
that Continental could not be saved without 100 percent insurance by
FDIC and unlimited liquidity support by the Federal Reserve. No plan
would work without these two elements.1
1. Sprague, pp. 162-63.
By 1984, "unlimited liquidity support" had translated into the staggering
sum of $8 billion. By early 1986, the figure had climbed to $9.24 billion
and was still rising.
While explaining this fleecing of the taxpayer
to the Senate Banking Committee, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker said:
"The operation is the most basic function of
the Federal Reserve. It was why it was founded." 1
With those words, he has confirmed one of the
more controversial assertions of this book.
SMALL BANKS BE DAMNED
It has been mentioned previously that the large banks receive a free ride on
their FDIC coverage at the expense of the small banks.
There could be no better example of this than
the bail out of Continental Illinois. In 1983, the bank paid a premium into
the fund of only $6.5 million to protect its insured deposits of $3 billion.
The actual liability, however - including its institutional and overseas
deposits - was ten times that figure, and the FDIC guaranteed payment on the
whole amount.
As Sprague admitted,
"Small banks pay proportionately far more
for their insurance and have far less chance of a Continental-style
bailout" 2
How true.
Within the same week that the FDIC and the Fed
were providing billions in payments, stock purchases, loans, and guarantees
for Continental Illinois, it closed down the tiny Bledsoe County Bank of
Pikeville, Tennessee, and the Planters Trust and Savings Bank of Opelousas,
Louisiana. During the first half of that year, forty-three smaller banks
failed without an FDIC bailout.
In most cases, a merger was arranged with a
larger bank, and only the uninsured deposits were at risk. The impact of
this inequity upon the banking system is enormous. It sends a message to
bankers and depositors alike that small banks, if they get into trouble,
will be allowed to fold, whereas large banks are safe regardless of how
poorly or fraudulently they are managed.
As a New York investment analyst stated to news
reporters, Continental Illinois, even though it had just failed, was,
"obviously the safest bank in the country to
have your money in." 3
1- Quoted by Greider, p. 628.
2- Sprague, p.250.
3- New Continental Illinois Facing Uncertain Future/' by Keith E. Leighty,
Associated Press, Thousand Oaks, Calif., News Chronicle, May 13, 1985, p.
18.
Nothing could be better calculated to drive the
small independent banks out of business or to force them to sell out to the
giants.
And that, in fact, is exactly what has been
happening. Since 1984, while hundreds of small banks have been forced out of
business, the average size of the banks which remain - with government
protection - has more than doubled. It will be recalled that this advantage
of the big banks over their smaller competitors was also one of the
objectives of the Jekyll Island plan.
Perhaps the most interesting - and depressing - aspect of the Continental
Illinois bailout was the lack of public indignation over the principle of
using taxes and inflation to protect the banking industry. Smaller banks
have complained of the unfair advantage given to the larger banks, but not
on the basis that the government should have let the giant fall.
Their lament was that it should now protect them
in the same paternalistic fashion. Voters and politicians were silent on the
issue, apparently awed by the sheer size of the numbers and the specter of
economic chaos. Decades of public education had left their mark. After all,
wasn't this exactly what government schools have taught is the proper
function of government? Wasn't this the American way?
Even Ronald Reagan, viewed as the national
champion of economic conservatism, praised the action.
From aboard Air Force One on the way to
California, the President said:
"It was a thing that we should do and we did
it. It was in the best interest of all concerned."1
The Reagan endorsement brought into focus one of
the most amazing phenomena of the 20th century:
the process by which America has moved to
the Left toward statism while marching behind the political banner of
those who speak the language of opposing statism.
William Greider, a former writer for the
liberal Washington Post and The Rolling Stone, complains:
The nationalization of Continental was, in
fact, a quintessential act of modem liberalism - the state intervening
in behalf of private interests and a broad public purpose. In this
supposedly conservative era, federal authorities were setting aside the
harsh verdict of market competition (and grossly expanding their own
involvement in the private economy)....
In the past, conservative scholars and pundits
had objected loudly at any federal intervention in the private economy,
particularly emergency assistance for failing companies.
Now, they hardly seemed to notice. Perhaps they
would have been more vocal if the deed had been done by someone other than
the conservative champion, Ronald Reagan.2
1. "Reagan Calls Rescue of Bank
No Bailout/' New York Times, July 29,1984.
2. Greider, p. 631.
Four years after the bailout of Continental Illinois, the same play was used
in the rescue of BankOklahoma, which was a bank holding company.
The FDIC pumped $130 million into its main
banking unit and took warrants for 55% ownership. The pattern had been set.
By accepting stock in a failing bank in return for bailing it out, the
government had devised an ingenious way to nationalize banks without calling
it that. Issuing stock sounds like a business transaction in the private
sector.
And the public didn't seem to notice the reality
that Uncle Sam was going into banking.
SECOND REASON TO ABOLISH THE FEDERAL RESERVE
A sober evaluation of this long and continuing record leads to the second
reason for abolishing the Federal Reserve System: Far from being a protector
of the public, it is a cartel operating against the public interest.
SUMMARY
The game called bailout is not a whimsical figment of the imagination, it is
for real.
Here are some of the big games of the season and
their final scores.
In 1970, Perm Central railroad became bankrupt. The banks which loaned the
money had taken over its board of directors and had driven it further into
the hole, all the while extending bigger and bigger loans to cover the
losses.
Directors concealed reality from the
stockholders and made additional loans so the company could pay dividends to
keep up the false front. During this time, the directors and their banks
unloaded their stock at unrealistically high prices. When the truth became
public, the stockholders were left holding the empty bag.
The bailout, which was engineered by the Federal
Reserve, involved government subsidies to other banks to grant additional
loans.
Then Congress was told that the collapse of Perm
Central would be devastating to the public interest. Congress responded by
granting $125 million in loan guarantees so that banks would not be at risk.
The railroad eventually failed anyway, but the bank loans were covered. Perm
Central was nationalized into AMTRAK and continues to operate at a loss.
i In 1970, as Lockheed faced bankruptcy, Congress heard essentially the same
story. Thousands would be unemployed, subcontractors would go out of
business, and the public would suffer greatly. So Congress agreed to
guarantee $250 million in new loans, which put Lockheed 60% deeper into debt
than before. Now that government was guaranteeing the loans, it had to make
sure Lockheed became profitable.
This was accomplished by granting lucrative
defense contracts at non-competitive bids. The banks were paid back.
In 1975, New York City had reached the end of its credit rope. It had
borrowed heavily to maintain an extravagant bureaucracy and a miniature
welfare state. Congress was told that the public would be jeopardized if
city services were curtailed, and that America would be disgraced in the
eyes of the world. So Congress authorized additional direct loans up to $2.3
billion, which more than doubled the size of the current debt. The banks
continued to receive their interest.
In 1978, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy. Congress was informed that
the public would suffer greatly if the company folded, and that it would be
a blow to the American way if freedom-of-choice were reduced from three to
two makes of automobiles. So Congress guaranteed up to $1.5 billion in new
loans. The banks reduced part of their loans and exchanged another portion
for preferred stock.
News of the deal pushed up the market value of
that stock and largely offset the loan write-off. The banks' previously
uncollectable debt was converted into a government-backed, interest-bearing
asset.
In 1972, the Commonwealth Bank of Detroit - with $1.5 billion in assets,
became insolvent. It had borrowed heavily from the Chase Manhattan Bank in
New York to invest in high-risk and potentially high-profit ventures. Now
that it was in trouble, so was Chase. The bankers went to Washington and
told the FDIC the public must be protected from the great financial hardship
that would follow if Commonwealth were allowed to close.
So the FDIC pumped in a $60 million loan plus
federal guarantees of repayment. Commonwealth was sold to an Arab
consortium. Chase took a minor write down but converted most of its
potential loss into government-backed assets.
In 1979, the First Pennsylvania Bank of Philadelphia became insolvent. With
assets in excess of $9 billion, it was nine-times the size of Commonwealth.
It, too, had been an aggressive player in the '80s. Now the bankers and the
Federal Reserve told the FDIC that the public must be protected from the
calamity of a bank failure of this size, that the national economy was at
stake, perhaps even the entire world.
So the FDIC gave a $325 million loan -
interest-free for the first year, and at half the market rate thereafter.
The Federal Reserve offered money to other banks at a subsidized rate for
the specific purpose of relending to First Perm. With that enticement, they
advanced $175 million in immediate loans plus a $1 billion line of credit.
In 1982, Chicago's Continental Illinois became insolvent. It was the
nation's seventh largest bank with $42 billion in assets.
The previous year, its profits had soared as a
result of loans to high-risk business ventures and foreign governments.
Although it had been the darling of market analysts, it quickly unraveled
when its cash flow turned negative, and overseas banks began to withdraw
deposits. It was the world's first electronic bank run.
Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker told the FDIC
that it would be unthinkable to allow the world economy to be ruined by a
bank failure of this magnitude. So, the FDIC assumed $4.5 billion in bad
loans and, in return for the bailout, took 80% ownership of the bank in the
form of stock. In effect, the bank was nationalized, but no one called it
that. The United States government was now in the banking business.
All of the money to accomplish these bailouts was made possible by the
Federal Reserve System acting as the "lender of last resort." That was one
of the purposes for which it had been created.
We must not forget that the phrase "lender of
last resort" means that the money is created out of nothing, resulting in
the confiscation of our nation s wealth through the hidden tax called
inflation.
Chapter Four
HOME, SWEET LOAN
The history of increasing
government intervention in the housing industry; the
stifling of free-market forces in residential real
estate; the resulting crisis in the S&L industry; the
bailout of that industry with money taken from the
taxpayer.
As we have seen in previous chapters, the damage
done by the banking cartel is made possible by the fact that money can be
created out of nothing. It also destroys our purchasing power through the
hidden tax called inflation.
The mechanism by which it works is hidden and
subtle.
Let us turn, now, from the arcane world of central banking to the giddy
world of savings-and-loan institutions. By comparison, the problem in the
savings-and-loan industry is easy to comprehend. It is simply that vast
amounts of money are disappearing into the black hole of government
mismanagement, and the losses must eventually be paid by us.
The end result is the same in both cases.
SOCIALISM TAKES ROOT IN AMERICA
It all began with a concept. The concept took root in America largely as a
result of the Great Depression of the 1930s.
American politicians were impressed at how
radical Marxists were able to attract popular support by blaming the
capitalist system for the country's woes and by promising a socialist
Utopia. They admired and feared these radicals; admired them for their skill
at mass psychology; feared them lest they become so popular as to win a
plurality at the ballot box.
It was not long before many political figures
began to mimic the soap-box orators, and the voters enthusiastically put
them into office.
While the extreme and violent aspects of Communism generally were rejected,
the more genteel theories of socialism became Popular among the educated
elite. It was they who would naturally become the leaders in an American
socialist system Someone had to look after the masses and tell them what to
do for their own good, and many with college degrees and those with great
wealth became enamored by the thought of playing that role.
And so, the concept became widely accepted at
all levels of American life - the "downtrodden masses" as well as the
educated elite - that it was desirable for the government to take care of
its citizens and to protect them in their economic affairs.
And so, when more than 1900 S&Ls went belly-up in the Great Depression,
Herbert Hoover - and a most willing Congress - created the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board to protect depositors in the future. It began to issue charters
to institutions that would submit to its regulations, and the public was led
to believe that government regulators would be more wise, prudent, and
honest than private managers.
A federal charter became a kind of government
seal of approval. The public, at last, was being protected.
Hoover was succeeded by FDR in the White House who became the epitome of the
new breed. Earlier in his political career, he had been the paragon of free
enterprise and individualism. He spoke out against big government and for
the free market, but in mid life he reset his sail to catch the shifting
political wind. He went down in history as a pioneer of socialism in
America.
It was FDR who took the next step toward government paternalism in the S&L
industry - as well as the banking industry - by establishing the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Saving and Loan
Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). From that point forward, neither the
public nor the managers of the thrifts needed to worry about losses.
Everything would be reimbursed by the
government.
A HOUSE ON EVERY LOT
At about the same time, loans on private homes became subsidized through the
Federal Housing Authority (FHA) which allowed S&Ls to make loans at
rates lower than would have been possible without the subsidy.
This was to make it easier for everyone to
realize the dream of having their own home. While the Marxists were
promising a chicken in every pot, the New Dealers were winning elections by
pushing for a house on every lot.
In the beginning, many people were able to purchase a home who, otherwise,
might not have been able to do so or who would have had to wait longer to
accumulate a higher down payment. On the other hand, the FHA-induced easy
credit began to push up the price of houses for the middle class, and that
quickly offset any real advantage of the subsidy.
The voters, however, were not perceptive enough
to understand this canceling effect and continued to vote for politicians
who promised to expand the system.
The next step was for the Federal Reserve Board to require banks to offer
interest rates lower than those offered by S&Ls. The result was that funds
moved from the banks into the S&Ls and became abundantly available for home
loans. This was a deliberate national policy to favor the home industry at
the expense of other industries that were competing for the same investment
dollars.
It may not have been good for the economy as a
whole but it was good politics.
ABANDONMENT OF THE FREE MARKET
These measures effectively removed real estate loans from the free market
and placed them into the political arena, where they have remained ever
since.
The damage to the public as a result of this
intervention would be delayed a long time in coming, but when it came, it
would be cataclysmic.
The reality of government disruption of the free market cannot be
overemphasized, for it is at the heart of our present and future crisis. We
have savings institutions that are controlled by government at every step of
the way. Federal agencies provide protection against losses and lay down
rigid guidelines for capitalization levels, number of branches, territories
covered, management policies, services rendered, and interest rates charged.
The additional cost to S&Ls of compliance with
this regulation has been estimated by the American Bankers Association at
about $11 billion per year, which represents a whopping 60% of all their
profits.
On top of that, the healthy component of the industry must spend over a
billion dollars each year for extra premiums into the so-called insurance
fund to make up for the failures of the unhealthy component, a form of
penalty for success. When some of the healthy institutions attempted to
convert to banks to escape this Penalty, the regulators said no.
Their cash flow was needed to support the
bailout fund.
INSURANCE FOR THE COMMON MAN?
The average private savings deposit is
about $6,000.
Yet, under the Carter administration, the level
of FDIC insurance was raised from $40,000 to $100,000 for each account.
Those with more than that merely had to open several accounts, so, in
reality, the sky was the limit. Clearly this had nothing to do with
protecting the common man. The purpose was to prepare the way for brokerage
houses to reinvest huge blocks of capital at high rates of interest
virtually without risk.
It was, after all, insured by the federal
government.
In 1979, Federal Reserve policy had pushed up interest rates, and the S&Ls
had to keep pace to attract deposits. By December of 1980, they were paying
15.8% interest on their money-market certificates. Yet, the average rate
they were charging for new mortgages was only 12.9%. Many of their older
loans were still crunching away at 7 or 8% and, to compound the problem,
some of those were in default, which means they were really paying 0%. The
thrifts were operating deep in the red and had to make up the difference
somewhere.
The weakest S&Ls paid the highest interest rates to attract depositors and
they are the ones which obtained the large blocks of brokered funds. Brokers
no longer cared how weak the operation was, because the funds were fully
insured. They just cared about the interest rate.
On the other hand, the S&L managers reasoned that they had to make those
funds work miracles for the short period they had them. It was their only
chance to dig out, and they were willing to take big risks. For them also,
the government's insurance program had removed any chance of loss to their
depositors, so many of them plunged into high-profit, high-risk real-estate
developments.
Deals began to go sour, and 1979 was the first year since the Great
Depression of the 1930s that the total net worth of federally insured S&Ls
became negative. And that was despite expansion almost everywhere else in
the economy.
The public began to worry.
FULL FAITH AND CREDIT
The protectors in Washington
responded in 1982 with a joint resolution of Congress declaring that the
full faith & credit of the United States government stood behind the FSLIC.
That was a reassuring phrase, but many people
had the gnawing feeling that, somehow, we were going to pay for it
ourselves. And they were right.
Consumer Reports explained:
Behind the troubled banks and the
increasingly troubled insurance agencies stands "the full faith and
credit" of the Government - in effect, a promise, sure to be honored by
Congress, that all citizens will chip in through taxes or through
inflation to make all depositors whole.
The plight of the S&Ls was dramatically brought
to light in Ohio in 1985 when the Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati
collapsed as a result of a potential $150 million loss in a Florida
securities firm.
This triggered a run, not only on the
thirty-three branches of Home State, but on many of the other S&Ls as well.
The news impacted international markets where overseas speculators dumped
paper dollars for other currencies, and some rushed to buy gold.
Within a few days, depositors demanding their money caused $60 million to
flow out of the state's $130 million "insurance" fund which, true to form
for all government protection schemes, was terribly inadequate. If the run
had been allowed to continue, the fund likely would have been obliterated
the next day. It was time for a political fix.
Chi March 15, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste declared one of the few "bank
holidays" since the Great Depression and closed all seventy-one of the
state-insured thrifts. He assured the public there was nothing to worry
about.
He said this was merely a,
"cooling-off period... until we can
convincingly demonstrate the soundness of our system."
Then he flew to Washington and met with Paul
Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and with Edwin Gray,
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to request federal assistance.
They assured him it was available.
A few days later, depositors were authorized to withdraw up to $750 from
their accounts. On March 21, President Reagan calmed the world money markets
with assurances that the crisis was over. Furthermore, he said, the problem
was "limited to Ohio." 2

This was not the first time there had been a
failure of state-sponsored insurance funds. The one in Nebraska was pulled
down ^ 1983 when the Commonwealth Savings Company of Lincoln failed. It had
over $60 million in deposits, but the insurance fund had less than $2
million to cover, not just Commonwealth, but the whole system.
Depositors were lucky to get 65 cents on the
dollar, and even that was expected to take up to 10 years.1

Banks, S&Ls?/' U.S. 'News & World Report, March 25, 1985, p. 74.
AN INVITATION TO FRAUD
In the early days of the Reagan administration, government regulations were
changed so that the S&Ls were no longer restricted to the issuance of home
mortgages, the sole reason for their creation in the first place.
In fact, they no longer even were required to
obtain a down payment on their loans. They could now finance 100% of a deal
- or even more. Office buildings and shopping centers sprang up everywhere
regardless of the need. Developers, builders, managers, and appraisers made
millions. The field soon became overbuilt and riddled with fraud.
Billions of dollars disappeared into defunct
projects. In at least twenty-two of the failed S&Ls, there is evidence that
the Mafia and CIA were involved.
Fraud is not necessarily against the law. In fact, most of the fraud in the
S&L saga was, not only legal, it was encouraged by the government. The
Garn-St Germain Act allowed the thrifts to lend an amount of money equal to
the appraised value of real estate rather than the market value. It wasn't
long before appraisers were receiving handsome fees for appraisals that
were, to say the least, unrealistic.
But that was not fraud, it was the intent of the
regulators. The amount by which the appraisal exceeded the market value was
defined as "appraised equity" and was counted the same as capital. Since the
S&Ls were required to have $1 in capital for every $33 held in deposits, an
appraisal that exceeded market value by $1 million could be used to pyramid
$33 million in deposits from Wall Street brokerage houses.
And the anticipated profits from those funds was
one of the ways in which the S&Ls were supposed to recoup their losses
without the government having to cough up the money - which it didn't have.
In effect the government was saying:
"We can't make good on our protection
scheme, so go get the money yourself by putting the investors at risk.
Not only will we back you up if you fail, we'll show you exactly how to
do it."
THE FALLOUT BEGINS
In spite of the accounting gimmicks which were created to make the
walking-dead S&Ls look healthy, by 1984 the fallout began.
The FSLIC closed one institution that year and
arranged for the merger of twenty-six others which were insolvent. In order
to persuade healthy firms to absorb insolvent ones, the government provides
cash settlements to compensate for the liabilities. By 1984, these
subsidized mergers were costing the FDIC over $1 billion per year. Yet, that
was just the small beginning.
Between 1980 and 1986, a total of 664 insured S&Ls failed. Government
regulators had promised to protect the public in the event of losses, but
the losses were already far beyond what they could handle. They could not
afford to close down all the insolvent thrifts because they simply didn't
have enough money to cover the pay out. In March of 1986, the FSLIC had only
3 cents for every dollar of deposits.
By the end of that year, the figure had dropped
to two-tenths of a penny for each dollar "insured." Obviously, they had to
keep those thrifts in business, which meant they had to invent even more
accounting gimmicks to conceal the reality.
Postponement of the inevitable made matters even worse. Keeping the S&Ls in
business was costing the FSLIC $6 million per day.1
1- Fizzling FSLIC" by Shirley Hobbs
Scheibla, Barron's, Feb. 9, 1987, p. 16.
By 1988, two years later, the thrift industry as
a whole was losing $9.8 million per day, and the unprofitable ones - the
corpses which were propped up by the FSLIC - were losing $35.6 million per
day. And, still, the game continued.
By 1989, the FSLIC no longer had even two-tenths of a penny for each dollar
insured. Its reserves had vanished altogether.
Like the thrifts it supposedly protected, it
was, itself, insolvent and looking for loans. It had tried offering bond
issues, but these fell far short of its needs. Congress had discussed the
problem but had failed to provide new funding. The collapse of Lincoln
Savings brought the crisis to a head.
There was no money, period.
THE FED USURPS THE ROLE OF CONGRESS
In February, an agreement was reached between Alan Greenspan, Chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, and M. Danny Wall, Chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, to have $70 million of bailout funding for Lincoln
Savings come directly from the Federal Reserve.
This was a major break in precedent. Historically, the Fed has served to
create money only for the government or for banks.
If it were the will of the people to bail out a
savings institution, then it is up to Congress to approve the funding. If
Congress does not have the money or cannot borrow it from the public, then
the Fed can create it (out of nothing, of course) and give it to the
government. But, in this instance, the Fed was usurping the role of Congress
and making political decisions entirely on its own.
There is no basis in the Federal Reserve Act for
this action. Yet, Congress remained silent, apparently out of collective
guilt for its own paralysis.
Finally, in August of that year, Congress was visited by the ghost of FDR
and sprang into action. It passed the Financial Institutions Reform and
Recovery Act (FIRREA) and allocated a minimum of $66 billion for the
following ten years, $300 billion over thirty years. Of this amount, $225
billion was to come from taxes or inflation, and $75 billion was to come
from the healthy S&Ls. It was the biggest bailout ever, bigger than the
combined cost for Lockheed, Chrysler, Perm Central, and New York City.
In the process, the FSLIC was eliminated because it was hopelessly insolvent
and replaced by the Savings Association Insurance Fund. Also created was the
Banking Insurance Fund for the protection of commercial banks, and both are
now administered by the FDIC.
As is often the case when previous government control fails to produce the
desired result, the response of Congress is to increase the controls.
Four entirely new layers of bureaucracy were
added to the existing tangled mess:
-
the Resolution Trust Oversight Board, to
establish strategies for the RTC
-
the Resolution Funding Corporation, to
raise money to operate the RTC
-
the Office of Thrift Supervision, to
supervise thrift institutions even more than they had been
-
the Oversight Board for the Home Loan
Banks, the purpose of which remains vague but probably is to make
sure that the S&Ls continue to serve the political directive of
subsidizing the home industry
When President Bush signed the bill, he said:
This legislation will safeguard and
stabilize America's financial system and put in place permanent reforms
so these problems will never happen again. Moreover, it says to tens of
millions of savings-and-loan depositors, "You will not be the victim of
others' mistakes. We will see - guarantee - that your insured deposits
are secure." 1
1- "Review of the News," The New
American, Sept. 11,1989, p. 15.
THE ESTIMATES ARE SLIGHTLY WRONG
By the middle of the following year, it was clear that the $66 billion
funding would be greatly inadequate.
Treasury spokesmen were now quoting $130
billion, about twice the original estimate. How much is $130 billion? In
1990, it was 30% more than the salaries of all the schoolteachers in
America. It was more than the combined profits of all the Fortune-500
industrial companies. It would send 1.6 million students through the best
four-year colleges, including room and board.
And the figure did not even include the cost of
liquidating the huge backlog of thrifts already seized nor the interest that
had to be paid on borrowed funds. Within only a few days of the announced
increase, the Treasury again revised the figure upward from $130 billion to
$150 billion.
As Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told the
press,
"No one should assume that the estimates
won't change. They will."
Indeed, the estimates continued to change with
each passing week.
The government had sold or merged 223 insolvent
thrifts during 1988 and had given grossly inadequate estimates of the cost.
Financiers such as Ronald Perelman and the Texas investment partnership
called Temple-Inland, Inc., picked up many of these at fantastic bargains,
especially considering that they were given cash subsidies and tax
advantages to sweeten the deal.
At the time, Danny Wall, who was then Chairman
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, announced that these deals "took care"
of the worst thrift problems. He said the cost of the bailout was $39
billion.
The Wall Street Journal replied:
Wrong again. The new study, a compilation of
audits prepared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, indicates
that the total cost of the so-called Class of '88 will be $90 billion to
$95 billion, including tax benefits granted the buyers and a huge amount
of interest on government debt to help finance this assistance...
But the 1988 thrift rescues' most expensive flaw
doesn't appear to be the enrichment of tycoons.
Rather it's that none of the deals ended or even
limited the government's exposure to mismanagement by the new owners, hidden
losses on real estate in the past, or the vicissitudes of the real-estate
markets in the future... And some of the deals appear to be sham
transactions, in which failing thrifts were sold to failing thrifts, which
are failing all over again...
Although the thrifts proved to be in far worse shape than the Bank Board
estimated, Mr. Wall defends his strategy for rescuing them with open-ended
assistance.
"We didn't have the money to liquidate," he
says.1
When Congress passed FIRREA the previous year to
"safeguard and stabilize America's financial system," the staggering sum of
$300 billion dollars was authorized to be taken from taxes and inflation
over the following thirty years to do the job.
Now, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was
saying that the true long-term cost would stand at $500 billion, an amount
even greater than the default of loans to all the Third-World countries
combined.
The figure was still too low. A non-biased
private study released by Veribank, Inc. showed that, when all the hidden
costs are included, the bill presented to the American people will be about
$532 billion.2
The problems that President Bush promised would
"never happen again" were happening again.
BOOKKEEPING SLEIGHT OF HAND
Long before this point, the real estate market had begun to contract, and
many mortgages exceeded the actual price for which the property could be
sold.
Furthermore, market interest rates had risen far
above the rates that were locked into most of the S&L loans, and that
decreased the value of those mortgages. The true value of a $50,000 mortgage
that is paying 7% interest is only half of a $50,000 mortgage that is
earning 14%. So the protectors of the public devised a scheme whereby the
S&Ls were allowed to value their assets according to the original loan value
rather than their true market value.
That helped, but much more was still needed.
The next step was to create bookkeeping assets out of thin air. This was
accomplished by authorizing the S&Ls to place a monetary value on community
"good will"!
With the mere stroke of a pen, the referees
created $2.5 billion in such assets, and the players continued the game.
Then the FSLIC began to issue "certificates of net worth," which were
basically promises to bail out the ailing S&Ls should they need it- The
government had already promised to do that but, by printing it on pieces of
paper and calling them "certificates of net worth," the S&Ls were allowed to
count them as assets on their books.
Such promises are assets but, since the thrifts
would be obligated to pay back any money it received in a bailout, those
pay-back obligations should also have been put on the books as liabilities.
The net position would not change. The only way they could count the
certificates as assets without adding the offsetting liabilities would be
for the bailout promises to be outright gifts with no obligation to ever
repay.
That may be the eventual result, but it is not
the way the plan was set up. In any event, the thrifts were told they could
count these pieces of paper as capital, the same as if the owners had put up
their own cash. And the game continued.
The moment of truth arrives when the S&Ls have to liquidate some of their
holdings, such as in the sale of their mortgages or foreclosed homes to
other S&Ls, commercial banks, or private parties. That is when the inflated
bookkeeping value is converted into the true market value, and the
difference has to be entered into the ledger as a loss.
But not in the never-never land of socialism
where government is the great protector.
Dennis Turner explains:
The FSLIC permits the S&L which sold the
mortgage to take the loss over a 40-year period. Most companies selling
an asset at a loss must take the loss immediately: only S&Ls can engage
in this patent fraud. Two failing S&Ls could conceivably sell their
lowest-yielding mortgages to one another, and both would raise their net
worth! This dishonest accounting in the banking system is approved by
the highest regulatory authorities.1
U.S. News & World Report continues the
commentary:
Today, scores of savings-and-loan
associations, kept alive mainly by accounting girnmicks, continue to
post big losses... Only a fraction of the industry's aggregate net worth
comprises hard assets such as mortgage notes. Intangible assets, which
include bookkeeping entries such as good will, make up nearly all of the
industry's estimated net worth of 37.6 billion dollars.2

ACCOUNTING GIMMICKS ARE NOT FRAUD
We must keep in mind that a well managed institution would never assume
these kinds of risks or resort to fraudulent accounting if it wanted to stay
in business for the long haul.
But with Washington setting guidelines and
standing by to make up losses, a manager would be fired if he didn't take
advantage of the opportunity. After all, Congress specifically said it was
OK when it passed the laws. These were loopholes deliberately put there to
be used.
Dr. Edward Kane explains:
Deception itself doesn't constitute illegal
fraud when it's authorized by an accounting system such as the Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) system which allows institutions
to forego recording assets at their true worth, maintaining them instead
at their inflated value. The regulatory accounting principles system in
1982 added even new options to overstate capital...
Intense speculation, such as we observed in
these firms, is not necessarily bad management at all. In most of these
cases, it was clever management. There were clever gambles that
exploited, not depositors or savers, but taxpayers.1
The press has greatly exaggerated the role of
illegal fraud in these matters with much time spent excoriating the likes of
Donald Dixon at Vernon S&L and Charles Keating at Lincoln Savings.
True, these flops cost the taxpayer well over $3
billion dollars, but all the illegal fraud put together amounts to only
about one-half of one per cent of the total losses so far.2
Focusing on that minuscule component serves only
to distract from the fact that the real problem is government regulation
itself.

JUNK BONDS ARE NOT JUNK
Another part of the distraction has been to make it appear that the thrifts
got into trouble because they were heavily invested in "junk bonds."
Wait a minute! What are junk bonds, anyway? This
may come as a surprise, but those held by the S&Ls were anything but junk.
In fact, in terms of risk-return ratios, most of them were superior-grade
investments to bonds from the Fortune-500 companies-so-called junk bonds are
merely those that are offered by smaller companies which are not large
enough to be counted among the nation's giants.
The large reinvestors, such as managers of
mutual funds and retirement funds, prefer to stay with well-known names like
General Motors and IBM.
They need to invest truly huge blocks of money
every day, and the smaller companies just don't have enough to offer to
satisfy their needs. Consequently, many stocks and bonds from smaller
companies are not traded in the New York Stock Exchange. They are traded in
smaller exchanges or directly between brokers in what is called "over the
counter."
Because they do not have the advantage of being
traded in the larger markets, they have to pay a higher interest rate to
attract investors, and for that reason, they are commonly called high-yield
bonds.
Bonds offered by these companies are derided by some brokers as not being
"investment grade," yet, many of them are excellent performers. In fact,
they have become an important part of the American economy because they are
the backbone of new industry. The most successful companies of the future
will be found among their ranks. During the last decade, while the
Fortune-500 companies were shrinking and eliminating 3.6 million jobs, this
segment of new industry has been growing and has created 18 million new
jobs.
Not all new companies are good investments - the same is true of older
companies - but the small-company sector generally provides more jobs, has
greater profit margins, and pays more dividends than the so-called
"investment-grade" companies.
From 1981 to 1991, the average return on
ten-year Treasury bills was 10.4 per cent; the Dow Jones Industrial Average
was 12.9 per cent; and the average return on so-called junk bonds was 14.1
per cent. Because of this higher yield, they attracted more than $180
billion from savvy investors, some of whom were S&Ls.
It was basically a new market which was
orchestrated by an upstart, Michael Milken, at the California-based Drexel
Burnham Lambert brokerage house.
CAPITAL GROWTH WITHOUT BANK LOANS OR INFLATION
One of the major concerns at Jekyll Island in 1910 was the trend to obtain
business-growth capital from sources other than bank loans.
Here, seventy years later, the same trend was
developing again in a slightly different form. Capital, especially for small
companies, was now coming from bonds which Drexel had found a way to mass
market. In fact, Drexel was even able to use those bonds to engineer
corporate takeovers, an activity that previously had been reserved for the
mega-investment houses.
By 1986, Drexel had become the most profitable
investment bank in the country.
Here was $180 billion that no longer was being channeled through Wall
Street. Here was $180 billion that was coming from people's savings instead
of being created out of nothing by the banks. In other words, here was
growth built upon real investment, not inflation. Certain people were not
happy about it.
Glenn Yago, Director of the Economic
Research Bureau and Associate Professor of Management at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, explains the problem:
It was not until high yield securities were
applied to restructuring through deconglomeration and takeovers that
hostilities against the junk bond market broke out... The high yield
market grew at the expense of bank debt, and high yield companies grew
at the expense of the hegemony of many established firms.
As Peter Passell noted in The New York
Times, the impact was first felt on Wall Street, "where sharp elbows and
a working knowledge of computer spreadsheets suddenly counted more than
a nose for dry sherry or membership in
Skull and Bones."1
1. Glenn Yago, Junk Bonds: How High
Yield Securities Restructured Corporate America (New York: Oxford University
Press, 1991), p. 5.
The first line of attack on this new market of
high-yield bonds was to call them "junk." The word itself was powerful. The
financial media picked it up and many investors were frightened away.
The next step was for compliant politicians to pass a law requiring S&Ls to
get rid of their "junk," supposedly to protect the public. That this was a
hoax is evident by the fact that only 5% ever held any of these bonds, and
their holdings represented only 1.2% of the total S&Ls assets.
Furthermore, the bonds were performing
satisfactorily and were a source of much needed revenue. Nevertheless, The
Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery Act, which was discussed
previously, was passed in 1989. It forced S&Ls to liquidate at once their
"junk" bond holdings. That caused their prices to plummet, and the thrifts
were even further weakened as [hey took a loss on the sale.
Jane Ingraham comments:
Overnight, profitable S&Ls were turned into
government-owned basket cases in the hands of the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC). To add to the disaster, the RTC itself, which became
the country's largest owner of junk bonds... flooded the market again
with $1.6 billion of its holdings at the market's bottom in 1990...
So it was government itself that crashed the
junk bond market, not Michael Milken, although the jailed Milken and
other former officials of Drexel Burnham Lambert have just agreed to a
$1.3 billion settlement of the hundreds of lawsuits brought against them
by government regulators, aggrieved investors, and others demanding
"justice." 1
Incidentally, these bonds have since recovered
and, had the S&Ls been allowed to keep them, they would be in better
financial condition today. And so would be the RTC.
With the California upstarts out of the way, it was a simple matter to buy
up the detested bonds at bargain prices and to bring control of the new
market back to Wall Street.
The New York firm of Salomon Brothers, for
example, one of Drexel's most severe critics during the 1980s, is now a
leading trader in the market Drexel created.
REAL PROBLEM IS GOVERNMENT REGULATION
So the real problem within the savings-and-loan industry is government
regulation which has insulated it from the free market and encouraged it to
embark upon unsound business practices. As the Wall Street Journal stated on
March 10,1992:
If you're going to wreck a business the size
of the U.S. Thrift industry, you need a lot more power than Michael
Milken ever had. You need the power of national political authority, the
kind of power possessed only by regulators and Congress. Whatever "hold"
Milken or junk bonds may have had on the S&Ls, it was nothing compared
with the interventions of Congress.2
1- "Banking on Government," pp.
24,25.
2- Quoted in "Banking on Government," p. 26.
At the time this book went to press, the number of S&Ls that operated during
the 1980s had dropped to less than half. As failures, mergers, and
conversion into banks continue, the number will decline further.
Those that remain fall into two groups: those
that have been taken over by the RTC and those that have not Most of those
that remain under private control - and that is a relative term in view of
the regulations they endure - are slowly returning to a healthy state as a
result of improved profitability, asset quality, and capitalization.
The RTC-run organizations, on the other hand,
continue to hemorrhage due to failure by Congress to provide funding to
close them down and pay them off. Losses from this group are adding $6
billion per year to the ultimate cost of bailout. President Clinton was
asking Congress for an additional $45 billion and hinting that this should
be the last bailout - but no promises.
The game continues.
CONGRESS IS PARALYZED, WITH GOOD REASON
Congress seems disinterested and paralyzed with inaction.
One would normally expect dozens of politicians
to be calling for a large-scale investigation of the ongoing disaster, but
there is hardly a peep. The reason becomes obvious when one realizes that
savings-and-loan associations, banks, and other federally regulated
institutions are heavy contributors to the election campaigns of those who
write the regulatory laws.
A thorough, public investigation would
undoubtedly turn up some cozy relationships that the legislators would just
as soon keep confidential.
The second reason is that any honest inquiry would soon reveal the shocking
truth that Congress itself is the primary cause of the problem. By following
the socialist path and presuming to protect or benefit their constituency,
they have suspended and violated the natural laws that drive a free-market
economy. In so doing, they created a Frankenstein monster they could not
control The more they tried to tame the thing, the more destructive it
became.
As economist Hans Sennholz has observed:
The real cause of the disaster is the very
financial structure that was fashioned by legislators and guided by
regulators; they together created a cartel that, like all other
monopolistic concoctions, is playing mischief with its victims.1
A CARTEL WITHIN A CARTEL
Sennholz has chosen exactly the right word: cartel.
The savings-and-loan industry, is really a
cartel within a cartel. It could not function without Congress standing by
to push unlimited amounts 0f money into it. And Congress could not do that
without the banking cartel called the Federal Reserve System standing by as
the "lender of last resort" to create money out of nothing for Congress to
borrow.
This comfortable arrangement between political
scientists and monetary scientists permits Congress to vote for any scheme
it wants, regardless of the cost. If politicians tried to raise that money
through taxes, they would be thrown out of office. But being able to
"borrow" it from the Federal Reserve System upon demand, allows them to
collect it through the hidden mechanism of inflation, and not one voter in a
hundred will complain.
The thrifts have become the illegitimate half-breed children of the
Creature. And that is why the savings-and-loan story is included in this
study.
If America is to survive as a free nation, her citizens must become far more
politically educated than they are at present. As a people, we must learn
not to reach for every political carrot dangled in front of us. As desirable
as it may be for everyone to afford a home, we must understand that
government programs pretending to make that possible actually wreak havoc
with our system and bring about just the opposite of what they promise.
After 60 years of subsidizing and regulating the
housing industry, how many young people today can afford a home?
Tinkering with the laws of supply and demand,
plus the hidden tax called inflation to pay for the tinkering, has driven
prices beyond the reach of many and has wiped out the down payments of
others.
Without such costs, common people would have
much more money and purchasing power than they do today, and homes would be
well within their reach.
SUMMARY
Our present-day problems within the savings-and-loan industry can be traced
back to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Americans were becoming impressed by the
theories of socialism and soon embraced the concept that it was proper for
government to provide benefits for its citizens and to protect them against
economic hardship.
Under the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations, new government agencies were
established which purported to protect deposits in the S&Ls and to subsidize
home mortgages for the middle class. These measures distorted the laws of
supply and demand and, from that point forward, the housing industry was
moved out of the free market and into the political arena.
Once the pattern of government intervention had been established, there
began a long, unbroken series of federal rules and regulations that were the
source of windfall profits for managers, appraiser, brokers, developers, and
builders. They also weakened the industry by encouraging unsound business
practices and high-risk investments.
When these ventures failed, and when the value of real estate began to drop,
many S&Ls became insolvent. The federal insurance fund was soon depleted,
and the government was confronted with its own promise to bail out these
companies but not having any money to do so.
The response of the regulators was to create accounting gimmicks whereby
insolvent thrifts could be made to appear solvent and, thus, continue in
business. This postponed the inevitable and made matters considerably worse.
The failed S&Ls continued to lose billions of dollars each month and added
greatly to the ultimate cost of bailout, all of which would eventually have
to be paid by the common man out of taxes and inflation. The ultimate cost
is estimated at over one trillion dollars.
Congress appears to be unable to act and is strangely silent. This is
understandable. Many representatives and senators are the beneficiaries of
generous donations from the S&Ls. But perhaps the main reason is that
Congress, itself, is the main culprit in this crime. In either case, the
politicians would like to talk about something else.
In the larger view, the S&L industry is a cartel within a cartel.
The fiasco could never have happened without the
cartel called the Federal Reserve System standing by to create the vast
amounts of bailout money pledged by Congress.
Chapter Five
NEARER TO THE HEART'S DESIRE
The 1944 meeting in Bret ton
Woods, New Hampshire, at which the world's most prominent
socialists established the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank as mechanisms for eliminating gold from world
finance; the hidden agenda behind the IMF/World Bank
revealed as the building of world socialism; the role of the
Federal Reserve in bringing that about.
As we have seen, the game called Bailout has
been played over and over again in the rescue of large corporations,
domestic banks, and savings-and-loan institutions.
The pretense has been that these measures were
necessary to protect the public. The result, however, has been just the
opposite. The public has been exploited as billions of dollars have been
expropriated through taxes and inflation. The money has been used to make up
losses that should have been paid by the failing banks and corporations as
the penalty for mismanagement and fraud.
While this was happening in our home-town stadium, the same game was being
played in the international arena. There are two primary differences. One is
that the amount of money at stake in the international game is much larger.
Through a complex tangle of bank loans,
subsidies, and grants, the Federal Reserve is becoming the "lender of last
resort" for virtually the entire planet.
The other difference is that, instead of
claiming to be Protectors of the Public, the players have emblazoned across
the backs of their uniforms: Saviors of the World.
BRETTON WOODS: AN ATTACK ON GOLD
The game began at an international meeting of financiers, Politicians, and
theoreticians held in July of 1944 at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton
Woods, New Hampshire.
Officially, it was called the United Nations
Monetary and Financial Conference, but is generally referred to today as
simply the Bretton Woods Conference. Two international agencies were created
at that meeting: the International Monetary Fund and its sister
organization, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development -
commonly called the World Bank.
The announced purposes of these organizations were admirable. The World Bank
was to make loans to war-torn and underdeveloped nations so they could build
stronger economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was to promote
monetary cooperation between nations by maintaining fixed exchange rates
between their currencies.
But the method by which these goals were to be
achieved was less admirable. It was to terminate the use of gold as the
basis of international currency exchange and replace it with a politically
manipulated paper standard. In other words, it was to allow governments to
escape the discipline of gold so they could create money out of nothing
without paying the penalty of having their currencies drop in value on world
markets.
Prior to this conference, currencies were exchanged in terms of their gold
value, and the arrangement was called the "gold-exchange standard."
This is not the same as a "gold-standard" in
which a currency is backed by gold. It was merely that the exchange ratios
of the various currencies - most of which were not backed by gold - were
determined by how much gold they could buy in the open market. Their values,
therefore, were set by supply and demand.
Politicians and bankers hated the arrangement,
because it was beyond their ability to manipulate. In the past, it had
served as a remarkably efficient mechanism but it was a strict
disciplinarian.
As John Kenneth Galbraith observed:
The Bretton Woods arrangements sought to
recapture the advantages of the gold standard - currencies that were
exchangeable at stable and predictable rates into gold and thus at
stable and predictable rates into each other. And this it sought to
accomplish while minimizing the pain imposed by the gold standard on
countries that were buying too much, selling too little and thus losing
gold."
The method by which this was to be accomplished
was exactly the method devised on Jekyll Island to allow American banks to
create money out of nothing without paying the penalty of having their
currencies devalued by other banks.
It was the establishment of a world central bank
which would create a common fiat money for all nations and then require them
to inflate together at the same rate. There was to be a kind of
international insurance fund which would rush that fiat money to any nation
that temporarily needed it to face down a "run" on its currency. It wasn't
born with all these features fully developed, just as the Federal Reserve
wasn't fully developed when it was born.
That, nevertheless, was the plan, and it was
launched with all the structures in place.
The theoreticians who drafted this plan were the well-known Fabian Socialist
from England, John Maynard Keynes,1 and the Assistant
Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Harry Dexter White.
1- Keynes often is portrayed as having
been merely a liberal. But, for his Lifelong involvement with Fabians and
their work, see Rose Martin, Fabian Freeway; High Road to Socialism in the
U.S.A. (Boston: Western Islands, 1966).
THE FABIAN SOCIETY
The Fabians were an elite group of intellectuals who formed a semi-secret
society for the purpose of bringing socialism to the world.
Whereas Communists wanted to establish socialism
quickly through violence and revolution, the Fabians preferred to do it
slowly through propaganda and legislation. The word socialism was not to be
used. Instead, they would speak of benefits for the people such as welfare,
medical care, higher wages, and better working conditions. In this way, they
planned to accomplish their objective without bloodshed and even without
serious opposition.
They scorned the Communists, not because they
disliked their goals, but because they disagreed with their methods. To
emphasize the importance of gradualism, they adopted the turtle as the
symbol of their movement. The three most prominent leaders in the early days
were Sidney and Beatrice Webb and George Bernard Shaw.
A stained-glass window in the Beatrice Webb
House in Surrey, England is especially enlightening.
Across the top appears the last line from Omar
Khayyam:
Dear love, couldst thou and I with fate
conspire
To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire,
Would we not shatter it to bits, and then
Remould it nearer to the heart's desire!
Beneath the line Remould it nearer to the
heart's desire, the mural depicts Shaw and Webb striking the earth with
hammers.
Across the bottom, the masses kneel in worship
of a stack of books advocating the theories of socialism. Thumbing his nose
at the docile masses is H.G. Wells who, after quitting the Fabians,
denounced them as "the new machiavellians."
The most revealing component, however, is the
Fabian crest which appears Between Shaw and Webb, It is a wolf in sheep's
clothing!1
COMMUNIST MOLES
Harry Dexter White was America's
chief technical expert and the dominant force at the conference.
He eventually became the first Executive
Director for the United States at the IMF. An interesting footnote to this
story is that White was simultaneously a member of the
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and a member of a Communist
espionage ring in Washington while he served as Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury.
And even more interesting is that the White
House was informed of that fact when President Truman appointed him to his
post.
The FBI had transmitted to the White House
detailed proof of White's activities on at least two separate occasions.2
Serving as the technical secretary at the Bretton Woods conference was
Virginius Frank Coe, a member of the same espionage ring to which White
belonged. Coe later became the first Secretary of the IMF.
Thus, completely hidden from public view, there was a complex drama taking
place in which the intellectual guiding lights at the Bretton Woods
conference were Fabian Socialists and Communists. Although they were in
disagreement over method, they were in perfect harmony on goal:
international socialism.
There were undoubtedly other reasons for
Communists to be enthusiastic about the IMF and the World Bank, despite the
fact that the Soviet Union elected at the time not to become a member. The
goal of the organizations was to create a world currency, a world central
bank, and a mechanism to control the economies of all nations.
In order for these things to happen, the United
States would of necessity have to surrender its dominant position.
In fact, it would have to be reduced to just one
part of the collective whole. That fit in quite nicely with the Soviet plan.
Furthermore, the World Bank was seen as a vehicle for moving capital from
the United States and other industrialized nations to the underdeveloped
nations, the very ones over which Marxists have always had the greatest
control.
They looked forward to the day when we would pay
their bills. It has all come to pass.
IMF STRUCTURE AND FUNDING
The International Monetary Fund appears to be a part of the United Nations,
much as the Federal Reserve System appears to be a part of the United States
government, but it is entirely independent.
It is funded on a quota basis by its member
nations, almost two hundred in number. The greatest share of capital,
however, comes from the more highly industrialized nations such as Great
Britain, Japan, France, and Germany, The United States contributes the most,
at about twenty per cent of the total. In reality, that twenty per cent
represents about twice as much as the number indicates, because most of the
other nations contribute worthless currencies which no one wants.
The world prefers dollars.
One of the routine operations at the IMF is to exchange worthless currencies
for dollars so the weaker countries can pay their international bills. This
is supposed to cover temporary "cash-flow" problems. It is a kind of
international FDIC which rushes money to a country that has gone bankrupt so
it can avoid devaluing its currency. The transactions are seldom paid back.
Although escape from the gold-exchange standard was the long-range goal of
the IMF, the only way to convince nations to participate at the outset was
to use gold itself as a backing for its own money supply - at least as a
temporary expedient.
As Keynes explained it:
I felt that the leading central banks would
never voluntarily relinquish the then existing forms of the gold
standard; and I did not desire a catastrophe sufficiently violent to
shake them off involuntarily.
The only practical hope lay, therefore, in a
gradual evolution in the forms of a managed world currency, taking the
existing gold standard as a starting point.1
It was illegal for American citizens to own gold
at that time, but everyone else in the world could exchange their paper
dollars for gold at a fixed price of $35 per ounce.
That made it the de facto international currency
because, unlike any other at the time, its value was guaranteed. So, at the
outset, the IMF adopted the dollar as its own international monetary unit.
PAPER GOLD
But the Fabian turtle was crawling inexorably toward its destination. In
1970, the IMF created a new monetary unit called the SDR, or Special Drawing
Right.
The media optimistically described it as "paper
gold," but it was pure bookkeeping wizardry with no relationship to gold or
anything else of tangible value. SDRs are based on "credits" which are
provided by the member nations. These credits are not money.
They are merely promises that the governments
will get the money by taxing their own citizens should the need arise. The
IMF considers these to be "assets" which then become the "reserves" from
which loans are made to other governments. As we shall see in chapter ten,
this is almost identical to the bookkeeping sleight-of-hand that is used to
create money out of nothing at the Federal Reserve System.
Dennis Turner cuts through the garbage:
SDRs are turned into loans to Third-World
nations by the creation of checking accounts in the commercial or
central banks of the member nations in the name of the debtor
governments. These bank accounts are created out of thin air.
The IMF creates dollars, francs, pounds, or
other hard currencies and gives them to a Third-World dictator, with
inflation resulting in the country where the currency originated.,..
Inflation is caused in the industrialized nations while wealth is
transferred from the general public to the debtor country. And the
debtor doesn't repay.
When the IMF was created, it was the vision of
Fabian Socialist John Maynard Keynes that there be a world central bank
issuing a reserve currency called the "bancor" to free all governments from
[he discipline of gold.
With the creation of SDRs, the IMF had finally
begun to fulfill that dream.
GOLD IS FINALLY ABANDONED
But there was still an obstacle.
As long as the dollar was the primary currency
used by the IMF and as long as it was redeemable in gold at $35 per ounce,
the amount of international money that could be created would be limited. If
the IMF were to function as a true world central bank with unlimited issue,
the dollar had to be broken away from its gold backing as a first step
toward replacing it completely with a bancor, an SDR or something else
equally free from restraint.
On August 15,1971, President Nixon signed an executive order declaring that
the United States would no longer redeem its paper dollars for gold. So
ended the first phase of the IMF's metamorphosis. It was not yet a true
central bank, because it could not create its own world currency.
It had to depend on the central banks of its
member nations to provide cash and so-called credits; but since these banks,
themselves, could create as much money as they wished, from now on, there
would be no limit.
The original purpose had been to maintain fixed rates of exchange between
currencies; but the IMF has presided over more than two hundred currency
devaluations. In private industry, a failure of that magnitude might be
cause for going out of business, but not in the world of politics. The
greater the failure, the greater the pressure to expand the program.
So, when the dollar broke loose from gold and
there was no longer a ready standard for measuring currency values, the IMF
merely changed its goal and continued to expand its operation.
The new goal was to "overcome trade deficits."
TRADE DEFICITS
The topic of trade deficits is a favorite among politicians, economists, and
talk-show hosts. Everyone agrees they are bad, but th^re is much
disagreement over what causes them. Let7s have a try at it.
A trade deficit is a condition that exists when a country imports a greater
value of goods than it exports. In other words, it spends m°re than it earns
in international trade. This is similar to the situation of an individual
who spends more than he earns.
In both cases, the process cannot be sustained
unless:
-
earnings are increased
-
money is taken out of savings
-
assets are sold
-
money is counterfeited
-
money is borrowed
Unless one of these occurs, the individual or
the country has no choice but to decrease spending.
Increasing one's earnings is the best solution. In fact, it is the only
solution for the long haul. All else is temporary at best. An individual can
increase his income by working harder or smarter or longer. A country does
it the same way. But it cannot happen unless private industry is allowed to
flourish in a system of free-enterprise.
The problem with this option is that few
politicians respect the dynamic power of the free-enterprise system. Their
world is built upon political programs in which the laws of the free market
are manipulated to achieve politically popular goals. They may desire the
option of increasing the nation's income by increasing its productivity, but
their political agenda prevents that from happening.1
The second option is to obtain extra money out of savings. But there are
virtually no governments in the world today that have any savings. Their
debts and liabilities exceed assets by a large margin. Likewise, most of
their industries and their citizens are in a similar position. Their savings
already have been consumed by government.
The third option, the selling of assets, also is not available for most
countries. By assets, we mean tangible items other than merchandise which is
normally for sale. Although these, too, are assets in the broad meaning, in
accounting methodology, they are classified as inventory. The only
government asset that is readily marketable is gold, and few countries today
have a stockpile from which to draw. Even in those cases, what little they
have is already owed to another government or a bank.
As for private assets, nations can, for a while,
sell these to foreign buyers and offset their negative trade balances.
That is what has been happening in the United
States for many years as office buildings, stocks, factories, and entire
companies have been sold to foreign investors. But the fact remains that the
nation is still spending more than it earns, and that process cannot
continue indefinitely. Foreign ownership and control over industry and
commerce also create sociological and political problems.
Underdeveloped countries do not have to worry
about any of that, however, because they have few private assets to sell.
THE COUNTERFEIT OPTION
The counterfeit option is available only if a country happens to be in the
unique position of having its currency accepted as the medium of
international trade, as has been the case for the United States.
In that event, it is possible to create money
out of nothing, and other nations have no choice but to accept it. Thus, for
years, the United States has been able to spend more money than it earned in
trade by having the Federal Reserve create whatever it needed.
When the dollar was separated entirely from gold in 1971, it ceased being
the official IMF world currency and finally had to compete with other
currencies - primarily the mark and the yen - on the basis of its relative
merit. From that point forward, its value increasingly became discounted.
Nevertheless, it was still the preferred medium of exchange.
Also, the U.S. was one of the safest places in
the world to invest one's money. But, to do so, one first had to convert his
native currency into dollars. These facts gave the U.S. dollar greater value
on international markets than it otherwise would have merited.
So, in spite of the fact that the Federal
Reserve was creating huge amounts of money during this time, the demand for
it by foreigners was seemingly limitless. The result is that America has
continued to finance its trade deficit with fiat money - counterfeit, if you
will - a feat which no other nation in the world could hope to accomplish.
We have been told that our nation's trade deficit is a terrible thing, and
that it would be better to "weaken the dollar" to bring it to an end.
Weakening the dollar is a euphemism for
increasing Ration. In truth, America is not hurt by a trade deficit at all.
In ' We are the benefactors while our trading partners are the victims. We
get the cars and TV sets while they get the funny money.
We get the hardware. They get the paperware.
There is a dark side to the exchange, however. As long as the dollar remains
in high esteem as a trade currency, America can continue to spend more than
it earns. But when the day arrives - as it certainly must - when the dollar
tumbles and foreigners no longer want it, the free ride will be over. When
that happens, hundreds of billions of dollars that are now resting in
foreign countries will quickly come back to our shores as people everywhere
in the world attempt to convert them into yet more real estate, factories,
and tangible products, and to do so as quickly as possible before they
become even more worthless.
As this flood of dollars bids up prices, we will
finally experience the inflation that should have been caused in years past
but which was postponed because foreigners were kind enough to take the
dollars out of our economy in exchange for their products.
The chickens will come home to roost. But, when they do, it will not be
because of the trade deficit. It will be because we were able to finance the
trade deficit with fiat money created by the Federal Reserve. If it were not
for that, the trade deficit could not have happened.
Back to the main topic, which is the five methods by which a trade deficit
can be paid. Through the process of elimination, the fourth option of
borrowing is where the action is today for most of the world, and that is
where the IMF positioned itself in 1970.
Its new mission was to provide loans so
countries can continue to spend more than they earn, but to do so in the
name of "overcoming trade deficits."
IMF LOANS: DOOMED BUT SWEET
These loans do not go into private
enterprises where they have a chance of being turned for a profit.
They go into state-owned and state-operated
industries which are constipated by bureaucracy and poisoned by corruption.
Doomed to economic failure from the start, they consume the loans with no
possibility of repayment Even the interest quickly becomes too much to
handle. Which means the IMF must fall back to the "reserves," back to the
"assets," back to the "credits," and eventually back to the taxpayers to
bail them out.
Whereas the International Monetary Fund is evolving into a world central
bank which eventually will issue a world currency based on nothing, its
sister organization, the World Bank, has become its lending agency.
Acting as Savior of the World, it seeks to aid
the underdeveloped nations, to feed the hungry, and to bring a better life
to all mankind. In pursuit of these humanitarian goals, it provides loans to
governments at favorable terms, usually at rates below market, for terms as
long as fifty years, and often with no payments due until after ten years.
Funding for these loans comes from member states in the form of a small
amount of cash, plus promises to deliver about ten-times more if the Bank
gets into trouble. The promises, described as "callable capital," constitute
a kind of FDIC insurance program but with no pretense at maintaining a
reserve fund.
(In that sense it is more honest than the real
FDIC which does maintain the pretense but, in reality, is based on nothing
more than a similar promise.)
Based upon the small amount of seed money plus the far greater amount of
"credits" and "promises" from governments of the industrialized countries,
the World Bank is able to go into the commercial loan markets and borrow
larger sums at extremely low interest rates. After all, the loans are backed
by the most powerful governments in the world which have promised to force
their taxpayers to make the payments if the Bank should get into trouble.
It then takes these funds and relends them to
the underdeveloped countries at slightly higher rates, making a profit on
the arbitrage.
The unseen aspect of this operation is that the money it processes is money
which, otherwise, would have been available for investment in the private
sector or as loans to consumers. It siphons off much-needed development
capital for private industry, prevents new jobs from being created, causes
interest rates to rise, retards the economy at large.
THE HIDDEN AGENDA: WORLD SOCIALISM
Although most of the policy statements of the World Bank deal with economic
issues, a close monitoring of its activities reveal a preoccupation with
social and political issues.
This should not be surprising considering that
the Bank was perceived by its founders as an instrument for social and
political change. The change which it was designed to bring about was the
building of world socialism, ^d that is exactly what it is accomplishing
today.
This hidden agenda becomes crystal clear in the nature of what the Bank
calls Sectoral Loans and Structural-Adjustment Loans.
In the first category, only part of the money is
to be used for the costs of specific projects while the rest goes to support
policy changes in the economic sector. In the second group, all of the money
is for policy changes and none of it is for projects. In recent years,
almost half of the loans to underdeveloped countries have been in that
category. What are the policy changes that are the object of these loans?
They add up to one thing: the building of world socialism.
As the Fabians had planned it, the word socialism is not to be used.
Instead, the loans are issued for government
hydro-electric projects, government oil refineries, government lumber mills,
government mining companies, and government steel plants. It is delivered
from the hands of politicians and bureaucrats into the hands of other
politicians and bureaucrats. When the money comes from government, goes to
government, and is administered by government, the result will be the
expansion of government.
Here is an example. One of the policy changes often required by the World
Bank as a condition of granting a loan is that the recipient country must
hold down its wages. The assumption is that the government has the power -
and rightfully should have the power - to set wages! In other words, one of
the conditions of its loan is that the state must be omnipotent.
Paul Roberts holds the William E. Simon Chair of Political Economy at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Writing in Business Week, he says:
The entire "development process" has been
guided by the belief that reliance on private enterprise and equity
investment is incompatible with economic and social progress. In place
of such proven avenues of success, development planning substituted
loans and foreign aid so that governments of the LDCs [Less Developed
Countries] could control economic activity in keeping with plans drawn
up by experts.
Consequently, economic life in the LDCs was
politicized from the start. By endowing governments with extensive
control over their economies, the U.S. set up conditions exactly
opposite to those required for economic growth.1
Ken Ewert explains further that the
conditions imposed by the fund are seldom free-market oriented.
He says:
The Fund concentrates on "macro-policies/'
such as fiscal and monetary policies or exchange rates, and pays little
attention to fundamental issues like private property rights and freedom
of enterprise.
Implicit... is the belief that with proper
"macro-management" any economic system is viable...
Even more important, it has allowed governments the world over to
expropriate the wealth of their citizens more efficiently (through the
hidden tax of inflation) while at the same time aggrandizing their own
power. There is little doubt that the IMF is an influence for world-wide
socialism.1
1- "The International Monetary Fund" by
Ken S. Ewert, The Freeman, April, 1989, p 157, 158.
An important feature of the
Structural-Adjustment Loans is that the money need not be applied to any
specific development project. It can be spent for anything the recipient
wishes. That includes interest payments on overdue bank loans.
Thus, the World Bank becomes yet one more
conduit from the pockets of taxpayers to the assets of commercial banks
which have made risky loans to Third-World countries.
AUSTERITY MEASURES AND SCAPEGOATS
Not every measure advocated by the IMF and World Bank is socialistic.
Some of them even appear to be in support of the
private sector, such as the reduction of government subsidies and welfare.
They may include tax increases to reduce budget deficits. These policy
changes are often described in the press as "austerity measures" and they
are seen as hard-nosed business decisions to salvage the failing economies
of underdeveloped countries.
But, as the wolf (in sheep's clothing) said to
Little Red-Riding-Hood,
"All the better to fool you with, my dear."
These austerity measures are mostly rhetoric.
The borrowing nations usually ignore the conditions with impunity, and the
World Bank keeps the money coming anyway. It's all part of the game.
Nevertheless, the "structural-adjustment" conditions provide a scapegoat for
local politicians who can now place the blame for their nation's misery on
big, bad "capitalists" from America and the IMF.
People who have been taught that it is
government's role to provide for their welfare, their health care, their
food and housing, their jobs and retirement - such people will not be happy
when they hear that these "rights" are being threatened.
So they demonstrate in the streets in protest,
they riot in the commercial sections of town so they can steal goods from
stores, and they throng to the banner of leftist politicians who promise to
restore or increase their benefits.
As described by Insight magazine:
National strikes, riots, political upheavals
and social unrest in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, Haiti,
Liberia, Peru, Sudan and elsewhere have at various times been attributed
to IMF austerity programs...
Some came to the fund with domestic trouble already brewing and seized
on the fund as a convenient scapegoat.1
Quite true.
An honest reading of the record shows that the
IMF, far from being a force for austerity in these countries, has been an
engine of socialist waste and a fountain of abundance for the corrupt
leaders who rule.
FINANCING CORRUPTION AND DESPOTISM
Nowhere is this pattern more blatant than in Africa.
Julius Nyerere, the dictator of Tanzania, is
notorious for his "villagization" program in which the army has driven the
peasants from their land, burned their huts, and loaded them like cattle
into trucks for relocation into government villages.
The purpose is to eliminate opposition by
bringing everyone into compounds where they can be watched and controlled.
Meanwhile the economy staggers, farms have gone to weed, and hunger is
commonplace. Yet, Tanzania has received more aid per capita from the World
Bank than any other nation.
In Uganda, government security forces have engaged in mass detentions,
torture, and killing of prisoners. The same is true under the terrorist
government in Zimbabwe. Yet, both regimes continue to be the recipients of
millions of dollars in World Bank funding.
Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) is a classic case. After its independence, the
leftist government nationalized (confiscated) many of the farms previously
owned by white settlers. The most desirable of these lands became occupied
by the government's senior ruling-party officials, and the rest were turned
into state-run collectives. They were such miserable failures that the
workers on these farmlands were, themselves, soon begging for food.
Not daunted by these failures, the socialist
politicians announced in 2991 that they were going to nationalize half of
the remaining farms as well. And they barred the courts from inquiring into
how much compensation would be paid to their owners.
The IMP was represented in Zimbabwe at the time by Michel Camdessus,
the Governor of the central Bank of France, and a former finance minister in
Francois Mitterrand's Socialist government. After being informed of
Zimbabwe's plan to confiscate additional land and to resettle people to work
on those lands, Camdessus agreed to a loan valued at 42 billion rands with
full knowledge that much of it would be used for the resettlement project.
Perhaps the worst violations of human rights have occurred in Ethiopia under
the Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam.
The famine of 1984-85, which threatened the
lives of millions of people, was the result of government nationalization
and disruption of agriculture. Massive resettlement programs have torn
hundreds of thousands of people from their privately owned land in the north
and deported them to concentration-camp "villages" in the south, complete
with guard towers.
A report by a French voluntary
medical-assistance group, Doctors without Borders, reveals that the forced
resettlement program may have killed as many people as the famine itself.1
Dr. Rony Brauman, director of the
organization, describes their experience:
Armed militiamen burst into our compounds,
seized our equipment and menaced our volunteers. Some of our employees
were beaten, and our trucks, medicines and food stores confiscated.
We left Ethiopia branded as enemies of the
revolution. The regime spoke the truth. The atrocities committed in the
name of Mengistu's master plan did make us enemies of the revolution.2

Blaine Harden, Washington Post, December 3, 1985,p.A-21.

October 1986,p.71.
FINANCING FAMINE AND GENOCIDE
In the 1980s, the world was saddened by photographs of starving children in
Ethiopia, but what the West did not realize was that this was a planned
famine.
It was modeled after Stalin's starvation program
in the Ukraine in the 1930s and Mao's starvation of the peasants in the
'40s.
Its purpose was to starve the population into
total submission to the government, for it is the government which decides
who will eat and who will not. Yet, right up to the time Mengistu was
overthrown, the World Bank continued to send him hundreds of millions of
dollars, with much of it going specifically to the Ministry of Agriculture,
the very agency in charge of the resettlement program.1
In the late 1970s the same story unfolded in Communist Vietnam. There were
resettlement programs, forced collectivization, concentration camps,
atrocities, and tens of thousands of dissidents escaping to the sea only to
drown in overcrowded, leaky boats.
Throughout it all, the regime was generously
funded by the World Bank.
-
Laos has jailed thousands of political
prisoners
-
Syria has massacred 20,000 members of
its opposition; Indonesia has uprooted several million people from
their homelands in Java
-
the Sandinistas in Nicaragua murdered
their opposition and terrorized the nation into submission
-
Poland, while a puppet state of the
Soviet Union, brutally suppressed its trade-union movement
-
China massacred its dissident students
and imprisoned its religious leaders
-
the former Soviets slaughtered civilians
in Afghanistan while conducting a relentless espionage war against
the entire free world
Yet, these regimes have been the recipient of
literally billions of dollars from the World Bank.
How can the Bank's managers continue in conscience to fund such genocidal
regimes? Part of the answer is that they are not permitted to have a
conscience. David Dunn, head of the Bank's Ethiopia Desk explained:
"Political distinctions are not something our charter allows us to take into
account."2 The greater part of the answer, however, is that all socialist
regimes have the potential for genocide, and the Bank is committed to
socialism.
The brutalities of these countries are all in a
days work for serious socialists who view them as merely unfortunate
necessities for the building of their Utopia. Lenin said you cannot make an
omelet without cracking a few eggs.
George Bernard Shaw, one of the early
leaders of the Fabian Socialist movement, expressed it this way:
Under Socialism, you would not be allowed to
be poor. You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught, and
employed whether you liked it or not. If it were discovered that you had
not character and industry enough to be worth all this trouble, you
might possibly be executed in a kindly manner; but whilst you were
permitted to live, you would have to live well.1
REASON TO ABOLISH THE FEDERAL RESERVE
The top echelon at the World Bank are brothers under the skin to the
socialist dictators with whom they do daily business.
Under the right circumstances, they could easily
switch roles. What we have seen is merely a preview of what can be expected
for the entire world if the envisioned New World Order becomes operational.
The IMF/World Bank is the protégé of the Federal Reserve. It would not exist
without the flow of American dollars and the benevolence of American
leadership.
The Fed has become an accomplice in the support
of totalitarian regimes throughout the world. As stated at the beginning of
this study, that is one of the reasons it should be abolished: It is an
instrument of totalitarianism.
GETTING RICH FIGHTING POVERTY
While the top leaders and theoreticians at the IMF and World Bank dream of
world socialism, the middle managers and political rulers have more
immediate goals in mind.
The bureaucracy enjoys a plush life
administering the process, and the politicians on the receiving end obtain
wealth and power. Ideology is not their concern. Socialism, capitalism,
fascism, it makes no difference to them as long as the money flows.
Graham Hancock has been an astute observer of the international-aid
"industry" and has attended their plush conferences. He knows many of the
leading players personally.
In his book, Lords of Poverty, he speaks of the
IMF's Structural-Adjustment loans:
Corrupt Ministers of Finance and dictatorial
Presidents from Asia, Africa, and Latin America are tripping over their
own expensive footwear in their unseemly haste to "get adjusted." For
such people, money has probably never been easier to obtain than it is
today; with no complicated projects to administer and no messy accounts
to keep, the venal, the cruel and the ugly are laughing literally all
the way to the bank.
For them structural adjustment is like a
dream come true. No sacrifices are demanded of them personally. All they
have to do - amazing but true - is screw the poor, and they've already
had plenty of practice at that.1
1. Graham Hancock, Lords of Poverty:
The Power, Prestige, and Corruption of the International Aid Business (New
York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1989), pp. 59,60.
In India, the World Bank funded the construction of a dam that displaced two
million people, flooded 360 square miles, and wiped out 81,000 acres of
forest cover.
In Brazil, it spent a billion dollars to
"develop" a part of the Amazon basin and to fund a series of hydroelectric
projects. It resulted in the deforestation of an area half the size of Great
Britain and has caused great human suffering because of resettlement. In
Kenya, the Bura irrigation scheme caused such desolation that a fifth of the
native population abandoned the land.
The cost was $50,000 per family served. In
Indonesia, the transmigration program mentioned previously has devastated
tropical forests - at the same time that the World Bank is funding
reforestation projects. The cost of resettling one family is $7,000, which
is about ten-times the Indonesian per-capita income.
Livestock projects in Botswana led to the destruction of grazing land and
the death of thousands of migratory animals. This resulted in the inability
of the natives to obtain food by hunting, forcing them into dependence on
the government for survival. While Nigeria and Argentina are drowning in
debt, billions from the World Bank have gone into building lavish new
capital cities to house government agencies and the ruling elite.
In Zaire, Mexico, and the Philippines, political
leaders became billionaires while receiving World Bank loans on behalf of
their nations. In the Central African Republic, IMF and World Bank loans
were used to stage a coronation for its emperor.
The record of corruption and waste is endless. But the real eye-opener is in
the failure of socialist ventures, those magnificent projects which were to
bring prosperity to the underdeveloped countries.
Here are just a few examples.
CONVERTING MONEY INTO FAILURE
Before receiving loans from the World Bank, Tanzania was not wealthy, but it
fed its own people, and it had economic growth.
After receiving more than 3 billion dollars in loans, it nationalized the
nation's farms and industries and converted every business into a government
agency. It built a truck assembly plant, a tire factory, electronic
factories, highways, ports, railways, and dams. Tanzania's industrial
production and agricultural output fell by almost one-third. Food was the
main export in 1966.
Under socialism, food had to be imported - paid
for by foreign aid and more loans from the World Bank. The country is
hopelessly in debt with no way to repay.
Argentina once had one of the highest standards of living in Latin America.
But then it became the recipient of massive loans from the World Bank as
well as commercial banks in the United States- Since the money was given to
politicians, it was used to build the only system politicians know how to
build: socialism.
By 1982, the Gross National Product was in a
nose dive, manufacturing had fallen to less than half of capacity, thousands
of privately owned companies had been forced into bankruptcy, unemployment
was soaring, and so was welfare. By 1989, inflation was running at an
average of 5,000% and, in the summer of that year, topped at 1,000,000%!
Banks were offering interest rates of 600% per
month in hopes of keeping deposits from being moved out of the country.
People were rioting in the streets for food, and the government was blaming
greedy shop owners for raising prices. The nation was hopelessly in debt
with no way to repay.
Brazil is run by the military, and the state controls the economy.
Government-owned companies consume 65% of all industrial investment, which
means that the private sector is limited to 35% and is shrinking. The
government used loans from U.S. banks to create an oil company, Petroleo
Brasileiro S. A., which became Latin America's largest corporation.
Despite huge oil deposits and record-high oil
prices, the company operated at a loss and was not even able to produce
enough gasoline for its own citizens. By 1990, inflation was running at
5,000%.
Since 1960, its prices had risen to 164,000
times their original level. A new crime was invented called hedging against
inflation," and people were arrested for charging the free-market price for
their goods and for using dollars or gold as money.
Led by Communist organizers, mobs roamed the
streets shouting,
"We're hungry. Steal what you will!"
The nation was hopelessly in debt with no way to
repay.
The experience in Mexico was a carbon copy of that in Brazil, except that
the amount of money was larger. When the world's fourth largest oil reserves
were discovered, Mexican politicians reached for the brass ring. With
billions borrowed from U.S. banks, they launched Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX)
and soon became the world's fifth largest oil producer.
They also built chemical plants and railroads,
and launched many other industrial projects. These were run as welfare
agencies instead of businesses: too many people on the payroll, too many
managers, excessive salaries, too many holidays, and unrealistic benefits.
The ventures floundered and lost money. Private businesses failed by the
thousands, and unemployment rose.
The government increased the minimum wage
causing more businesses to fail and more unemployment. That led to more
welfare and unemployment benefits. To pay for that, the government borrowed
even more and began creating its own fiat money. Inflation destroyed what
was left of the economy.
Price controls were next, along with rent and food subsidies, and doubling
the minimum wage. By 1982, Mexicans were trading their pesos for dollars and
sending their savings out of the country, as the peso became all but
worthless in commerce.1 In 1981, the average wage for Mexican workers was
31% of the average wage for Americans.
By 1989, it had fallen to 10%. Mexico, once one
of the major food exporters in the world, was now required to import
millions of dollars worth of food grains.
This required still more money and more loans.
All this occurred while oil prices were high and production was booming. A
few years later, when oil prices fell, the failures and shortfalls became
even more dramatic.
In 1995, Mexico's bank loans were once again on the brink of default, and,
once again, U.S. taxpayers were thrown into the breech by Congress to cover
more than $30 billion at risk. Although this loan was eventually repaid, the
money to do so was extracted from the Mexican people through another round
of massive inflation, which plunged their standard of living even lower.
The nation is now hopelessly mired in socialism.
The Communist Party, promising "reform" and still more socialism, is
attracting a large following and could become a potent political force.
Thus, the saga continues. After pouring billions of dollars into
underdeveloped countries around the globe, no development has taken place.
In fact, we have seen just the opposite.
Most countries are worse off than before the
Saviors of the World got to them.
SUMMARY
The IMF and the World Bank, were created at a meeting of global financiers
and politicians held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944.
Their announced goals were to facilitate
international trade and to stabilize the exchange rates of national
currencies. The unannounced goals were quite different. They were the
elimination of the gold-exchange standard as the basis of currency valuation
and the establishment of world socialism.
The method by which gold was to be eliminated in international trade was to
replace it with a world currency which the IMF, acting as a world central
bank, would create out of nothing. The method by which world socialism was
to be established was to use the World Bank to transfer money - disguised as
loans - to the governments of the underdeveloped countries and to do so in
such a way as to insure the demise of free enterprise.
The money was to be delivered from the hands of
politicians and bureaucrats into the hands of other politicians and
bureaucrats. When the money comes from government, goes to government, and
is administered by government, the result will be the expansion of
government.
The theoreticians who dominated the conference at Bretton Woods were the
well-known Fabian Socialist from England, John Maynard Keynes, and the
Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Harry Dexter White. White became
the first Executive Director for the United States at the IMF.
The Fabians were an elite group of intellectuals who agreed with Communists
as to the goal of socialism but disagreed over tactics. Whereas Communists
advocated revolution by force and violence, Fabians advocated gradualism and
the transformation of society through legislation.
It was learned in later years that Harry Dexter White was a bomber of a
Communist espionage ring. Thus, hidden from view, there was a complex drama
taking place in which the two intellectual founders of the Bretton-Woods
accords were a Fabian Socialist and a Communist, working together to bring
about their mutual goal: world socialism.
Capital for the IMF and the World Bank comes from the industrialized
nations, with the United States putting up the most. Funds consist partly of
hard currencies - such as the dollar, yen, mark and franc - but these are
augmented by many times that amount in the form of "credits."
These are merely promises by the member
governments to get the money from their taxpayers if the Bank gets into
trouble with its loans.
While the IMF is gradually evolving into a central bank for the world, the
World Bank is serving as its lending arm. As such, it has become the engine
for transferring wealth from the industrialized nations to the
underdeveloped countries. While this has lowered the economic level of the
donating countries, it has not raised the level of the recipients.
The money has simply disappeared down the drain
of political corruption and waste.
Chapter
Six
BUILDING THE NEW WORLD ORDER
The Game-Called-Bailout reexamined and shown to be far more than merely a
means of getting taxpayers to foot the cost of bad loans; the final play
revealed as the merger of all nations into world government; the unfolding
of that strategy as applied to,
-
Panama
-
Mexico
-
Brazil
-
Argentina
-
China
-
Eastern Europe
-
Russia
Let us return now to the game called bailout.
Everything in the previous chapter has been merely background information to
understand the game as it is played in the international arena.
Here, finally, are the rules:
-
Commercial banks in the industrialized
nations, backed by their respective central banks, create money out
of nothing and lend it to the governments of underdeveloped nations.
They know that these are risky loans, so they charge an interest
rate that is high enough to compensate. It is more than what they
expect to receive in the long run.
-
When the underdeveloped nations cannot
pay the interest on their loans, the IMF and World Bank enter the
game as both players and referees. Using additional money created
out of nothing by the central banks of their member nations, they
advance "development" loans to the governments which now have enough
to pay the interest on the original loans with enough left over for
their own political purposes.
-
The recipient country quickly exhausts
the new supply of money, and the play returns to point number two.
This time, however, the new loans are guaranteed by the World Bank
and the central banks of the industrialized nations. Now that the
risk of default is removed, the commercial banks agree to reduce the
interest to the point anticipated at the beginning. The debtor
governments resume payments.
-
The final play is - well, in this
version of the game there appears to be no final play, because the
plan is to keep the game going forever. To make that possible,
certain things must happen that are very final, indeed. They include
the conversion of the IMF into a world central bank as Keynes had
planned, which then issues an international fiat money. Once that
"Bank of Issue" is in place, the IMF can collect unlimited resources
from the citizens of the world through the hidden tax called
inflation. The money stream then can be sustained indefinitely -
with or without the approval of the separate nations - because they
will no longer have money of their own.
Since this game results in a hemorrhage of
wealth from the industrialized nations, their economies are doomed to be
brought down further and further, a process that has been going on since
Bretton Woods.
The result will be a severe lowering of their
living standards and their demise as independent nations. The hidden reality
behind so-called development loans is that America and other industrialized
nations are being subverted by that process.
That is not an accident; it is the essence of
the plan. A strong nation is not likely to surrender its sovereignty.
Americans would not agree to turn over their monetary system, their
military, or their courts to a world body made up of governments which have
been despotic to their own people, especially since most of those regimes
have already revealed anti-American hostility.
But if Americans can be brought to the point
where they are suffering from a collapse of their economy and from a
breakdown in civil order, things will be different. When they stand in bread
lines and face anarchy in their streets, they will be more willing to give
up sovereignty in return for "assistance" from the World Bank and the UN
"peacekeeping" forces.
This will become even more acceptable if a
structured demise of Communism can be arranged ahead of time to make it
appear that the world's major political systems have converged into the
common denominator of "social democracy."
THE FINAL PLAY
The underdeveloped nations, on the
other hand, are not being raised up.
What is happening to them is that their
political leaders are becoming addicted to the IMF cash flow and will be
unable to break the habit. These countries are being conquered by money
instead of arms. Soon they will no longer be truly independent nations. They
are becoming mere components in the system of world socialism planned by
Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes.
Their leaders are being groomed to become
potentates in a new, high-tech feudalism, paying homage to their Lords in
New York. And they are eager to do it in return for privilege and power
within the "New
World Order."
That is the final play.
The essence of socialism is redistribution of the wealth. The goal is
equality, and that means taking from the rich and giving to the poor. At
least that's the theory. Unfortunately, the poor are never benefited by this
maneuver.
They either do not get the money in the first
place - too much is siphoned off by the bureaucracies which administer the
programs - or, if they do get any of it, they don't know what to do with it.
They merely spend it until it is gone, and then no one has any money -
except, of course, those who administer the government programs.
Nevertheless, politicians know that promises to
redistribute the wealth are popular among two groups: the voters who naively
believe it will help the poor, and the socialist managers who see it as job
security. Supported by these two voting blocs, election to office is
assured.
One of the early American advocates of socialism on a global scale -
including the draining of wealth away from the "rich" United States - was
John F. Kennedy.
He undoubtedly learned the concept while
attending the Fabian London School of Economics in 1935-36 just prior to his
father's appointment as Ambassador to England. When JFK became President,
his political views continued to carry the imprint of that training.
In September of 1963, he addressed the finance
ministers and central-bank governors from 102 nations at the annual meeting
of the IMF/World Bank.
He explained the concept of world socialism in
glowing terms:
Twenty years ago, when the architects of
these institutions met to design an international banking structure, the
economic life of the world was polarized in overwhelming, and even
alarming, measure on the United States... Sixty per cent of the gold
reserves of the world were here in the United States...
There was a need for redistribution of the
financial resources of the world... And there was an equal need to
organize a flow of capital to the impoverished countries of the world.
AJJ this has come about. It did not come about by chance but by
conscious and deliberate and responsible planning.1
CFR SETS STRATEGY
The brain trust for implementing the Fabian plan in America is called the
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
We shall look at it closely in future chapters,
but it is important to know at this point that almost all of America's
leadership has come from this small group. That includes our presidents and
their advisers, cabinet members, ambassadors, board members of the Federal
Reserve System, directors of the largest banks and investment houses,
presidents of universities, and heads of metropolitan newspapers, news
services, and TV networks.2
It is not an exaggeration to describe this group
as the hidden government of the United States.
CFR members have never been shy about calling for the weakening of America
as a necessary step toward the greater good of building world government.
One of the CFR founders was John Foster Dulles, who later was appointed
Secretary-of-State by CFR member Dwight Eisenhower.
In 1939, Dulles said:
Some dilution or leveling off of the
sovereignty system as it prevails in the world today must take place...
to the immediate disadvantage of those nations which now possess the
preponderance of power... The establishment of a common money... would
deprive our government of exclusive control over a national money...
The United States must be prepared to make
sacrifices afterward in setting up a worJd politico-economic order which
would level off inequalities of economic opportunity with respect to
nations.3
CFR member
Zbigniew Brzezinski was the National Security Adviser to CFR
member Jimmy Carter. In 1970, Brzezinski wrote:
... some international cooperation has
already been achieved, but further progress will require greater
American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world
monetary structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk
to the present relatively favorable American position.4

Monetary Parley/' New York Times, October 1, 1963, p. 16.

members, see James Perloff, Shadows of Power (Appleton, Wisconsin: Western
Islands, 1988).

Era (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1970), p. 300.
At the Spring, 1983, Economic Summit in
Williamsburg, Virginia, President Ronald Reagan declared:
National economies need monetary
coordination mechanisms, and that is why an integrated world economy
needs a common monetary standard... But, no national currency will do -
only a world currency will work.
The CFR strategy for convergence of the world's
monetary systems was spelled out by Harvard Professor Richard N. Cooper,
a CFR member who had been the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs
in the Carter Administration:
I suggest a radical alternative scheme for
the next century: the creation of a common currency for all of the
industrial democracies, with a common monetary policy and a joint Bank
of Issue to determine that monetary policy... How can independent states
accomplish that? They need to turn over the determination of monetary
policy to a supranational body.
It is highly doubtful whether the American
public, to take just one example, could ever accept that countries with
oppressive autocratic regimes should vote on the monetary policy that would
affect monetary conditions in the United States...
For such a bold step to work at all, it
presupposes a certain convergence of political values....
Phrases such as, monetary coordination mechanisms, modern world economic
order, convergence of political values, or new world order are not very
specific. To the average person, they sound pleasant and harmless. Yet, to
the insiders of the club, they are code phrases which have a specific
meaning: the termination of national sovereignty and the creation of world
government.
CFR member, Richard Gardner - another
adviser to President Carter - explains the meaning of these phrases and also
calls for the Fabian strategy of deception and gradualism:
In short, the "house of world order" will
have to be built from the bottom up... An end run around national
sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than
the old-fashioned frontal assault.
As for the programmed decline of the American
economy, CFR Member Samuel Huntington argues that, if higher
education is considered to be desirable for the general population,
"a program is then necessary to lower the
job expectations of those who receive a college education."1
CFR member Paul Volcker, former Chairman
of the Federal Reserve, says:
"The standard of living of the average
American has to decline... I don't think you can escape that."2
By 1993, Volcker had become the U.S. Chairman of
the Trilateral Commission.
The TLC was created by David Rockefeller to
coordinate the building of The New World Order in accordance with the
Gardner strategy:
"An end run around national sovereignty,
eroding it piece by piece."
The objective is to draw the United States,
Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Western Europe into political and economic union.
Under slogans such as free trade and environmental protection, each nation
is to surrender its sovereignty "piece by piece" until a full-blown regional
government emerges from the process.
The new government will control each nation's
working conditions, wages, and taxes. Once that has happened, it will be a
relatively simple step to merge the regionals into global government.
That is the reality behind the so-called trade
treaties within,
-
the European Union (EU)
-
the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA)
-
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
agreement (APEC)
-
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT)
They have little to do with trade. In the
Trilateral Commission's annual report for 1993, Volcker explains:
Interdependence is driving our countries
toward convergence in areas once considered fully within the domestic
purview. Some of these areas involve government regulatory policy, such
as environmental standards, the fair treatment of workers, and taxation.3

In 1992, the Trilateral Commission released a
report co-authored by Toyoo Gyohten, Chairman of the Board of the
Bank of Tokyo and formerly Japan's Minister of Finance for International
Affairs.
Gyohten had been a Fulbright Scholar who was
trained at Princeton and taught at Harvard Business School. He also had been
in charge of the Japan Desk of the International Monetary Fund. In short, he
represents the Japanese monetary interests within The New World Order.
In this report, Gyohten explains that the real
importance of "trade" agreements is not trade but the building of global
government:
Regional trade arrangements should not be
regarded as ends in themselves, but as supplements to global
liberalization... Regional arrangements provide models or building
blocks for increased or strengthened globalism...
Western Europe [the EU] represents
regionalism in its truest form... The steps toward deepening [increasing
the number of agreements] are dramatic and designed to be
irreversible...
A common currency... central bank... court
and parliament - will have expanded powers... After the Maastricht
summit [the Dutch town where the meeting was held], an Economist
editorial pronounced the verdict: "Call it what you will: by any other
name it is federal government."...
In sum, the regional integration process in
Europe can be seen as akin to an exercise in nation-building.
Applying this same perspective to the NAFTA treaty, former
Secretary-of-State,
Henry Kissinger (CFR), said it,
"is not a conventional trade agreement but
the architecture of a new international system... the vital first step
for a new kind of community of nations."
The newspaper article that contained this
statement was appropriately entitled:
"With NAFTA, U.S. Finally Creates a New
World Order."2
David Rockefeller (CFR) was even more emphatic.
He said that it would be "criminal" not to pass the treaty because:
"Everything is in place - after 500 years -
to build a true 'new world' in the Western Hemisphere."3

By early 1994, the drift toward the New World
Order had become a rush.
On April 15, the government of Morocco placed a
full-page ad in the New York Times celebrating the creation of the World
Trade Organization which was formed by the signing of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which took place in the Moroccan city of
Marrakech. While Americans were still being told that GATT was merely a
"trade" agreement, the internationalists were celebrating a much larger
concept.
The ad spelled it out in unmistakable terms:
1944, Bretton Woods: The IMF and the World
Bank
1945, San Francisco: The United Nations
1994, Marrakech: The World Trade
Organization
History knows where it is going...
The World Trade Organization, the third
pillar of the New World Order,
along with the United Nations and the
International Monetary Fund.1
A RARE GLIMPSE INTO THE INNER WORKINGS
So much for the final play. Let us return, now, to the game called bailout
as it is actually played today on the international scene.
Let us begin with a glimpse into the inner
workings of the Presidential Cabinet James Watt was the Secretary of the
Interior in the Reagan Administration. In his memoirs, he described an
incident at a Cabinet meeting in the spring of 1982. The first items on the
agenda were reports by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and Budget Director
David Stockman concerning problems the less-developed countries were having
with their bank loans.
Watt said:
Secretary Regan was explaining the inability
of those destitute countries to pay even the interest on the loans that
individual banks such as Bank of America, Chase Manhattan and Citibank
had made. The President was being told what actions the United States
"must" take to salvage the situation.
After the Regan and Stockman briefings, there
were several minutes of discussion before I asked,
"Does anyone believe that these less
developed countries will ever be able to pay back the principal on these
loans?"
When no one spoke up, I asked,
"If the loans are never going to be repaid,
why should we again bail out the countries and arrange payment for their
interest?"
The answer came from several voices at once,
"If we don't arrange for their interest
payments, the loans will go into default, and it could put our American
banks in jeopardy."
Would the customers lose their money? No, came
the answer, but the stockholders might lose dividends.
In amazement, I leaned back in my large, leather chair, only two seats from
the President of the United States. I realized that nothing in the world
could keep these high government officials from scrambling to protect and
bail out a few very large and sorely troubled American banks.2

A9.

Schuster, 1985), pp. 124-25.
PANAMA
The first major score in the game had been made under the Carter
Administration when Panama fell in arrears on the payment of its loans.
A consortium of banks including Chase Manhattan,
First National of Chicago, and Citibank brought pressure to bear on
Washington to give the Canal to the Panamanian government so it could use
the revenue to pay interest on its loans.
Although there was massive opposition to this
move among the American people, the Senate yielded to insider pressure and
passed the give-away treaty. The Panamanian government inherited $120
million in annual revenue, and the interest payments to the banks were
restored.
As Congressman Philip Crane observed:
At the time of the Torrijos-backed coup in
1968, Panama's total official overseas debt stood at a manageable and,
by world standards, modest $167 million.
Under Torrijos, indebtedness has skyrocketed
nearly one thousand percent to a massive $1.5 billion. Debt-service
ratio now consumes an estimated 39 percent of the entire Panamanian
budget...
What it appears we really have here is not
just aid to a tinhorn dictator in the form of new subsidies and canal
revenues the treaties would give to the Torrijos regime, but a bailout
of a number of banks which should have known better than to invest in
Panama and, in any event, should not escape responsibility for having
done so.1
1- Philip M. Crane, Surrender in Panama
(Ottawa, Illinois: Caroline House Books, pp. 64,68.
The Panama bailout was a unique play.
In no other country did we have an
income-producing property to give away, so from that point forward the
bailout would have to be done with mere money. To pave the way for that,
Congress passed the Monetary Control Act of 1980 which authorized the
Federal Reserve to "monetize foreign debt."
That is banker language meaning that the Fed was
now authorized to create money out of nothing for the purpose of lending to
foreign governments. It classifies those loans as "assets" and then uses
them as collateral for the creation of even more money here in the United
States. That was truly a revolutionary expansion of the Fed's power to
inflate.
Until then, it was permitted to make money only
for the American government Now, it was able to do it for any government.
Since then it has been functioning as a central bank for the entire world.
MEXICO
By 1982, almost every Third-World government was running behind in payments.
Mexico led the way by announcing it could not
send any more money that year on its $85 billion debt. Federal Reserve
Governor Henry Wallich rushed to Switzerland to negotiate an IMF loan
of $4.5 billion through the Bank of International Settlements. The central
banks of Europe and Japan provided $1.85 billion (about 40%); the rest came
from the Federal Reserve.
Commercial banks postponed payments on the
principal for two years; but, with the infusion of new loans, payment on the
interest was resumed. That did not solve the problem. Within a few years,
Mexico was in arrears again and, in 1985, the banks agreed to postpone $29
billion in payments and rolled over another $20 billion, which means they
issued new loans to pay off the old.
In that same year, Secretary of the Treasury James Baker announced
the government's plan to solve the world's debt crisis. It was a formal
statement encouraging banks to continue lending to Third-World governments
provided they promised to enact economic reforms favoring a free market. It
was more of a philosophy than a plan, because there was no hope that it
would be implemented by any of the socialist governments receiving the
loans.
Behind the announcement was the implication that
the federal government acting through the Federal Reserve System, could be
counted on to assist if the loans went sour.
Baker called for funneling $29 billion over
three years primarily to Latin American countries, of which Mexico was a
prime recipient.
CURRENCY SWAP
Shortly after the Mexican government had loaned $55 million to Fidel Castro,
it announced to the banks:
"We will pay only what we have, and no
more."
Whereupon Paul Volcker, head of the Federal
Reserve, rushed to meet with Mexico's finance minister, Jesus Silva
Herzog, and offered to put the American taxpayer into the breach.
A $600 million short-term loan was extended to
get Mexico past its election date of July 4. It was called a "currency swap"
because Mexico exchanged an equal number of pesos which it promised to
redeem in U.S. dollars. Pesos, of course, were worthless in international
markets - which is the reason Mexico wanted the dollars.
The importance of this loan was not its size nor even the question of
repayment. It was the manner in which it was made.
First, it was made by the Federal Reserve directly, acting as a central bank
for Mexico, not the U.S.; and secondly, it was done almost in total secrecy.
William Greider gives the details:
The currency swaps had another advantage:
they could be done secretly. Volcker discreetly informed both the
Administration and the key congressional chairmen, and none objected.
But the public reporting of currency swaps was required only every
quarter, so the emergency loan from the Fed would not be disclosed for
three or four months...
By that time, Volcker hoped, Mexico would be
arranging more substantial new financing from the IMF... The foreign
assistance was done as discreetly as possible to avoid setting off a
panic, but also to avoid domestic political controversy...
Bailing out Mexico, it seemed, was too grave
to be controversial.1
DEBT SWAP
The currency swap did not solve the
problem.
So, in March of 1988, the players and referees
agreed to introduce a new maneuver in the game: an accounting trick called a
"debt swap." A debt swap is similar to a currency swap in that the United
States exchanges something of real value in return for something that is
worthless. But instead of currencies, they exchange government bonds. The
transaction is complicated by the time-value of those bonds.
Currencies are valued by their immediate worth,
what they will buy today, but bonds are valued by their future worth, what
they will buy in the future. After that differential factor is calculated,
the process is essentially the same. Here is how it worked.
Mexico, using U.S. dollars, purchased $492 million worth of American
Treasury Bonds that pay no interest but which will pay $3.67 billion when
they mature in twenty years. (Technically, these are called zero-coupon
bonds.)
Then Mexico issued its own bonds with the US.
securities tied to them as collateral. This meant that the future value of
Mexico's bonds, previously considered worthless, were now guaranteed by the
United States government. The banks eagerly swapped their old loans for
these new Mexican bonds at a ratio of about 1.4 to 1. In other words, they
accepted $100 million in bonds in return for canceling $140 million in old
debt.
That reduced their interest income, but they
were happy to do it, because they had swapped worthless loans for
fully-guaranteed bonds.
This maneuver was hailed in the press as true monetary magic. It would save
the Mexican government more than $200 million in annual interest charges; it
would restore cash flow to the banks; and - miracle of miracles - it would
cost nothing to American taxpayers.1
The reasoning was that the Treasury bonds were
sold at normal market rates. The Mexican government paid as much for them as
anyone else. That part was true, but what the commentators failed to notice
was where Mexico got the American dollars with which to buy the bonds. They
came through the IMF in the form of "foreign-currency exchange reserves."
In other words, they were subsidies from the
industrialized nations, primarily the United States. So, the U.S. Treasury
put up the lion's share of the money to buy its own bonds. It went a
half-billion dollars deeper in debt and agreed to pay $3.7 billion more in
future payments so the Mexican government could continue paying interest to
the banks.
That is called bailout, and it does fall on the
American taxpayer.
IMF BECOMES FINAL GUARANTOR
The following year, Secretary of State, James Baker (CFR),
and Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady (CFR), flew to Mexico to work
out a new debt agreement that would begin to phase in the IMF as final
guarantor.
The IMF gave Mexico a new loan of $3.5 billion
(later increased to $7.5 billion), the World Bank gave another $1,5 billion,
and the banks reduced their previous loan values by about a third. The
private banks were quite willing to extend new loans and reschedule the old.
Why not? Interest payments would now be guaranteed by the taxpayers of the
United States and Japan.
That did not permanently solve the problem, either, because the Mexican
economy was suffering from massive inflation caused by internal debt, which
was in addition to the external debt owed to the banks.
The phrases "internal debt" and "domestic
borrowing" are code for the fact that government has inflated its money
supply by selling bonds.
The interest it must pay to entice people to
purchase those bonds can be staggering and, in fact, interest on Mexico's
domestic borrowing was draining three times as much from the economy as the
foreign debt service had been siphoning off.2
1. "U.S. Bond Issue Will Aid Mexico in
Paying Debts/' by Tom Redburn, Los Angeles Times, December 30, 1987.
2. "With Foreign IOUs Massaged, Interest Turns to Internal Debt," Insight,
October 2, 1989, p. 34.
Notwithstanding this reality, Citicorp chairman, John S. Reed (CFR)/ whose
bank is one of Mexico's largest lenders, said they were prepared to lend
even more now. Why?
Did it have anything to do with the fact that
the Federal Reserve and the IMF would guarantee payments? Not so.
"Because we believe the Mexican economy is
doing well," he said.1
1- ibid, p. 35.
At the end of 1994, the game was still going,
and the play was the same.
On December 21, the Mexican government announced
that it could no longer pay the fixed exchange rate between the peso and the
dollar and that the peso would now have to float in the free market to find
its true value. The next day it plummeted 39 per cent, and the Mexican stock
market tumbled.
Once again, Mexico could not pay the interest on
its loans. On January 11, President Clinton (CFR) urged Congress to approve
U.S. guarantees for new loans up to $40 billion.
Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin (CFR)
explained:
"It is the judgment of all, including
Chairman Alan Greenspan [CFR], that the probability of the debts being
paid [by Mexico] is exceedingly high."
But, while Congress debated the issue, the loan
clock was ticking. Payment of $17 billion in Mexican bonds was due within 60
days, and $4 billion of that was due on the first of February! Who was going
to pay the banks?
This matter could not wait.
On January 31, acting independently of Congress,
President Clinton announced a bailout package of over $50 billion in loan
guarantees to Mexico; $20 billion from the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund,
$17.8 billion from the IMF, $10 billion from the Bank of International
Settlements, and $3 billion from commercial banks.
BRAZIL
Brazil became a major player in 1982 when it announced that it too was
unable to make payments on its debt In response, the U.S. Treasury made a
direct loan of $1.23 billion to keep those checks going to the banks while
negotiations were under way for a more Permanent solution through the IMF.
Twenty days later, it gave another $1.5 billion;
the Bank of International Settlements advanced $1-2 billion.
The following month, the IMF provided $5.5
billion; Western banks extended $10 billion in trade credits; old loans were
rescheduled; and $4.4 billion in new loans were made by a Morgan Bank
syndication.
The "temporary" loans from the U.S. Treasury
were extended with no repayment date established.
Ron Chernow comments:
The plan set a fateful precedent of "curing"
the debt crisis by heaping on more debt. In this charade, bankers would
lend more to Brazil with one hand, then take it back with the other.
This preserved the fictitious book value of
loans on bank balance sheets. Approaching the rescue as a grand new
syndication, the bankers piled on high interest rates and rescheduling
fees.1
1. Chernow, p. 644.
By 1983, Third-World governments owed $300
billion to banks and $400 billion to the industrialized governments.
Twenty-five nations were already behind in their
payments. Brazil was in default a second time and asked for rescheduling, as
did Rumania, Cuba, and Zambia. The IMF stepped in and made additional
billions of dollars available to the delinquent countries. The Department of
Agriculture, through its Commodity Credit Corporation, paid $431 million to
American banks to cover payments on loans from Brazil, Morocco, Peru, and
Rumania.
At the conclusion of these agreements, the April
20, 1983, Wall Street Journal editorialized that,
"the international debt crisis... is, for
all practical purposes, over."
Not quite.
By 1987, Brazil was again in default on its
monstrous $121 billion debt, this time for one and a-half years. In spite of
the torrent of money that had passed through its hands, it was now so broke,
it couldn't even buy gasoline for its police cars.
In 1989, as a new round of bailout was being
organized, President
Bush (CFR) announced that the only real solution to the
Third-World debt problem was debt forgiveness.
Perhaps, through repetition, we are running this history into the ground,
but here are just a few more examples before moving along.
ARGENTINA
By 1982, Argentina was unable to make a $2.3 billion payment that was due in
July and August.
The banks extended their loans while the IMF
prepared a new infusion in the amount of $2.15 billion. This restored the
interest payments and gave the Argentinean politicians a little extra
spending money. Seven months later, Argentina announced it could not make
any more payments until the fall of 1983. The banks immediately began
negotiations for rollovers, guarantees, and new IMF loans.
Argentina then signed an agreement with 350 creditor banks to stretch out
payments on nearly a fourth of its $13.4 billion debt, and the banks agreed
to lend an extra $4.2 billion to cover interest payments and political
incentives. The IMF gave $1.7 billion.
The United States government gave an additional
$500 million directly. Argentina then paid $850 million in overdue interest
charges to the banks.
By 1988, Argentina had again stopped payment on its loans and was falling
hopelessly behind as bankers and politicians went into a huddle to call the
next bailout play. Somehow, the payments had to be passed on one more time
to the taxpayers - which they were in the form of new loans, rollovers, and
guarantees.
As summarized by Larry A. Sjaastad at the
University of Chicago:
There isn't a U.S. bank that would not sell
its entire Latin American portfolio for 40 cents on the dollar were it
not for the possibility that skillful political lobbying might turn up a
sucker willing to pay 50 or 60 or even 90 cents on the dollar. And that
sucker is the U.S. Taxpayer.1
As mentioned previously, this history can become
repetitious and boring. It would be counterproductive to cover the same
sordid story as it has unfolded in each country.
Suffice it to say that the identical game has
been played with teams from,
-
Bolivia
-
Peru
-
Venezuela
-
Costa Rica
-
Morocco
-
the Philippines
-
the Dominican Republic,
...and almost every other less-developed country
in the world.
THE NEED FOR CONVERGENCE
This sets the stage for understanding the next phase of the game which is
unfolding as these words are being written.
It is the inclusion of China and the former
Soviet bloc into the Grand Design for global government. As with all the
other countries in the world, the primary mechanism being used to accomplish
this goal - at least in the field of economics - is the IMF/World Bank.2
1- ''Another Plan to Mop Up the Mess,"
Insight, April 10, 1989, p. 31.
2- Other mechanisms which involve culture, education, political sovereignty,
and military power are embodied in agencies of
the United Nations.
The process is:
-
the transfer of money from the
industrialized nations - which drags them down economically to a
suitable common denominator
-
the acquisition of effective control
over the political leaders of the recipient countries as they become
dependent upon the money stream
The thing that is new and which sets this stage
apart from previous developments is that the apparent crumbling of Communism
has created an acceptable rationale for the industrialized nations to now
allow their lifeblood to flow into the veins of their former enemies.
It also creates the appearance of global,
political "convergence/' a condition which CFR theoretician, Richard Cooper,
said was necessary before Americans would accept having their own destinies
determined by governments other than their own.
CHINA
Red China joined the IMF/World Bank in 1980 and immediately began to receive
billions of dollars in loans, although it was well known that she was
devoting a huge portion of her resources to military development.
By 1987, China was the IMF's second largest
borrower, next to India, and the transfusions have grown at a steady pace
ever since.
The Bank has asserted that loans will encourage economic reforms in favor of
the private sector. Yet, none of the money has gone to the private sector.
All of it is funneled into the government bureaucracy which, in turn, wages
war against the free market. In 1989, after small businesses and farms in
the private sector had begun to flourish and surpass the performance of
similar government enterprises, Red China's leaders clamped down on them
with harsh controls and increased taxes.
Vice Premier Yao Yilin announced that there was
too much needless construction, too many private loans, and too much
spending on "luxuries" such as cars and banquets. To stop these excesses, he
said, it would be necessary to increase government controls over wages,
prices, and business activities.
Then there is the question of why China needs the money in the first place.
Is it to develop her industry or natural resources? Is it to fight poverty
and improve the living standard of her citizens?
James Bovard answers:
The Bank's defense of its China Policy is
especially puzzling because China itself is going on a foreign
investment binge.
The World Bank gives China money at zero
interest, and then China buys property in Hong Kong, the United States,
Australia, and elsewhere. An economist with Citibank estimated that
China's "direct investment in property, manufacturing and services [in
Hong Kong alone] topped $6 billion."
In 1984, China had a net outflow of capital
of $1 billion. Moreover, China has its own foreign aid program, which
has given more than $6 billion in recent decades, largely to leftist
governments.1
1- Bovard, pp. 18-19.
THE GREAT DECEPTION
It is the author's contention that the much heralded demise of Communism in
the Soviet bloc is a mixture of fact and fantasy.
It is fact at the bottom level of Communist
society where the people, in truth, rejected it long ago. The only reason
they appeared to embrace it for so many years was that they had no choice.
As long as the Soviets held control of the weapons and the means of
communication, the people had to accept their fate.
But at the tip of the pyramid of state power, it is a different story. The
top Communist leaders have never been as hostile to their counterparts in
the West as the rhetoric suggests. They are quite friendly to the world's
leading financiers and have worked closely with them when it suits their
purposes. As we shall see in the following section, the Bolshevik revolution
actually was financed by wealthy financiers in London and New York.
Lenin and Trotsky were on the closest of terms
with these moneyed interests - both before and after the Revolution. Those
hidden liaisons have continued to this day and occasionally pop to the
surface when we discover a David Rockefeller holding confidential meetings
with a Mikhail Gorbachev in the absence of government sponsorship or
diplomatic purpose.
It is not unreasonable to imagine a scenario in which the leaders of the
Communist bloc come to realize they cannot hold themselves in power much
longer. There comes a point where even physical force is not enough,
especially when the loyalties of those who hold the weapons also begin to
falter. With economic gangrene creeping UP the legs of their socialist
systems, they realize they must obtain outside financial assistance or
perish.
In such a scenario, quiet agreements can be worked out to the Mutual
advantage of all negotiators. The plan could be as simple as a
statue-of-liberty play in a college football game: the appearance of doing
one thing as a cover for accomplishing something else.
While Americans are prepared to accept such
deception on a football field, they cannot believe that world financiers and
politicians are capable of it. The concept is rejected out of hand as a
"conspiracy theory."
Nevertheless, in this scenario, we theorize it is agreed among the
negotiators that the Soviet Bloc needs financial support. It is agreed that
the Western nations have the capacity to provide it. It is agreed that the
best way to move money from the industrialized nations into the Soviet bloc
is through international agencies such as the IMF/World Bank.
It is agreed this cannot happen until hostility
between world systems is replaced by political convergence. It is agreed
that future conflict is wasteful and dangerous to all parties. Therefore, it
is finally agreed that the Soviet bloc must abandon its posture of global
aggression while the Western nations continue to move toward socialism,
necessary steps for the long-range goal of merger into a world government.
But, in doing so, it must be insured that the
existing Communist leaders retain control over their respective states.
COMMUNISTS BECOME SOCIAL DEMOCRATS
To that end, they change their public identities to "Social Democrats."
They speak out against the brutal excesses of
their predecessors and they offer greater freedom of expression in the
media. A few dispensable individuals among their ranks are publicly purged
as examples of the demise of the old order. States that once were held
captive by the Soviet Union are allowed to break away and then return on a
voluntary basis. If any leaders of the newly emancipated states prefer true
independence instead of alignment with Russia, they are replaced.
No other changes are required.
Socialism remains the economic system of choice
and, although lip service may be given to free^market concepts, the economy
and all means of production remain under state control. The old Communists
are now Social Democrats and, without exception, they become the leaders in
the new system.
The West rejoices, and the money starts to move. As an extra bonus, the
former Bolsheviks are now hailed by the world as great statesmen who put an
end to the Cold War, brought freedom to their people, and helped to forge a
New World Order.
When did Communism depart? We are not quite sure. All we know is that one
day we opened our newspapers and it was accomplished. Social Democrats were
everywhere. No one could find any Communists.
Russian leaders spoke as long-time enemies of
the old regime. Perestroika was here. Communism was dead. It was not killed
by an enemy. It voted itself out of existence. It committed suicide!
Does it not seem strange that Communism fell without a struggle? Is it not
curious that the system which was born out of class conflict and revolution
and which maintained itself by force and violence for almost a century just
went away on its own? Communism was not overthrown by people rising up with
clubs and pitchforks to throw off their yoke of tyranny.
There was no revolution or counterrevolution, no
long period of fragmentation, no bloody surges between opposing forces.
Poof! It just happened. True, there was blood in the streets in those areas
where opposing groups vied for power, but that was after Communism had
departed, not before. Such an event had never occurred in history.
Until then, it had been contrary to the way
governments act; contrary to the very nature of power which never surrenders
without a life-and-death struggle. This, indeed, is a great curiosity -
which should cause people to think.
Our premise is that the so-called demise of Communism is a Great Deception -
not awfully different from many of the others that are the focus of this
volume. We see it as having been stage managed for the purposes outlined
previously: the transition to world government. In our view, that scenario
is the only one that makes sense in terms of today's geopolitical realities
and the only one consistent with the lessons of history.
We realize, of course, that such a view runs contrary to popular opinion and
conventional wisdom. For many, it is shocking just to hear it spelled out.
It would not be possible to convince anyone of its truth without extensive
evidence. Certainly, such evidence abounds, but it is not within the scope
of this study.
So, now that we have stated it, we shall leave
it behind merely as a clarification °f the author's point of view so the
reader can step around it if he wishes.
EASTERN EUROPE
American aid to Eastern European governments, while they were still puppet
states of the Soviet Union, has been justified by the same theory advanced
on behalf of China:
it would improve their economies, show their
people a better way of life, and wean them from Communism Advocates of
that theory now point to the demise of Communism as evidence of the
soundness of their plan.
The truth, however, is that the money did not
improve the economy and did not show the people a better way of life. In
fact, it did not help the people in any way. It went directly to their
governments and was used for government priorities. It strengthened the
ruling parties and enabled them to solidify their control.
It is well known that one of the reasons Poland's economy was weak is that
much of her productive output was shipped to the Soviet Union at
concessionary prices, primarily to support the military.
Polish-built tanks fought in the Vietnam war;
20% of the Soviet merchant marine was built in Poland; 70% of Poland's
computer and locomotive production and 80% of her communications equipment
was shipped to the Soviets; American grain purchased by Poland with money
borrowed from American banks was sent to Cuba. Poland was merely a middle
man, a conduit to Russia and her satellites.
The banks were really funding Russia.
It was in 1982 that Poland first defaulted on bank loans which had been
guaranteed by the U.S. government through the Commodity Credit Corporation.
Under the terms of the guarantee, taxpayers would make payments on any bank
loan that went into default. That was what the banks were counting on when
they made those loans, but to classify them as "in default" would require
the banks to remove them from their books as assets.
That was unacceptable, because it would make
their balance sheets look as bad as they really were. So the Treasury agreed
to bend the rules and make payments without requiring the loans to be in
default. That was eventually stopped by an irate Congress, but not until the
Reagan Administration had stalled long enough to pay $400 million directly
to the banks on behalf of Poland.
In November, 1988, the World Bank made its first loan to Poland in the
amount of $17.9 million. Three years later, in a dramatic demonstration of
what the President had meant when he advocated "debt forgiveness," the Bush
Administration canceled a full 70% of the $3.8 billion owed to the United
States. Taxpayers picked up the bill.
The same story has been unfolding in all the former Soviet bloc countries.
In 1980, for example, just before Hungary was brought into the IMF/World
Bank, her annual per-capita GNP was $4,180.
This was a problem, because the policy of the
World Bank was to make development loans only to countries that had
per-capita GNPs of less than $2,650. Not to worry. In 1981, the Hungarian
government simply revised its statistics downward from $4,180 to $2,100.1
1- "World Bank Courts Eastern Europe,"
by Jerry Lewis, Wall Street Journal August 30, 1984.
That was a drop of 50% in one year, surely one
of the sharpest depressions in world history. Everyone knew it was a lie,
but no one raised an eyebrow. It was all part of the game.
By 1989, the Bush Administration had granted
"most favored nation" trade status to the Hungarian government and
established on its behalf a special $25 million development fund.
RUSSIA
American banks had always been willing to make loans to the Soviet Union,
except for short periods of expediency during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the
Vietnam War, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and other minor business
interruptions.
In 1985, after the public had lost interest in
Afghanistan, banks of the "free world" reopened their loan windows to the
Soviets.
A $400 million package was put together by a
consortium of First National of Chicago, Morgan Guaranty, Bankers Trust, and
Irving Trust - plus a London subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada.
The loan was offered at unusually low interest
rates "to buy American and Canadian grain."
Public indignation is easily disarmed when the announced purpose of a loan
to a totalitarian government is to purchase commodities from the country
where the loan originates - especially if the commodity is grain for the
assumed purpose of making bread or feeding livestock.
Who could possibly object to having the money
come right back to our own farmers and merchants in the form of profits? And
who could fault a project that provided food for the hungry?
The deception is subtly appealing. It is true
that the money will be used - in part at least - to buy grain or other
locally produced commodities.
But the borrowing nations are like a homeowner
who increases the mortgage on his house "to enlarge his living room." He
probably will make the addition, but he borrows twice as much as he needs so
he can also buy a new car. Since the government allows a tax deduction on
mortgage interest, in effect he now gets a tax deduction for the interest
paid on his car as well.
Likewise, the borrowing nations usually borrow
more than they need for the announced purchase, but they receive all the
money at favorable rates.
Yet, this is not the most serious fault in the transaction. In the case of
Russia, the grain was no small item on her list of needs. After repeated
failures of her socialist agriculture, she was not able to feed her
population. Hungry people are dangerous to a government. Russia needed grain
to head off internal revolt far more than the homeowner needed to increase
the size of his living room.
In other words, Russia had to have the grain,
with or without the loan, Without it, she would have had to curtail spending
somewhere else to obtain the money, most likely in her military. By giving
her the money "to buy grain" we actually allowed her to spend more money on
armaments.
But even that is not the primary flaw in making loans to Russia. The bottom
line is that most of those loans will never be repaid).
As we have seen, the name of the game is
bailout, and it is as certain as the setting sun that, somewhere down the
line, Russia will not be able to make her payments, and the taxpayers of the
industrialized nations will be put through the IMF wringer one more time to
squeeze out the transferred purchasing power.
BUSINESS VENTURES IN RUSSIA INSURED BY U.S.
In 1990, the US. Export-Import Bank
announced it would begin making direct loans to Russia.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment
Corporation was providing free "insurance" to private companies that were
willing to invest in the ex-Soviet state. In other words, it was now doing
for industrial corporations what it had been doing all along for banks:
guaranteeing that, if their investments turned sour, the government - make
that taxpayers - would compensate them for their losses.
The limit on that insurance had been $100
million, a generous figure, indeed. But, to encourage an even greater flow
of private capital into Russia, the Bush Administration authorized unlimited
protection for "sound American corporate investments."
If these truly were sound investments, they
would not need foreign-aid subsidies or government guarantees.
What is really happening in this play is a
triple score:
-
International lending agencies provide
the Social Democrats with money to purchase goods and services from
American firms. No one really expects them to repay. It is merely a
clever method of redistributing wealth from those who have it to
those who don't - without those who have it catching on
-
American firms do not need money to
participate. Since their ventures are guaranteed, banks are anxious
to loan whatever amount of money is required. Efficiency or
competitiveness are not important factors. Contracts are awarded on
the basis of political influence. Profits are generous and without
risk.
-
When the Social Democrats eventually
default in their contracts to the American firms or when the joint
venture loses money because of socialist mismanagement, the federal
government provides funds to cover corporate profits and repayment
of bank loans.
There you have it:
The Social Democrats get the goodies; the
corporations get the profits, and the banks get the interest on money
created out of nothing.
You know what the taxpayers get!
By 1992, the wearisome pattern was clearly visible.
Writing in the New York Times, columnist
Leslie H. Gelb gave the numbers:
The ex-Soviet states are now meeting only 30
percent of their interest payments (and almost no principal) on debts to
the West of $70 billion... Various forms of Western aid to the ex-Soviet
states totaled about $50 billion in the last 20 months, and the money
has virtually disappeared without a trace or a dent on the economic
picture.1
1- "The Russian Sinkhole," by Leslie H.
Gelb, New York Times, March 30, 1992, p.
The interesting thing about this report is that
Leslie Gelb has been a member of the CFR since 1973.
Why would a CFR spokesman blow the whistle on
one of their most important Maneuvers toward The New World Order? The answer
is that he is doing just the opposite.
Actually he is making a plea for more loans and
more outright aid on the basis that the need is so great! lie advocates the
prioritizing of funding with first attention to aiding Russia's
nuclear-power facilities, agriculture, and industrial capacity. At the end
of his article, he writes:
"The stakes could not be higher. All the
more reason for substantial, practical and immediate aid - not for grand
illusions."
Congress hears and obeys. In spite of the fact
that all the preceding billions have "disappeared without a trace or a
dent," the transfusion continues.
In 1993 the World Bank advanced another
half-billion-dollar loan to Russia; before leaving office, President Bush
arranged for another $2 billion loan through the Export-Import Bank; and
Congress authorized hitting the voters with another $Z5 billion in foreign
aid earmarked specifically for Russia.
In July, at the Tokyo summit meeting of the
Group-of-Seven industrialized nations, another $24 billion was promised,
half of which will come from the IMF.
As this book goes to print, there is no end in
sight.
THE CONSPIRACY THEORY
A moment's reflection on the events described in this section leads us to a
crossroads of conscience.
We must choose between two paths. Either we
conclude that Americans have lost control over their government, or we
reject this information as a mere distortion of history. In the first case,
we become advocates of the conspiratorial view of history. In the latter, we
endorse the accidental view. It is a difficult choice.
The reason it is difficult is that we have been conditioned to laugh at
conspiracy theories, and few people will risk public ridicule by advocating
them. On the other hand, to endorse the accidental view is absurd. Almost
all of history is an unbroken trail of one conspiracy after another.
Conspiracies are the norm, not the exception.
The industrialized nations of the world are being bled to near death in a
global transfer of their wealth to the less developed countries. Is it being
done according to plan? Or is it an accident? It is not being done to them
by their enemies. It is being done by their own leaders.
The process is well coordinated across national
lines and perfectly dovetails with the actions of other leaders who are
doing the same thing to their respective countries. Furthermore/ these
leaders regularly meet together to better coordinate their activities.
Could anything that complex be accomplished by
accident? Or would some kind of a plan be required?
A spokesman from the IMF would answer, yes, there is a plan, and it is to
aid the less developed countries. But, after forty years and hundreds of
billions of dollars, they have totally failed to accomplish that goal. Would
intelligent people believe that pursuing the same plan will produce
different results in the future? Then why do they follow a plan that cannot
work?
The answer is they are not following that plan.
They are following a different one: one which has been very successful from
their point of view. Otherwise, we must conclude that the leaders of the
industrialized nations are, to a man, just plain stupid. We do not believe
it.
There is little room to escape the conclusion that these men and women are
following a higher loyalty than the self interest of their respective
countries. In their hearts they may honestly believe that, in the long run,
the world will be better for it, including their fellow countrymen. But, for
the present, their goals and their methods are not shared by those who have
placed them in office.
Under those circumstances, they must conceal
their plan from public view. If their fellow citizens really knew what they
were doing, they would be thrown out of office and, in some cases, might
even be shot as traitors.
Add all that together and it spells CONSPIRACY.
The only other explanation is that it's all accidental: no plan, no
cooperation, no goal, just the blind forces of history following the path of
least resistance. For some it will be easier and more comfortable to accept
that model. But the evidence speaks loudly against it. What is the evidence?
Not just the previous chapters, but everything that follows in this book.
By contrast, the evidence for the accidental
theory of history is - a blank page.
SUMMARY
The international version of the game called Bailout is similar to the
domestic version in that the overall objective is to have the taxpayers
cover the defaulted loans so that interest payments can continue going to
the banks.
The differences are:
-
instead of Justifying this as protecting
the American public, the pretense is that it is to save the world
from poverty
-
the main money Pipeline goes from the
Federal Reserve through the IMF/World Bank
Otherwise, the rules are basically the same.
There is another dimension to the game, however, that involves more than
mere profits and scam. It is the conscious and deliberate evolution of the
IMF/World Bank into a world central bank with the power to issue a world
fiat currency. And that is an important step in an even larger plan to build
a true world government within the framework of the United Nations.
Economically strong nations are not candidates for surrendering their
sovereignty to a world government.
Therefore, through "loans" that will never be
paid back, the IMF/World Bank directs the massive transfer of wealth from
the industrialized nations to the less developed nations. This ongoing
process eventually drains their economies to the point where they also will
be in need of assistance. No longer capable of independent action, they will
accept the loss of sovereignty in return for international aid.
The less developed countries, on the other hand, are being brought into The
New World Order along an entirely different route. Many of these countries
are ruled by petty tyrants who care little for their people except how to
extract more taxes from them without causing a revolt.
Loans from the IMF/World Bank are used primarily
to perpetuate themselves and their ruling parties in power - and that is
exactly what the IMF/World Bank intends.
Rhetoric about helping the poor notwithstanding,
the true goal of the transfer of wealth disguised as loans is to get control
over the leaders of the less developed countries. After these despots get
used to the taste of such an unlimited supply of sweet cash, they will never
be able to break the habit.
They will be content - already are content - to
become little gold-plated cogs in the giant machinery of world government.
Ideology means nothing to them: capitalist, communist, socialist, fascist,
what does it matter so long as the money keeps coming. The IMF/World Bank
literally is buying these countries and using our money to do it.
The recent inclusion of Red China and the former Soviet bloc on the list of
IMF/World
Bank recipient countries signals the final phase of the game.
Now that Latin America and Africa have been
"purchased" into
the New World Order, this is the final
frontier.
In a relatively short time span, China, Russia,
and the Eastern European countries have now become the biggest borrowers and
already, they are in arrears on their payments.
This is where the action will lie in the months
ahead.
