Part of a large haul of gold bars
plundered from Cambodia by the Golden Lily. This
haul was recovered in July-August 1996 from a site
West of Mindanao in the Philippines. They were
concealed in a tunnel 500 metres long and were stacked
one metre high. They lined the entire length of
the tunnel. In
all 100,000 bars weighing 12.5 kilograms each were
recovered. A subsequent assay report valued the
20-22 karat bars at US$150,000.00
each.
