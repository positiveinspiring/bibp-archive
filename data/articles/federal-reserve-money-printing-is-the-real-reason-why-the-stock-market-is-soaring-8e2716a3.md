You can thank the reckless money printing that
the Federal Reserve has been doing for the incredible bull market that we
have seen in recent months.
When
the Federal Reserve does more "quantitative
easing", it is the financial markets that benefit the most. The Dow and the
S&P 500 have both hit levels not seen since 2007 this month, and many
analysts are projecting that 2013 will be a banner year for stocks.
But is a rising stock market really a sign that
the overall economy is rapidly improving as many are suggesting? Of course
not.
Just because the Federal Reserve has inflated
another false stock market bubble with a bunch of
funny money does not mean
that the U.S. economy is in great shape.
In fact, the truth is that things just
keep getting worse for average Americans.
So quantitative easing has definitely not made
things better for the middle class.
But all of the money printing that the Fed has
been doing has worked out wonderfully for Wall Street. Profits are soaring
at
Goldman Sachs and luxury estates
in the Hamptons are selling briskly.
Unfortunately, this is how things work in
America these days.
Our "leaders" seem far more concerned with the welfare
of Wall Street than they do about the welfare of the American people. When
things get rocky, their first priority always seems to be to do whatever it
takes to pump up the financial markets.
When QE3 was announced, it was heralded as the
grand solution to all of our economic problems. But the truth is that those
running things knew exactly what it would do. Quantitative easing always
pumps up the financial markets, and that overwhelmingly benefits those that
are wealthy.
In fact, a while back a
CNBC article discussed a very interesting study from the Bank of England
which showed a clear correlation between quantitative easing and rising
stock prices...
It said that
the Bank of Englands policies of quantitative easing - similar to the
Feds - had benefited mainly the wealthy.
Specifically,
it said that its QE program had boosted the value of stocks and bonds by
26 percent, or about $970 billion. It said that about 40 percent of
those gains went to the richest 5 percent of British households.
Many said the
BOE's easing added to social anger and unrest. Dhaval Joshi, of BCA
Research wrote that QE cash ends up overwhelmingly in profits, thereby
exacerbating already extreme income inequality and the consequent social
tensions that arise from it."
So should we be surprised that stocks are now
the highest that they have been in more than 5 years? Of course not.
And who benefits from this? The wealthy do.
In fact,
82 percent of all individually held stocks are owned by the wealthiest 5
percent of all Americans.
Unfortunately, all of this reckless money
printing has a very negative impact on all the rest of us. When the Fed
floods the financial system with money, that causes inflation. That means
that the cost of living has gone up even though your paycheck may not have.
If you go to the supermarket frequently, you
know exactly what I am talking about. The new "sale prices" are what the old
"regular prices" used to be. They keep shrinking many of the package sizes
in order to try to hide the inflation, but I don't think many people are
fooled. Our food dollars are not stretching nearly as far as they used to,
and we can blame the Federal Reserve for that.
For much more on rising prices in America, see
the article "Somebody
Should Start The Stuff Costs Too Much Party".
Sadly, this is what the Federal Reserve does.
The system
was designed to create inflation. Before the Federal Reserve came into
existence, the United States never had an ongoing problem with inflation.
But since the Fed was created, the United States has endured constant
inflation. In fact, we have come to accept it as "normal".
Just check out the amazing chart
in the video posted below...
The chart in that video kind of reminds me of a
chart that I shared in a
previous article...
Not that I expect the United States to enter a
period of hyperinflation in the near future.
Actually, despite all of the reckless money
printing that the Fed has been doing, I expect that at some point we are
going to see another wave of panic hit the financial markets like we saw
back in 2008. The false stock market bubble will burst, major banks will
fail and the financial system will implode.
It could unfold something like this...
-
A
derivatives panic hits the "too big to fail" banks.
-
Financial markets all over the globe
crash.
-
The credit markets freeze up.
-
Economic activity in the United States
starts to grind to a halt.
-
Unemployment rises above 20 percent and
mortgage defaults soar to unprecedented levels.
-
Tax revenues fall dramatically and
austerity measures are implemented by the federal government, state
governments and local governments.
-
The rest of the globe rapidly loses
confidence in the U.S. financial system and begins to dump U.S. debt
and U.S. dollars.
I write about
derivatives a lot, because they are one of the greatest threats that the
global financial system is facing.
In fact, right now a derivatives scandal is
threatening to take down
the oldest bank in the world...
Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the worlds
oldest bank, was making loans when Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci
were young men and before Columbus sailed to the New World.
The bank survived the Italian War, which saw
Sienas surrender to Spain in 1555, the Napoleonic campaign, the Second
World War and assorted bouts of plague and poverty.
But MPS may not survive the twin threats of
a gruesomely expensive takeover gone bad and a derivatives scandal that
may result in legal action against the banks former executives.
After five centuries of independence, MPS
may have to be nationalized as its losses soar and its value sinks.
So when you hear the word "derivatives" in the
news, pay close attention.
The bankers have turned our financial system
into a giant casino, and at some point the entire house of cards is going to
come crashing down.
In response to the coming financial crisis, I
believe that our "leaders" will eventually resort to money printing unlike
anything we have ever seen before in a desperate attempt to resuscitate the
system.
When that happens, I believe that we will see
the kind of rampant inflation that so many people have been warning about.
