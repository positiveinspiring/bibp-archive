The North Korean government smuggled six nuclear
weapons into Japan to use as blackmail against the Japanese government,
according to a senior Japanese public security police source.
Five of the bombs have been seized by Japanese
authorities but the sixth is located in the basement of the headquarters of
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chosen Soren) and
police have been warned it will be set off if they try to seize it. The
discovery of the bombs by Japanese authorities confirms the original warning
about the North Korean plot to attack with Japan that from a KGB agent who
claimed to report directly to Russian Prime Minister Putin.
The nuclear blackmail is linked to a failed
Federal Reserve Board crime syndicate plot to start World War 3 on the
Korean peninsula in a bid to stave off bankruptcy.
The battle for control of the worlds financial system is now entering a key
phase. The latest news is that funds that have been blocked around the world
may be released either starting on October 15th (not likely) or after the
G-20 meeting due in North Korea in November, according to CIA, Japanese
security police and NSA sources.
However, despite the optimism from these diverse sources, there still
appears to be a major, unsolved power struggle raging beneath the surface.
Last week the
Obama administration sent feelers to the
White Dragon Society,
stating that,
Obama is now allied with the military and he has kicked the
Jews out of his government.
Michele Obama demanded that Rahm Emmanuel and
others be fired because of racist remarks made about her children (he
allegedly called them pikaninies), an NSA source says.
However, we very much doubt the military will
follow Obamas orders since he hired a lawyer with no military background to
head his National Security team after the departure of Marine General Jim
Jones. It seems that Obama, realizing he was about to be thrown into the
bus, decided to try to strike out on his own but he is probably in way over
his head.
In fact we have heard the 'Khazarians' have already put a sanction on Obama
meaning he is not expected to be long of this world. It may even be a public
Kennedy style assassination according to a senior US government source.
The fight in Washington still seems to be between the faction that wants to
replace Obama with Hillary Clinton and a group that wants an interim
military government under Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
Gates is in Vietnam now meeting his Chinese, Japanese and ASEAN
counterparts. We are still not quite sure what is being discussed but we are
sure the North Korean nuclear bomb in Tokyo is part of it. That bomb is
connected to North Korean spy Yasuhiro Nakasones desperate attempt to take
over the Bank of Japan.
This plot will fail since senior North Korean
operatives in Japan, including former Prime Minister Koizumi and so-called
right wing nationalist Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara have now been
identified. The North Koreans will need to start negotiating directly with
the White Dragon Society if they want to get anything.
BOJ governor Shirakawa will be resigning this month and is scheduled to be
replaced by deputy BOJ governor Hirohide Yamaguchi (this is not the same
Yamaguchi who was arrested with $134.5 billion in bonds in Italy last year).
Meanwhile, the Italian treasury police, working with
Daniele Dal Bosco and
the OITC have been trying to sell not only these bonds, but in addition $1
trillion in dragon family bonds as well as some Austrian and German bonds
they have also stolen.
The latest intelligence report on OITC head
Ray C. Dam is that he is fact a
Muslim born in Kurdistan who has no royal blood. Nor does he have the
university degrees he claims to have. The OITC also never had a UN charter
like they claim but rather they pretended to have taken over former
Indonesian President Soekarnos charter.
There is a lot of information that we are now receiving that we cannot yet
publish for a variety of reasons.
However, the overall impression to be gained
from the various information sources is that things are coming to a head
quickly. There will probably be some senior secret meetings in the coming
weeks aimed to ending the financial stand-off. Some important new secret
people with level 7 security clearance will be participating in
negotiations with their Asian counterparts.
No firm date has been set for the meeting yet.
