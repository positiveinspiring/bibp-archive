# To "Counter" Populism, Start by Taking Globalization's Discontents 
Seriously

The Brexit referendum and the U.S.
presidential election have offered clear examples of how emotion
and affect increasingly drive political behavior.
In both cases, resentment and anger
over unaddressed grievances, combined with fear and anxiety over
radical disruptions to the economy and national identity, won
out over reasoned arguments in favor of the status quo.
But emotion and affect don't disappear with the counting of the
ballots. Election victories always create euphoria among the
winners and despair among the losers.
The nature of President-elect
Donald
Trump's insurgent candidacy and his upset victory magnify both
reactions.
The election outcome calls into
question not only fundamental aspects of both of America's
political party coalitions but also, given the uncertainty
regarding Trump's foreign policy declarations during the
campaign, America's role in the world and, by extension, the
global order built upon it.
There are potential dangers in the reactions of both the winners
and the losers.
The euphoria of victory often leads
to overreach, making short shrift of the political capital
gained at the ballot box. And as most incumbents in Western
democracies can attest, the victor's popularity, which usually
spikes after the election, is often painfully short-lived.
This makes the despair felt by the losing side all the more
ill-advised. Proponents of the liberal international order are
right to be concerned and even alarmed.
Even if Trump walks back some of his
more iconoclastic positions or fails to successfully implement
them, the grievances that fueled his victory, and Brexit before
it, represent a significant challenge to the global order - and
they will not disappear.
To the contrary, Trump's victory is
a boon for like-minded politicians in France, the Netherlands
and across Europe. The impossible has now become possible, and
the inconceivable plausible.
Were either country to elect a
government led by populist nationalists, it would almost
certainly
spell the end of the European Union,
removing not only another pillar of the international order, but
the one most fundamentally aligned with the core American values
of democracy, pluralism and the rule of law.
Yet now that the shock of Trump's victory has worn off, resolve,
and not despair, must be the order of the day for those who
would seek to shore up the liberal international order. They
cannot hope to do so without reflecting upon why it now bears
the brunt of so much resentment and hostility.
Certainly, part of its current
unpopularity is due to the fact that it is an easy target to
blame for complicated phenomena.
Productivity gains and global labor
competitiveness, for instance, are more directly responsible for
job losses in developed industrial economies than is trade. And
some of the more spectacular successes of liberal
internationalism, such as
the dramatic reduction in global poverty,
have occurred far from the view of American and European
electorates.
But simply dismissing the popular uprising against the status
quo as ill-informed and misguided would be a mistake.
Politics is certainly about
explaining complicated phenomena, but the events of this year
should make clear that it is also about telling compelling
stories. And for now, liberalism's opponents are telling the
more compelling story.
To change that, liberal
internationalists would do well to craft a new narrative,
beginning with discarding the neoliberal ideology that coupled
market-driven prosperity with the inevitable triumph of
political liberalism.
After all, as cases from Russia and
China to Turkey and across Latin America and Asia have shown,
there is no law of nature that precludes market-driven
prosperity from going hand in hand with authoritarianism.
Now that the shock of
Trump's victory has worn
off,
resolve, and not despair,
must be the order of the
day
for those who would seek
to shore up the liberal
international order.
A new narrative justifying
liberal internationalism is needed, one based on a bottom-up
approach that begins by identifying the trends on the ground
that are shaping grievances and driving political behavior, and
then works backward to identify the changes necessary to
effectively respond to them.
This narrative would take into
account feelings as well as facts, propose projects as well as
policies, and offer purpose as well as process.
It would examine the pillars of the liberal order, with an eye
to striking new balances between its desirable aspects and the
challenges they now face. Balances are always only ever
tentative and fleeting in the grand scheme of history.
Some of the resentment on
display today is simply nostalgia based on the misreading of a
temporary moment of history - namely the postwar period of
prosperity - as a permanent condition of a bygone golden era.
But clearly the costs of
globalization's disruption have begun to outweigh the advantages
of its openness to a sizable enough population of voters that
new balances must now be found.
To begin with, balancing that openness with the popular call for
protective barriers will require more effectively addressing the
disruptions caused by liberalized trade and investment.
But it will also require
seriously tackling the challenges presented by mass immigration,
whose benefits for too have long blinded many advocates to the
cultural impact that massive influxes of immigrant populations
can cause. In some ways this horse has already left the barn,
particularly in Europe.
But ignoring the issue or
clinging to outdated ideological dogmas only plays into the
hands of populists who exploit it for electoral advantage.
Another new balance that must be struck is between the
multilateralism of liberal internationalism and the groundswell
of nationalism currently on display in the U.S. and Europe.
Clearly some issues require an
approach that transcends borders:
Indeed, how effectively these
challenges are handled is directly related to the current rise
of nationalism, because unless people feel fundamentally secure
within their own borders, they will look with hostility on
arrangements that require ceding sovereignty to unaccountable
global bodies.
But the rise of populism in the U.S. and Europe also signals a
growing skepticism toward the global roles of both places,
whether America's as the world's security backstop, or Europe's
as its safe haven for asylum-seekers.
Should both pull back from the
lead on these and other issues, as now seems likely, thought
must be given to how to fill the gap so that diplomacy, and not
military force, remains the default position for deciding on the
rules and norms of global governance.
This will be particularly
salient for guaranteeing human security in areas where it is
under threat and regulating the use of force in international
affairs to prevent a return to limited wars.
Finally, a new balance needs to be struck between the resurgence
of national identity and the emergence of global
cosmopolitanism, which in many ways is at the heart of the
current populist revolt.
That means treating questions of
national identity with more respect, without ceding ground on
the potential dangers that nationalism can present.
On some issues there can be no
compromise; bigotry and intolerance in all their forms can never
be countenanced. But so long as the discourse over national
identity is dominated by nostalgia for an imagined past, rather
than the opportunities of a shared present and future, the issue
will continue to benefit populists.
Perhaps more than anything else, liberal internationalists
should return to the core norms and values that anchor their
aspirations for an open and rules-based global order.
Defending liberalism and political
pluralism, human rights and dignity, and economic development to
better meet the needs of the planet's growing population all
make for a compelling narrative.
As a platform, it fits awkwardly
into the landscape of realist power politics most likely to
characterize a world given over to populist nationalism.
But it is one that liberal
internationalism remains well-suited to advance.
