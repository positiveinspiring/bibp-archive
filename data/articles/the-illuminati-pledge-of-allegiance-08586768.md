These guys do this type of thing in our faces all the time. Whether it's
with logos, slogans, hand and face signals or "crafted" occult references in
language, they love to signal each other.
And smirk.
One such phrase is the "thousand points of light" symbolism Magog
Bush the
Elder made famous during his campaign. Turns out it was
nothing new, as usual. The Illuminati have been up to their "school of
secrets" crap game for millennia and this is no new saying he coined.
They're sucking up to their slithery superiors.
Nice. If they only knew what awaits them.
Bill Gates - New Kid on the
Block Wants In
Of course Bill's been in since he was handed the Microsoft dynasty when
still a pimply teenager by his eugenicist insider Dad, co-founder of
Planned
Parenthood. Nice gig.
"I'm rich and connected and
get to decide who lives or dies. If the CIA wants my (MK) kid in on it,
let's do it."
Oh how many of these wicked bastards feel and
act that way.
With
Bill and Bilderberger Melinda operating this, it's bad enough calling
this the "decade of vaccines" with
the "Gates of Hell" Foundation brandishing
their Orwellian plan to electronically register every child to supposedly
keep track of their vaccines.
It's the follow up of
the globalist Agenda 21 ramp up surreptitiously
underway that's off the freaking charts.
The ultimate solution - look out for it and refuse it at all costs
Registration - The Blueprint
for the RFID
This "registration" program cited below is only one of Bill and Melinda's
many "benign" contributions to the global Illuminist agenda, but it's
wickedly significant:
"Vaccines
will be the key. If you could register every birth on a cell phone - get
fingerprints, get a location - then you could [set up] systems to make
sure the immunizations happen."
Gates suggested using cell phones to record each
birth and send the information, including biometric identifiers, to a
central database.
This database would then send reminders to
parents' phones when it was time to come in for vaccines or other
treatments. He said a prime location to implement such programs would be
northern Nigeria or northern India, where vaccination rates are less than 50
percent.
But here's the kicker
- Bill's Illuminati "shout out"
Acknowledging that registering every single birth has never been done
before, Gates said he'd like to see a birth registration system, and because
it's a new technology,
"we should let 1,000 new ideas blossom" in
order to make it happen.

Where have I heard that before?

commemorating Bush Sr.'s
occult call for a "thousand points of light"
or fright if you ask me.
Illuminist Imagery
It's no mere "coincidence" that
Gates' "1000 blossoming ideas" is similar
language to Bush's esoteric "1000 points of light" illumination reference.
And besides, who talks like that? "Let 1000 ideas blossom"... Sounds like some
ancient dynastic Chinese ruler or something. Sticks out like a sore thumb
as
it's supposed to. It's not just to signal them, but to subconsciously
program everyone listening.
Major clue as to how they operate at lower, occult levels on the human
psyche to prepare us for coming "revelations". Look for it.
But no doubt this is Bill announcing to the Illuminati brotherhood he's on
board with the program and happy to be the new point man in this eugenicist
vaccine push, amongst many other programs.
Dear old Dad taught, or programmed, him well.
"No worries, Pa and
brotherhood... I'm fully on board and the program's in full swing and
I'm here to do your bidding!"
La la lapdog...
And the world thinks
he's a
philanthropist
what a staged con job.
Bush Sr. - Satanic brandisher
of deadly "points of light"
the cold "Illuminated" plan
to take over and rule the world.
A Little Background -
Magog Bush's Points of Light
We first heard this evocation of this Illuminist imagery from Magog George
H.W. Bush in his inaugural address:
I have spoken of a thousand points of light,
of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout
the Nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging,
sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding.
We will work on this in the White House, in
the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are
the brighter points of light, and I will ask every member of my
government to become involved.
The old ideas are new again because they are
not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a
patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.

What a crock. Again, who talks like that?
And then in his State of the Union address:
We have within our reach the promise of a
renewed America. We can find meaning and reward by serving some higher
purpose than ourselves, a shining purpose, the illumination of a
Thousand Points of Light.

Coded Speech, Symbolic
Language
Drippy, I know. But occult references have power amongst the initiated and
he's speaking to his own.
George Bush was using symbolic language and was
referring to the body of Illuminati initiates. When
Bill Clinton
in his State of the Union Address was speaking about the "setting sun and then the
dawning of the new era" he was also using symbolic language.
This Points of Light smokescreen was a big deal in its day and still goes
on. This program branched out into a literal Points of Light Foundation to
curry sycophant volunteerism and later merged with the Hands On Network to
become the Points of Light Institute, of all things, back in 2007.
All to perpetrate the esoteric in your face "points of light" concept.
And the scam continues.
All on the same team.
Points
of light my foot.
Origins
Peggy Noonan supposedly penned those words, but who knows where this
really originated as it's clearly coded speech. One literary usage was in
C.S. Lewis' 1955 book "The Magician's Nephew".
C.S. Lewis wrote,
"One moment there had been
nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of light
leaped out
"
C.S. Lewis was known to be steeped in the occult
and well on board with the thrust of the Illuminist agenda.
Some say it traces back to our Masonic "founding fathers".

exposing the meaning of the
sun symbolism in history
Significance of the
"thousand points of light" and the New Dawn
The sun/points of light imagery is everywhere.
As the Illuminati believe they are the true
enlightened ones, they utilize it everywhere... flags, logos, emblems,
architecture... to mark their presence, their beliefs, and their plan for
world domination. But working it into verbal imagery has predominantly taken
these two forms, the points of light and the rising sun
or dawn of a new day.
And when they use these terms they are announcing something.
As many scholars know, the Illuminati readily utilize coded language to
convey plans to each other and try to brainwash the masses to accept their
goals. Now, what does the thousand points of light mean?
As early as September 1788, Freemasons George
Washington and Alexander Hamilton used the words "points of light."
The occultist
Alice Bailey [in her 1957 book "The
Externalization of the Hierarchy"] described the points of light
as the leaders of the occult group called the New Group of World Servers.
Bailey believed that the points of light and light groups were necessary in
building up the New Age.
Bailey believed that an invocation ritual was
needed in order for Light to exist among men.
This Light isn't the true Light of 'God,'
but a New Age 'false Light.'
Bush's words were used to establish his
allegiance to the Elite and condition citizens of this magical alchemy.

Philanthropic Eugenics
- Nice
As were
Bill Gates' words an announcement of his allegiance to the
Illuminati.
This central data base including every man,
woman and child, beginning with the newborn, under the guise of
"healthcare", and linking them to the central nervous system of the new
world order is the tie in to Microsoft.
But this is just one of the many
eugenicist programs he is sponsoring and lending what he thinks is his
clean-bean image.
Hardly.
All while working hand in hand with
Monsanto,
Big Pharma,
geoengineering firms and a host of other
corporations and think tanks to
bring
"controlled reduction" of humanity and
the crippling of our ecosystem.
And like wicked Bush Senior, he's cloaking the Illuminist agenda behind the
smokescreen of "good works" for the "underprivileged" of this world, going
after the defenseless children first.
Beware. Children have always been their primary target. But they're after
all of us...
So-called,
...is all part of a Trojan horse of
the worst order. As are all of their plans.
Beware
the Illuminist agenda. They've infiltrated just about everything.
Read their language, know their intentions. And tell others. Fear not. The
wicked elitist virus will soon be eradicated as their matrix of power
crumbles.
We just have to endure their death throes.
Until and beyond this coming calamity is done, be strong, be aware, be
vigilant...
