Surveillance drones have a new mission.
According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) they will be
used for public safety.
Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the DHS,
told a House Committee meeting on Homeland Security that the more than
30,000 drones that will be deployed into American skies are just arbitrarily
watching out for US citizens.
Napolitano
stated:
With respect to Science and Technology,
that directorate, we do have a funded project, I think its in
California, looking at drones that could be utilized to give us
situational awareness in a large public safety [matter] or disaster,
such as a forest fire, and how they could give us better information.
Secretly, DHS have been taking bid for
contractors who can install aerial remote sensing which uses light
detection and ranging (LIDAR) that would be part of the unmanned drone
missions within domestic US territory.
DHS believes these airborne images are
essential for homeland defense missions, such as,
-
planning for National
Special Security Events (Super Bowls or a national political conventions
come to mind)
-
enhancing border
-
port and airport security
-
as well as
performing critical infrastructure inventories and assessments,
...and has
spent over $50 million to employ
contractors, as well as processors for images and dissemination
throughout the DHS.
Coincidentally, the Federal Protective
Service (FPS) has been given the responsibility to protecting federally
owned property while preparing for civilian led riots expected in the near
future.
Part of the preparatory measures was an
order of 150 sets of riot gear that was
requested to be filled exponentially - within 15 days.
The items requested were:
-
147 Upper Body and Shoulder Protection
which are brand name or equal to Centurion Soft Shell Riot Control
System (CPX2500)
-
152 Thigh-Groin Protector brand name
or equivalent to Centurion TPX200
-
156 Forearm Protectors brand name or
equivalent to Centurion (FP100)
-
147 units of Hard Shell Shin Guards
brand name or equivalent to Centurion (TS70)
-
147 carry bags brand name or equivalent
to Exotech (E4), 147 tactical gloves brand name or equivalent to
Damascus (DMZ333)
-
147 riot helmets brand name or
equivalent to MaxPro (TR1000)
The FPS is anticipating that police or military
wearing the gear would encounter blunt force trauma to the upper torso, as
well as potential beatings with blunt objects.
To compliment these outfits, are required riot
helmets with tactical face shield equipped with liquid seals.
In addition, the US military are
ready to assist with local law enforcement
if called upon.
Five hundred military police and dogs will be allocated on civilian matters,
as reported by
mainstream media (MSM) have included the
reallocation of hundreds of military police officers being trained to
assist local authorities in investigation, crime scene and case building.
These same soldiers were just stationed in combat areas like Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the TSA have been patrolling trains stations and bus terminals in
California.
According to
one whistleblower:
Were doing patrols in the parking lot with
dogs, were even going as far out to the train station because the train
station is connected to the airport here and we have guys walking around
the train station, walking around the rental cars, were inspecting cars
coming into the parking garage, I mean weve fully expanded - were no
longer just at the gate and just at the security checkpoint.
The preparations that DHS and FPS are making for
civil unrest may be tied to Article 15 of the
UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).
This part allows foreign troops (preferably NATO
forces) to offer assistance in implementing the ATT. As the ATT does not
specify an adherence to the 2nd Amendment, but rather make
vague
definitions of who can own a gun, what type of gun and for what purpose, the
Constitutional rights we take for granted now will be stripped from us once
the ATT is signed.
To downplay the severity of our American right to bear arms against
tyrannical dictators foreign and domestic, President Obama stated at a
National Urban League meeting that:
We recognize the traditions of gun
ownership that passed on from generation to generation, that hunting and
shooting are part of a cherished national heritage.
I also believe that a lot of gun owners
would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the
hands of criminals. That they belong on the battlefield of war, not on
the streets of our cities.
Richard Schrade, attorney and member of
the Libertarian National Committee
commented on the 2nd
Amendment:
The Second Amendment was to protect the
ability of the people to violently overthrow the government. Lets
remember that this country was formed in a violent revolution.
Lets remember that at Lexington and Concord
citizen fired on and killed government soldiers sent by the central
government to confiscate their weapons and arms
When viewed in this
light, it is apparent that a limitation on automatic weapons would be an
infringement on the purposes of the Second Amendment.
Wayne LaPierre, vice president of the
NRA, has
called out Obama as being part of,
conspiracy to ensure re-election by lulling
gun owners to sleep. All that first term, lip service to gun owners is
just part of a massive Obama conspiracy to deceive voters and hide his
true intentions to destroy the Second Amendment during his second term.
LaPierre states that upon re-election, Obama
will be,
busy dismantling and destroying our
firearms freedom, erase the 2nd Amendment from the Bill of
Rights and excise it from the US Constitution.
