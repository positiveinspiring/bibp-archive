PROJECT SUPERMAN
A "VICTIM" OF THE ILLUMINATI'S
SUPER-RACE PROJECTS &
MONTAUK EXPERIMENTS SPEAKS OUT
I am trying to read it
but the words just seem to come out like blurs. I can't make out one
word. So I say "let me have my parents read over it and I'll mail
it back to you! what's your address?" That was the last straw.
The new Mr. Green starts to freak out and he says "I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT SAYS, IT SAYS THAT YOU GIVE US PERMISSION TO KILL YOU! I
REALLY DON'T GIVE A F*CK IF YOU SIGN IT OR NOT BECAUSE WE WILL JUST
SIGN YOUR NAME TO IT ANYWAY! SO SHUT THE F*CK UP AND SIGN THE DAMN
PAPER". I focus very had on the paper and the first few words say
some thing like I _____________ am of free mind and body do here by
freely consent.. Blah! Blah.. Blah. I said "this is wrong, I
don't freely consent". He rips the paper out of my hands and
hands it to someone off to my right. Within moments the paper is back
and my name is now on the paper. The new Mr. Green then gets a glass
of water and puts some white powder in it, mixes it up and tells me to
drink it. I ask "what's in it" and he pounds his fist on the
desk "JUST F*CKING DRINK IT". Adolph comes over my right
shoulder and tells me that it's poison and that it will kill me and I
WILL drink it. At first I wouldn't but then finally I drink the glass
of water. Almost instantly I "flash" to the healing pool and
this time my stomach hurts me so badly I cannot stand it. But I make
it into the green water.
Everything is very dark for a while. I feel like I am moving. This
goes on for a while and then it feels like we have stopped. All of a
sodden there is a dim light. I am in the trunk of a car. The men go to
pull me out and when I move on my own they literally jump back about
three feet. I get out of the car and simply ask "what's going
on?" The one man immediately gets on his portable phone and
starts yelling into it. "Do you want to talk to him, here"
and he hands me the phone. The man's voice on the phone sounds
familiar. For some reason they tell me to lay in the pine box at the
bottom of the hole and to go to sleep. I wake up and it is black, and
by black I mean a blackness that you can only appreciate if you have
been buried alive yourself. I hear dirt being thrown on top of me and
I start to scream.
I managed to bench press the lid only about an inch or so, but it was
enough for me to get my legs and feet up onto the lid. And I manage to
leg press the lid off and to the side about 6 to 8 inches. And I start
to try and dig my self out. This seemed to take forever and I took the
dirt that I had just dug away and stuffed in the coffin behind me by
my feet and I in a frantic panic proceeded to dig my way up. As I
break through the final layers the men are packing up the shovels in
the car and they are putting their shirt back on. As I pull my self
out of the earth the look of fear on their faces was evident. I could
smell the fear in the air and they knew they had done something
terrible and now were caught. Within moments I had broken both of
their necks and again sat right beside the bodies and began to cry.
This time when the phone rang I answered it.
"Hello?", I said. The voice art the other end said
"Who's this?" "Who's THIS.." I said, then I said
"Your friends are dead and I'm still alive" and threw the
phone into the woods. I was covered in blood and dirt, and I black
out.
The next morning I wake up in my bed and I am all cleaned up, except
there is a tremendous amount of dirt under my fingernails. Then there
was the meeting between myself and the man with the white hair. He
says to me "Andy, in Spain when a bull enters into the bull ring
he is facing certain death. There is no escape for him. However, every
once in a while there comes a bull that fights so valiantly that the
animal is sparred and he is put out to pasture to stud. We have
decided to put you out to pasture, and retire you. And I said
"You are going to put me out to pasture to graze but yet I am
still fenced in", and he looked at me and just laughed.
This is common practice as the "mind f*ck" if you will is
they tell you that you are out when that couldnít be farther from the
truth. It's just another layer of programming to erase your memory.
June-August 1990 - Working at dad's.
October 1991- Kidney stones.
February 1991- I am taking business law 102, in the spring of
sophomore year. During the first month of classes from professor
Shanahand (the business law professor in the Simon school of business)
Desert storm.
May 1992- I graduate from college and move home to start looking for a
job.
December 1992- I am working in Newark for an air freight company (near
Newark airport). On my way to work I am listening to Howard Stern's
radio show. He starts talking about this video tape he has of a kid
who is put on trial for supposedly taking steroids when he is in high
school. He says that this happened years ago but he wants this person
to call in. He wants to talk to me. At that moment I instantly break
into a cold sweat and my head starts spinning as I'm driving on the
garden state parkway. I get to work and Howard is still raving on
about this. I don't call. The next day he is calling me a coward and a
weasel for not coming forward because he wants to make me into a hero
or something (I told a lot of adults to "F*ck off,"
literally). He finds out who I am from the tape, calls me and tells me
he is sending a limo for me. I take tomorrow off. In the morning, the
limo arrives and I just cannot get myself to get in, and I send it
away. Howard calls and he is pissed and calls me all kinds of names.
In the afternoon, he calls me again and this time he is even more
pissed. He is frantic yelling at me about how the GOVERNMENT just
pushed there way in here, took the tape, and said that if he said one
more word about this that he is going to revoke their FCC license.
He of course talks about it on the radio the next day, begging me to
come forward and stand up to them. I cannot, every time I even try to
think about any of that stuff my head literally starts to spin. Then I
remember, Mr. Green and a group of men show up at my house, and erase
my memory again.
March 1993- My father discusses my future with me and what I want to
do. I told him that I never want to live up north again. Trying to
help, he calls his Navy buddy who owns a printing company down in
Atlanta. I interview and get the job. I move down to Atlanta to start
my new job and supposedly my new life.
July 1993- In my apartment complex, this guy unusually comes up to me
and introduces himself at the apartment complex pool. The guy's name
is Aaron and he is down South to get his masters degree in PSYCHOLOGY.
Coincidentally he is also from Rochester NY. And went to the
University of Rochester for 1 semester and supposedly knows some of my
friends as he is a "local" Rochester boy. He becomes my best
friend after a while and about a year goes by. When we would go out
drinking or be at parties Aaron would brag about being able to
hypnotize people without them even knowing it and how he could just
"f*ck" with people's minds. I never thought much about it. I
had absolutely no memory of any of my college horrors and frankly was
having the time of my life in Atlanta. He was also one of my
"best friends" so I never even considered or gave anything
else a second thought.
July 1994- The printing company didn't expand in terms of future
potential as I had hoped and I finally had quit after about a year and
a half (I think). I was unemployed for a while but then I got my first
corporate break. I get my first job with a major corporation (the
Dunlop tire corporation). Three hundred and sixty resumes for 1 spot
and I got the job. So naturally I was very excited and told all my
friends. The job involved traveling all around the Southeast every
week (being gone Tuesday through Friday, on the road, every week). The
job didn't start until late August and it was early July so I had some
time on my hands.
About two weeks after I told Aaron that I had gotten the job he calls
me and asks me to come over. I get to his apartment and we bullshit
for about an hour, he tells me out of the blue that "some people
are concerned about your new job". I was shocked and this really
came out of left field so I said "what the f*ck are you talking
about". He said "the fact that we won't know where you are
during the week" and I was just utterly confused and became
extremely pissed off (I still had no memory of any of the events, the
torture, the assassinations, the Illuminati, nothing) and I said
"What the hell are you talking about? Who is concerned? What
business is it of theirs anyway? Who? I don't understand?"
He let it go. What happened next he did not let go. I had all this
time on my hands and I was very nervous because I had to go to Buffalo
for three weeks of training. I was 24 years old and this was my first
"real job" with a company car, expense account and
everything. Ever since I came back from Munich Germany when I was 5
years old I stuttered severely when I spoke. The thing is I knew it
was all in my mind, because when I was alone I could speak very
fluently, but when I had to speak to anyone, read aloud or, heaven
forbid, speak to a group of people my entire throat would just
"lock up" and I could not speak word one. This was a serious
problem for me and needless to say I was tormented as a child. But
anyway, I decided that this was my first real job and if I wanted to
get anywhere in life that I will not let this stop me and it must be
fixed and now is the time.
I had never been to a hypnotherapist before but for some reason I
really believed in the power of hypnotism, and I really thought that
this along with my Silva mind control could really help me. So I open
the yellow pages and pick out a hypnotheripest. In the ad the
hypnotheripest claimed to be able to cure many different ailments
within a few sessions, stuttering was one of them so I called and made
an appointment.
I proceed to go into the appointment talk to the Doctor and explain
how I think my problem is all in my mind. He states that my
conclusions are "very interesting", and he puts me under.
When I opened my eyes the doctor's face was white as a ghost and he is
sweating bullets, there are now two assistants in the room and they
have the same horrific look on their faces. The doctor in a trembling
voice asks me "DID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF A GOVERNMENT
MEMORY CAP IN YOUR MIND?" I said "no, what are you talking
about?" He is still sweating profusely, and I ask him "what
is going on." He would not discuss it but he said he wanted to
see me tomorrow. I go to pay for the session in the lobby and I ask
the assistant "what happened in there?" At first she would
not tell me but I finally got it out of her. She said that I
absolutely FREAKED OUT and I was absolutely screaming uncontrollably.
She also stated that in her 15 years with this doctor she had never
seen anything like it. She said the doctor tried for 15 minutes to put
the cap back on and I would not let him, they had to get three other
people to hold me down and finally he got control of the situation
again.
This is on a Tuesday, the doctor wanted to see me the next day but he
was booked through Friday, the assistant made room for me to see him
on Thursday. I leave very confused, still having no clear memories as
to what's going on and no memories of any of the government
experiments or the Illuminati or the under ground bases. The thing is
I go home and what do I do, I go right over to my best friends
apartment (Aaron) and tell him the whole story about what happened at
the hypnotheripest and the memory cap. He starts to FREAK OUT,
"you went to a hypnotheripest, WHEN?" And let me tell you he
was PISSED!
I remember being very confused because I still didn't make the
connection. I remember going into his apartment, telling him what
happened, he gets very angry, but after that there was "lost
time." It was between 3:00 and 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon when
I went over there. I remember this because there were "soap
opera's" on the television when I was initially telling him my
story, when I left "Jeopardy" was on and it was becoming
dusk. It was about 7:30 in the evening. I leave his apartment and go
home, I found myself sort of wondering what happened? At home I empty
my pockets on the table (change, keys etc..) and I have the receipt
from the hypnotheripest. "Oh yea" I say, I'm supposed to see
him on Thursday, but I couldn't remember anything else.
I go back Thursday AND THE DOCTOR IS NO LONGER THERE! I MEAN HIS NAME
IS SCRATCHED OFF THE DOOR HE IS GONE, VANISHED, I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE
HAD NEVER BEEN THERE. There were four or five doctors sharing the same
office and there was simply a space where his name had been. I go in
and ask the receptionist where is doctor so and so, as hard as I try
right now to this day I just cannot remember his name, but I can find
my way back to where his office was. But anyway, I ASK THE
RECEPTIONIST WHAT IS GOING ON AND SHE TELLS ME TO PLEASE LEAVE AND DO
NOT COME BACK. I ask about the doctor, she closes the receptionists
window turns her back to me and walks away.
I go home, even more confused, Aaron calls me that night to come over,
I go, again not thinking anything about it. This is where all hell
breaks loose. I go to his apartment and we are sitting down talking as
usual. From the back bedroom six or seven men come out! Mr. Green and
a group of men are right there and I start freaking out. The other men
were dressed in black. The instant I saw these men I began to
remember, my instinct tells me to run but I was taken totally by
surprise. The men in black leap over the couch, grab and hold me. They
pined me against the back of the couch, I had no leverage to plant my
feet and try to get up. They start to laugh and say things like
"this guy isn't so tough" and "that was easy."
Mr. Green says "If you even had any idea how dangerous that guy
is you would not even be holding him!"
I remember looking at Aaron with a look of betrayal, I think I started
to cry, he could not look at me. Mr. Green says "do you have any
idea how much trouble you've been, we should have killed you a long
time ago." I start yelling "I'M GOING TO F*CKIN KILL
YOU!"
He asks Aaron if I am going to remember any of this. Aaron answers
"no". He then proceeds to punch me in the face and calls me
a "mother f*cker" or something. I am struggling to get up
but I just could not move, Aaron then takes over.
Aaron then says the "magic word." The first one didn't work.
It was hippa.. something or other. He tries another one
Poly-pop-er-enus , snarf-a-lif-agus, when he finds the right one
instantly I cannot move. He tells me how relaxed I feel, how warm and
safe I feel, how I am in a "happy place", to "lay back,
relax, smile." As I'm sitting there I cannot move, but I can hear
them laughing at me. He starts telling Mr. Green how he didn't know
what exact word they used but once you find it "that's it"
he is totally under your control.
This is where things start getting a little crazy. What he did to me
somehow, I remember, is he somehow locked me away in my own mind,
creating a multiple personality over mine to make me forget
everything. I remember fighting him for control in my mind. He told me
that I will do what ever he tells me to do. He said the walls are
closing in on you and you cannot fight it, in my mind I of course
pictured the walls closing in. On his instruction the walls closed in
until I was inside a "vacuum sealed steel coffin", which
conformed to the shape of my body (like a vacuum sealed produce
package only it was my body sealed in a steel coffin with only my face
showing). I could not fight it and I could not move. He then said you
are being sent to a place in your mind where you will never be found,
at this point I start screaming "no no no".
After he sent me to a place where "no one will ever find
you", he instructed that "a steel plate the size of ten
football fields and 10 feet thick is crashing down upon you" and
he said "here it comes, and there is no escape". I remember
screaming again as he says "boooom". Here comes another one,
"boooom", and he proceeded to do this five or six more
times. I am screaming during all of this. And I remember Mr. Green and
the others laughing at me while Aaron was doing this.
The thing is, the one thing I do remember about the hypnotherapist's
first visit is; I remember being back in my mind, "my safe
place" and off in the corner with these "steel plates"
or like a heavy iron with some weathering and rust around the edges.
Dust was all over them and they were bolted to the wall on an angle. I
remember hearing horrific cries coming from behind it, like some kind
of creature or monster. To investigate I imagined that the steel
plates were made of tin foil and instantly I had the strength to bend
them back one by one. I was scared. As I got to the lower layers I
hear scratching, like a wild animal clawing at a door to get out. The
last few layers were bubbled out like you can make dents in a sheet of
tin foil with your finger (only much bigger). Down in the corner,
there was a little piece that had been ripped aside, and you could see
the blackness behind it. I get on my hands and knees to get a closer
look, ALL OF A SUDDEN a hand of half rotted bone and flesh suddenly
reaches out and grabs my face. It would not let go.
I FINALLY GET AWAY FROM IT, but now the creature is suddenly energized
and begins to violently scratch and claw and with incredible force
starts ripping at the last layers of the steel. Finally, it made
itself enough of a space to get out. From the blackness emerges a half
rotted corpse, on it's arms, legs and left shoulder there was only
bone, no flesh. An image of a body that had been locked in a closet
for years, half rotted and half already dead. On the verge of insanity
from being trapped in a space so small you cannot move, yet you cannot
die. I am now slowly backing away from it.. It says "what are you
afraid of?" it asks. "Who are you?" I ask it, IT
ANSWERS "I AM YOU, DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF!" With a
burst of speed it leaps at me and grabs hold of me, like someone
trying to embrace me. With it's half rotted arms around me I start
screaming.
I believe that this is when I started flipping out in the doctors
office. The hypnotheripest was then trying to "cover it back
up" but the "self" that they had locked away was by no
means going to go back into that tiny space quietly by any stretch of
the imagination. That's why he had so much trouble getting control of
the situation again.
The hypnotheripest finally pulls me out of it, and two days later the
hypnotheripest has disappeared and Aaron had locked the
"monster" (it is no monster, it is my true "self")
away again, with new doors and in a new place. The monster who claims
to be the real me is even now locked away somewhere in my mind? This
concept is very scary and confusing but these are my memories.
August 1994 - June 1996- After that I didn't remember any of those
events or any other events for that matter until years later when a
single event "punched" a hole in the "alternate
reality", the "alternate personality" if you will, and
Aaron continued to be my "best friend" as he was my assigned
"controller" or "handler". Over the next two years
or so I would go over to Aaron's apartment, hang out all the time, and
we were buddies. The thing is, odd things would happen sometimes but I
would just dismiss them Because I had no recollection of ANY of the
past events. For example, sometimes Aaron would just get up and lock
the door. Right in the middle of a movie or something. It's only the
two of us and I am about 6 foot tall and 230 pounds with bodybuilder
physiques and Aaron is about 5'-10" and about 210 pounds with a
very muscular build, and he is living in a very quiet and secure
apartment complex. So I began to wonder about these events and I would
ask him "why do you sometimes get up and lock the door" and
he would never answer me, and I would never question it.
I remember a lot of missing time at Aaron's, watching a movie and all
of a sudden I would be watching a different movie and it is 2:00 in
the morning. All of a sudden I would realize what time it was and I
would say "Where the f*ck did the time go" and I would just
get up and leave. But thinking back I can vaguely remember all the
programming sessions he would have. He would keep trying to totally
destroy the "Monster" if you will, but he never could. I can
remember countless episodes of Mr. Green being there, as well as
others, studding me, trying to figure me out. But at the time some
things you really don't think about until later.
What was happening was they were watching all the time. I had no
memories about anything up to that point. My apartment was wired for
sound and video. Every moment of my life was being watched. One odd
thing about my life is, ALL of my girlfriends, at least all the women
I would consider calling my girlfriend, have said the same thing to me
at one point in time or another. They all told me that my apartment
was almost like a "hotel" room. I guess that when women
first start dating someone they like to get to know the person by
looking at all their "stuff." I had some of the nicest
"stuff" money could buy in terms of furniture and
electronics (a very nice furnished apartment). The thing is there is
no "memorabilia" at all, and thinking about it, they are
right! I have no photos at all! None of my parents, none of my family,
none of ANY college friends, NOTHING! No scrap books, no photo albums,
no souvenirs, no books at all, nothing personal of any kind. I have a
fully furnished apartment which is nicely decorated, but there is no
personal memorabilia of any kind. No memories and no past. (leave it
to the women to notice this)
Another funny thing is, Aaron took a job as a student counselor at
Life Chiropractic college in Atlanta. His favorite pastime was to
steal all of the college's video tapes which dealt with the human mind
and relating subjects from the Life college library. He must have had
20 different "sets" of tapes. These ranged from
documentaries to case studies of all the different mental diseases and
theories of how the human mind functions and what exactly occurs in
each of them. In fact, the more I think about it, ALL we used to do is
sit around and discuss how the human mind functions. He would say the
"Magic word" and I would sit there in my altered state of
reality and he would tell me his view of the mind. How the human mind
functions just like a basic computer. With every decision either being
"yes" or "no" answer, like a switch which is
either "on" or "off", and would discuss how every
memory, function, and action we had or did is basically a string of
yes or no responses. "Like a long combination lock you must have
the exact code to get 'In' he said. We would watch video after video.
Then I would tell him how I thought the human worked and functions. We
would spend hours upon hours discussing this.
Over the years the two of us would sit and he talk about "How to
mind f*ck" someone. The basic concept is to build a
"Platform over your real consciousness, and that then becomes
your real consciousness." And all along this was already been
done to me and I had no clue about any of it. Which in itself is a
very scary concept. A fake reality if you will. Sort of like Windows
95. Windows 95 is basically a "platform" built over the DOS
program to make the PC applications more "User friendly",
where all the computations, and all the "essence" of the
program is written in code using DOS, but all you see on the screen is
Windows 95 (like a platform built over the essence of the computer).
It's kind of funny, in a very sick sort of way. Here we I am sitting
around discussing how to mind f*ck somebody, for years, with my best
friend. When all along, I've already been "mind f*cked" by
him for years, and don't have a clue about any of it. He discusses it
with me just like it's normal conversation! Now that's a real
"mind f*ck" if you think about it!
What was happening was all during my time in Atlanta they were using
me for all sorts of different experiments at the Dobbins Air Force
Base in Atlanta where a "major" project had become active. I
was also used in the Montauk chair for the time travel experiments at
this time.
July 1996- My girlfriend, Pilar, is going to declare chapter 7 due to
her debt load from past bills. I had lent her some money, and she
wanted to pay me back by paying for my car repairs at the local Toyota
dealership. I needed a new muffler, power radio antenna, timing belt,
and tune up. About $1,200.00 worth of work which she was going to
charge on her credit card before she had to cut them up because of the
chapter 7. The dealership tells me it's going to take only one day and
I'll be able to pick it up in the morning. They give me a rental car
to drive around.
The next day I go back to pick it up and it's not ready. I go back the
third day and it's still not ready. I call on the forth day
(Saturday), and they tell me it won't be ready until Monday.
"Look", I said, "I used to be in the car business and I
know that your service department can crank out between 75 and 200
cars a day, why the f*ck is mine taking a week when you told me it
would only take one day?" And he says "we had to order parts
and it will be ready Monday!" And rudely hangs the phone up on
me. Monday comes and I go to pick up the car. I get the bill and it's
gone from $1,200.00 to $1,750.00. I'm furious, mainly because I didn't
know if the credit card was going to go through at $1,700.00+, and I
would really be stuck. And let me tell you I get in the guys face and
start freaking out, "You have the balls to keep my car for a
whole week and then bill me $600.00 over the estimate, where is the
manager etc..etc.." He replies "we had to order some
parts" "What parts" I say. He gets the paper work,
looks through it and says "we had to special order your radio
antenna" I say "special order the radio antenna, IT'S A
F*CKING '92 TOYOTA CAMRY! Your telling me that not one store in
Atlanta had a power antenna for a Toyota Camry for a whole week! The
entire city is sold out, that's BULL SHIT!" He then gets is my
face and says to me "I know who you are, and we don't want your
kind here. I'll take $100.00 off the bill, but don't come back because
we don't want your business or your "dirty" money
here!"
"WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" I answer. "We
had a visit from some of your "friends" and they told us all
about you, you piece of Shit drug dealer". "WHAT THE F*CK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" I say again. "I spit on guys like
you, dealing drugs to kids, I should kick your ass right here and now.
Don't worry you'll get yours someday, sooner than you think." He
says. I said "look I have no idea what you are even talking
about!? He says "pay it, and get the F*CK out of here and don't
come back."
I pay the $1,650.00, the credit card goes through. Pilar says
"what the hell is he talking about?" I said "I wish I
knew". We leave, she drives her car back to work, and I ride
around for a while. I'm still pissed off. This is too freaking weird!
About an hour into my "ride", I have an idea! I drive back
to the dealership and pull into the "Pep Boys" auto parts
store located next door to the Toyota dealership I had my car serviced
at. I go in and ask the guy at the counter, who also happens to be the
manager, if they do any business with the Toyota dealership next door.
He says "are you kidding me, they are our largest account".
"Oh"! I say. "I'm looking for a power antenna for my
car" I say. He asks "what year, and what make?"
"'92 Toyota Camrey" I tell him. He punches it up on the
computer. "Yes" he says and starts back to go get it.
"Sir can you tell me how many you have in stock" I ask. He
looks at the screen "53" he answers, "why" he
asks. "I was just curious because I was in two days ago and the
clerk told me you were out of them." "That's
impossible" he says. "You see this little "*" next
to the part number, it tells me that on this particular part we sell
so many of them that, if we ever go below a dozen in stock the
computer in the warehouse automatically ships us more and we would get
them the next day." "Thank you" I say, and leave.
Someone, (the Illuminati, the Nazi party, and United States government
are the people responsible for all of this as well as the torture at
the University of Rochester, as well as the assassinations) told the
Roswell Toyota dealership of Atlanta Georgia that I was a drug dealer,
so they could keep my car an extra 6 days to special order me a new
radio antenna???????? This one blew my mind for a long time because I
still had no idea what the hell was going on!
February 1997- Aaron informs me that he is going to have to leave
Atlanta for at least a year and that all he can tell me is that it's
"family related." He says it won't happen until late May or
early June. I'm very sad to hear that my friend is going away. He not
only is my best friend but he is also very involved in my business and
everything that I do. We try and work out something to where he can
still be involved and run things from his father's house in Rochester.
I knew it wouldn't work, he was quite insistent that it would. He
keeps reassuring me not to worry because he WILL be back in a year.
All along I am asking him "What's going on?" Finally, with
me swearing under strictest confidence that I won't tell anyone, Aaron
proceeds to tell me that what has happened is this; His father used to
work for a very large corporation in Rochester, and years ago he gave
his father the idea that he could sue this company for "mental
anguish" or that the stress of his job caused him to somehow
"snap" causing him to be mentally insane, and now he is
suing them. Aaron then tells me that what HE did, was to instruct his
father exactly how to answer all of the physiological tests and
questions that they were going to ask him, and basically showed him
how to scam thousands of dollars out of the company in the lawsuit.
Three years later, Aaron's father won, and was awarded several
hundreds of thousands of dollars. But what happened was, the Judge
ruled that Aaron's father was to receive the settlement, however since
he was "mentally not all there" he was not going to give
control of the money to him as it had to last him for the rest of his
life as he was no longer able to work. So the judge was going to set
up some kind of "trust" account where someone other than
Aaron's father must act as the executor of the account and therefore
be the one who actually distributes the funds since he was
"mentally incapable".
So, since Aaron's parents are divorced, and no one else in the family
knew that the whole lawsuit was all a lie, Aaron had to go home to act
as the executor for his father. And it had to be for at least a year
because the money was supposed to last his father for the rest of his
life since he is no longer able to work.
So they couldn't just pull it all out at once because the insurance
company for sure would be watching them. My girlfriend, Pilar, kept
wanting Aaron to hypnotize her to see if he could clear up some of the
past trauma she had experienced with her x-husbands. He always talked
about how he could hypnotize people without them even knowing it, and
she wanted him to do it to her, but ONLY if I was there. She didn't
trust him enough to do it on her own. For some reason he wouldn't do
it. He would say "I don't think that's a good idea" and
would always put it off. But yet I remember going to Aaron's one night
with Pilar, and it was one of those "missing time" nights
where I remember just staring off onto space for a while. The next
night I go over again, this time by my self.
Aaron says something very strange to me. He says "man, you have
nothing to worry about with Pilar, she absolutely idolizes you",
'trust me' on this." How the hell would he know? I ask myself
later. Months later, when I put it all together, I think he did it to
see if I had told Pilar about his father, good thing I didn't.
One Friday night I'm at home and Pilar is coming over later to watch
some movies. I'm feeling very up tight about my business and how it's
not going as well as anticipated. All along and for as long as I could
remember I always felt like some thing wasn't right with me. Like some
thing was "wrong" but I just had no idea what it was or
where this feeling was coming from. ALL OF A SUDDEN I REMEMBERED THAT
I KNOW SILVA MIND CONTROL! I had totally forgotten about it. Like out
of the blue it was like a revelation. I guess I just hadn't thought
about it for years. So I relax, and go to my level. I'm having a great
session, feeling totally relaxed and comfortable. I open my eyes and
Pilar is sitting on the floor next to me with this look on her face
like she is seeing the devil possessing someone. I ask her how long
she has been there? She says to me "What the hell were you
doing?" And I tell her all about the Silva method and about going
to different "Levels" of your mind. She says to me "you
never told me you could do that!". "I FORGOT I COULD" I
say. I asked her if I looked funny, and she tells me that she almost
freaked out when she saw me. "Why?" I asked her. "Your
eye balls were flurrying left and right at a million miles an hour. I
thought you were possessed or something. Then I called your name and
you wouldn't answer. So I sat down and watched." "How long
were you watching me" I ask. About 15 minutes she answers. What
does she say next? "TEACH ME". So she downs three glasses of
wine and we spend the rest of the night doing Silva mind control.
What happened, however, is that the next time we went to Aaron's
apartment, Pilar, wanting to be involved in some of the intellectual
conversations Aaron and I had, starts talking about how I taught her
the Silva method and how she went down to the different levels of her
mind and the whole thing. The next day I go over to Aaron's to watch
movies, I remember him getting up and locking the door. AFTER THAT
DAY, AND TO THIS DAY I CANNOT GO TO MY LEVEL. IN MY MIND, I JUST
CANNOT PICTURE AN ELEVATOR SHAFT IN MY MIND. I TRY AND I TRY BUT I
JUST CANNOT DO IT FOR SOME REASON. I guess Aaron didn't like the idea
of me romping around in my own mind and somehow "rigged it"
so that I cannot enter. It's sort of like being locked out of your own
mind. Very scary! March 1997- WHAT WAS THE "EVENT" THAT
TRIGGERED THE RECALL OF MY MEMORY? HERE IT IS. Aaron is a 5'-10"
muscular, balding Italian man, who, if he could, would spend his
entire life walking around in his "flip flops" with a short
sleeve shirt unbuttoned down to his belly button and in a baggy pair
of shorts hanging out at the pool all day everyday. We would still do
things like go to concerts, the home depo, occasionally a movie.
Things like that but nothing that ever required too much planning or
usually too much physical effort (except working out). One rainy march
evening I get to Aaron's, and he has a sudden burst of energy and
decides that he wants to go BOWLING. "Bowling" I say. As it
turns out, Aaron is an avid bowler. He even has his own ball (which he
stole form a bowling ally in Rochester NY). No bag, just the ball. He
says he hasn't been in a long time and he somehow got a "wild
hair stuck in his ass". This was a big venture for him because
Aaron actually had to go into his closet and dig out his sneakers and
a pair of jeans to go to the bowling ally.
We go, we walk in and get our lane and our shoes from the front desk.
We turn to the left and start walking to our lane. As we walk, the
lanes are on the right and the pro shop and bar is on the our left.
Aaron is ahead of me, about 3 steps (the fastest I have ever seen him
walk, I guess he was excited to be bowling or something). As we walk
we pass the door to the pro shop there is a life size cutout of a man
in a rhinoceros suite. He is standing there holding a bowling ball
(it was a very elaborate life size 3-dimential marketing display with
a real bowling ball in the guys hands). The display said something
like "Bowl with the best, Bowl with what the professionals use,
Bowl with 'RHINO BALLS'."
And as I walk by I start laughing. "BOWL WITH RHINO BALLS" I
yell ahead of me. AND THEN IT JUST CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH. I DON'T KNOW
WHY, BUT I SAID IT "THEY USED TO CALL ME 'THE RHINO' ONCE!"
and Aaron drops his bowling ball and IMMEDIATELY AND I MEAN
IMMEDIATELY turns around, walks back and gets right in my face and
says "WHEN DID THEY CALL YOU 'THE RHINO', WHEN DID THEY CALL
YOU 'THE RHINO'! WHAT GOT ME WAS HE SAID IT TWICE. I was caught off
guard by his actions and I blurted out "In high school" I
said. They used to call me "the rhino" in high school, it
was my football nickname. I will never forget the look in his eye as
he was examining me, studying me. The thing is I LIED, they NEVER
called me "the Rhino" in high school. "The Rhino"
was actually a friend of mines "nickname" and he was on
another team. My "nick name" in high school was "B
A" for "Bad Ass".
The moment after I said "They used to call me "the Rhino."
What "popped" into my mind was not some high school football
game. What "popped" into my mind was ME, STANDING ON A ROOF
TOP, LOOKING DOWN, AND YELLING AT THE MAN WITH THE WHITE HAIR
"BECAUSE I'M WEARING MY Nike's", AND THEN I WATCH AS HE
TRIED TO CLIMB THE WALL THE WAY I JUST DID. HE COMES REAL CLOSE (COMES
UP 3-4 FEET SHORT) AND SLIDES BACK DOWN. AND AS HE SLIDES BACK DOWN,
I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT HIS FACE, RIGHT IN HIS EYES. AND HE IS LOOKING
RIGHT INTO MINE. AND I REMEMBERED THE GIRL THEY HAD JUST KILLED WHEN
THEY RAN HER OVER. But that was it. Each of those memories were about
5 seconds long and somehow I knew there was more but I just couldn't
put my finger on it. But I had punched a hole in their "alternate
reality" and some memories had dripped through.
THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT IT BACK! A PROFESSIONAL BOWLING BALL. WHO'S BRAND
NAME IS "RHINO", THE "RHINO BALL", THAT WAS THE
EVENT WHICH TRIGGERED MY MEMORY. THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBERED, THE MAN
WITH THE WHITE HAIR, JUST AFTER THEY RAN OVER THE GIRL.
I lied to Aaron not out of fear. It just flew out of my mouth. I
didn't even think about it. I just told the story about it being a
high school "nick name". As we began to bowl, I could tell
Aaron was not himself, nervous, anxious, and he asked me about
"the Rhino" again and again. "Are you sure that's when
they called you "the Rhino?" He asks.
As I'm about to bowl I turn to him and say "Pretty f*cken sure
asshole! Watch this," and I pictured myself throwing a strike, I
start on my approach and I whizzed that ball down the lane and I threw
a strike. I had just taken a crash course in acting. Because I lied
again. At that point what was going through my mind was the girl, the
man with the wooden blocks, the trial, Brian talking to Mr. Green, the
lab. And as I'm bowling all these things are rushing into my mind.
"Put it out of your mind" I say to my self. "Think
about it later" and I played it down. I got away with it because
I hadn't made the "Aaron connection" yet so I wasn't in the
least bit nervous. I honestly just wasn't going to tell my best
friend, out of the blue, that the Rhino was the term they used to call
me when I was back in college and involved with the government, and
mind control experiments, and how I was a unstoppable super assassin
who possessed superhuman abilities! That would fly over like a lead
balloon. So I kept it to my self.
We bowled several games and consequently drank several pitchers of
beer. As we left and drove back to Aaron's he asked me to come in,
several times. I said "nah man, I'm beat, I'll call you in the
morning." He pushed it to the point to where I said something
about it. "What's wrong with you man? I'll call you in the
f*cking morning." And I managed to play it down again because I
wasn't afraid of Aaron. That night, I didn't literally sleep at all
(and I really haven't slept a single night since and it's been over a
year). As I sat on my couch and thought about the "Rhino
ball" I remembered being on the roof again. Then I remembered the
girl. I then back tracked to the parking lot, running up the stairs,
the girl, the roof, the jump. Going back that night and seeing the men
in yellow, going back in the morning. Brian and the steroids. Him and
Gwen, the lab, everything! But the memories are all like a 5 second
flash of a 10 minute movie all with no sense of time order. Clear but
then suddenly stops and it's all very confusing.
I'm even so clueless and lost in confusion that I ask Aaron
"Aaron, did you ever have any Army men over your apartment?"
He of course wants me to immediately come over. I go, we hang out, I
watch some TV, I come home and go to bed. As a mater of fact "I
have a very pleasant evening." In the morning, as I sit on the
couch on the coffee table there is a legal pad with all kinds of stuff
written on it in my hand writing. The Rhino, Rochester, 90 degree
vertical climbs, DID AARON LOCK THE DOOR??? WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU DO AT
AARON'S? CAN YOU REMEMBER? At that moment is when it all came
together, but still it was only as clear as a dream, only it was a bad
dream and I was awake.
I start thinking about college, and the thing is I couldn't remember
college, I didn't remember most of my life now that I thought about
it. I remember being at the University of Rochester, but the more I
thought about it, I couldn't remember anything specific. I don't sleep
at all now, and more strange things start happening.
The next night it is 3:30 in the morning and I'm up thinking about all
this. I see head lights illuminating some of the parked cars in the
parking lot, but after they were on for about five minutes. So I go
out onto my porch to see what is going on. There is a full size puck
up truck parked in front of the Bell South phone box which is the main
board for the whole complex (a big gray thing about 4 feet high and 5
feet wide). A man has the box OPEN and is doing something while the
pick up truck is left running. What exactly he is doing I have no
idea, but the whole thing is making me extremely paranoid. I think to
my self "for God's sake Aaron has the key to my apartment."
So for the next three months I would lay my golf clubs between the
front door and the closet door to act as a "wedge" so if
anyone tried to get in while I was sleeping the front door would only
open about three inches.
The next day I decide to call my father from a pay phone. And let me
tell you NOTHING is ever really real, until you tell your parents. I
gather my courage and I call my father. I ask him "Dad, Do you
remember going to Annapolis?", and he answers "Only when I'm
awake! Why?" "Because I don't remember college I answer.
"I have memories of attending the University of Rochester, but I
don't remember being there!" I then proceed to tell him the whole
story about the mind control experiments, the girl who was run over,
the lab, everything but it's all in bits and pieces. I said
"either I have just gone totally insane or my entire life since
the 6th grade has all been a lie. Either way I need to get some
serious physiological help!" He has become quite serious now and
says "I'm extremely glad that YOU said that!"
Through a friend of a friend I get the name of a good psychologist, he
subsequently works with a psychiatrist, as it turns out I start seeing
both of them.
Aaron is aware that I am seeing a psychologist, he is very interested
in what medication the doctor has given me and what is going on. I
tell him that I am going for therapy for the government mind control
thoughts going on in my head. He follows very carefully what's going
on and is satisfied with the fact that the doctors think that I am
either "crazy" or "chemically imbalanced" and they
don't believe me.
For the next several weeks I remember going over to Aaron's apartment
and there was a lot of missing time. What I would do was leave notes
to my self. One on the car seat, and one on my bed. Both saying the
same thing: Did Aaron lock the door? REMEMBER Rochester, the lab
experiments, Aaron is controlling you REMEMBER!!! And I would sign it
to my self. As I would get into my car after going over to Aaron's to
watch movies I would find this note in my own handwriting on the seat
and I would read it and I became even more confused.
But from somewhere inside me I would somehow never let go of the few
memories that had broken through and every time that I would read the
note it would somehow bring it back.
After a while Aaron found out about the note I was leaving to my self
in the car because he kept on asking me (when he had me in the trance
and I was under his control) how the hell I keep getting out. And I
would be forced to tell him. The thing is, I would only tell him what
he asked me. So since he never asked about the "other" note
I was leaving to my self on my bed I never told him. And this game
went on for weeks. After every night I would come home and try and
piece it back together again. As the weeks went by I finally put the
Aaron connection together, but I had to play along like there was
nothing wrong. But what happened was that Aaron eventually found out
that I knew in my real and daily life what he was doing to me. He
tried to keep plugging the holes in the dam (if you will) but my
subconscious would not be stopped, it was fighting to come out and
there was nothing that he could do about it. We had a falling out and
didn't speak to each other from that moment on. I believe that Aaron
knew that I knew that he knew that I knew and we simply stopped
talking to each other for the final six weeks that he was in Atlanta.
Mostly because he feared for his life that he could no longer control
the memories that were coming back to me.
May 1997- Aaron finally leaves to go to help his father, and never
said good by, he just left. Which only reinforces my suspicions.
July 1997- After about 18 weeks, thousands of dollars, and two
different "sets" of psychologists, and psychiatrists. The
third psychologist I go to, who was referred from the second one after
he said "I have no idea how to help you or what to do with
you!" because I was not "chemically imbalanced" and in
spite of all of the drugs and attempts to simply make these
"memories" simply go away he referred me to another doctor,
and he was vice a president of the psychology department at Emory
University hospital in Atlanta. The third guy finally had a good idea.
He says to me with a very egotistical demeanor "If you believe
that your problem can all be solved using hypnosis why are you here in
my office?" I laughed and thought about it and said "you
know, your GOD D*MN RIGHT!" I got up and walked out of his
office.
All along, my parents, especially my mother are very very concerned
for my well being. My mother especially seems to want to know EXACTLY
who I am seeing, and EXACTLY what medications they are prescribing to
me. And of course I tell her as she is threatening to come down and
stay at my apartment until I get through this.
August 1997- On the second, I had made arrangements to go and see a
hypnotherapist. For the initial appointment I had inquired as to if he
had ever heard of the Silva mind control method, and he responded that
he did and "was even aware of the technique and was fluent in
it's applications." I specifically did not mention anything about
the government or the experiments. When I went in with Pilar, all I
told him was that for some reason, that I, no matter how hard I tried,
could not go down to my level using the Silva method. I didnít know
why but I thought it was just because I was under a lot of pressure at
work or something. He tries to put me under and I keep for some reason
coming out of it. He said "this is like trying to keep a rubber
duck at the bottom of a tub of water when all it wants to do is keep
popping back up to the surface." He then gave me his professional
opinion. This is what he said "the mind is a funny thing, and we
are not even close to begin to under stand it. Of all the functions in
the mind, 95% of what occurs, occurs in the unconscious, and only 5%
of the mind functions in the conscious. There is DEFINITELY something
blocking you in some way. What's happening is this, your unconscious
is what really controls your mind. I suspect that something happened
in your past, something that is so agonizingly painful your
unconscious JUST WILL NOT let it come to the surface. Like a
"clenched fist" it will not let it go. At that point I knew
that he knew I was lying about why I really came to see him. He was a
nice guy and I liked him, but I had already made my plans to move back
home, so I didn't want to get started with a new "therapist"
and then have to start all over again when I moved, so I never went
back to see him. He didn't even charge me for the session.
August 18th- My roommate from college and one of my best friends is
getting married in Oswego NY. I flew into Newark NJ and drove up to
upstate New York. Oswego is located about 50 miles or so North of
Syracuse, with all this going on in my head I didn't make a plane
reservation until the week before. The airlines wanted $1,200.00 to
fly into Syracuse directly so I flew from Atlanta to Newark for
$199.00 and borrowed my mothers car and drove up. It was good to see
my friends and we had a great time. On my way home, since I was
already up there I got on the New York State thruway and went to
Rochester as opposed to coming directly home, more specifically the
University of Rochester. I was only going to one place and one place
only. The building where I scaled the wall and the girl was killed.
The building where I remember seeing men in yellow suits working at
3:00 in the morning "fixing" everything. The building where
I went back in the morning and found the crack in the block, and where
the railing had been replaced with a "new" one but the
cement was a different color.
I get there and let me tell you my heart was pounding. I go to the
building and look at the bottom block where the car had hit the
building. AND LET ME TELL YOU, THE CRACK IN THE BLOCK IS STILL THERE,
AND THE ONE RAILING IS STILL BEING HELD IN PLACE BY DIFFERENT COLOR
CEMENT JUST AS I REMEMBERED IT! October 30th 1997- I move back home
and start to look for people with similar experiences or who I think
can really "help me". I arrive in the afternoon (as I had
drove through the night), we unloaded the truck and I went to sleep.
The next day my Mothers friend Astrid follows me over to the local
u-haul facility, asks me how I feel, and I told her that I feel 'fine'
but thanks for asking.
Over the next month I am trying to piece together the fragments of my
memory. I got to the High school and start to ask questions. The
coaches all of course remembered me but the strange thing is when I
asked them about the steroid trial they all said the EXACT same
answer. They all seemed to get this glazed look in their eyes and they
all said word for word "I remember something about that, but I
just can't put my finger on it!" All the people who I know were
there all seemed to get the same funny look in their eyes. I try and
talk to my mother about what I am remembering and the thing is
everything and anything that I would say her response would be
"ANDY, THAT NEVER HAPPENED". Even simple things like when I
got into trouble as a kid when my parents were going through their
divorce, where I went to school in Germany, the fights my parents used
to get into when they going through their divorce. "ANDY, THAT
NEVER HAPPENED". So I began to cross check events with my father
and the rest of my family and they remembered most of the events as I
did. This did not make ANY sense. So I stopped discussing it with my
mother, and secluded my self in the basement of her house.
I went to see Father Jack and asked him about the steroid trial and
his response to me was "Andy, that never happened. We would never
allow that to happen. I strongly suggest that you donít say another
word to ANYONE about ANY of this and I strongly suggest that you
forget that you even think that it happened." This really pissed
me off, because I know that I am not crazy but what the hell is going
on around here. So I tell Father Jack that I am going to call Dr. Purrizzo and ask him about and of course Father Jack tries his
absolute best to convince me not to talk to ANYONE.
So if course I call Dr. Purizzo and get his service at his office as
he is on vacation in California. So I tell his nurse that I want to
leave a message for Mrs. Purrizzo (as she was the one who was caring
out her sexual fantasies on me with her friend back when I was in High
School, and was the one who would come up to visit me at Rochester and
try and get me to sleep with her) and if anyone would remember it
would be her.
The next day Mrs. Purrizzo calls me and I just ask her if she
remembers me and if she remembers going to Rochester at all. She
informs me that her memory (conveniently) has gone since she has had
alstimerzse disease. But she remembers me from when she went to see
her son play football against the University of Rochester but that was
it. This was impossible since I wasn't playing football when her son
(who was playing for Carginee Melon) played the University of
Rochester. The next day I get a call from Dr. Purrizzo who is calling
me from California while on his vacation. And he says to me "This
better be good" and I started to ask him in a very nice and
gentile tone about the steroid trial and he starts to laugh at me
calling me insane and that I need to have my self checked into a
mental clinic. So I ask him about when I worked at the Ho-Ho-Kus Inn
for him parking cars and how he hypnotized me and put me on the table
to try and find out if I was sleeping his wife and to get revenge for
ruining him at the steroid trial. He stated laughing at me again (and
I could hear Mrs. Purrizzo and a few other people laughing in the
background) and he tells me that I NEVER worked at the Ho-HO-Kus Inn.
So I ask to speak to Mrs. Purrizzo and he tells me that haven't I put
her through enough and since she has alstimerzse disease she has no
memory, and that for god's sake go and get some medication as I am a
danger to society and hangs the phone up on me.
I am now very confused, within two hours Dr. Purrizzo's oldest son
(whom I have never met never even knew existed until now) calls me out
of the blue to reassure me that there never was a steroid trial and
that he has a list of psychologist who would be more then glad to help
me. I tell him in a very calm voice that I was just having these
strange memories and I was wondering if his father could help clarify
them for me. Oh yea, I tell him, I'm so sorry to hear about your
mother, HOW LONG HAS SHE HAD ALSTIMERZSE DISEASE? He started to laugh
and then he said "My mother doesn't have alstimerzse
disease!" "Really" I say, well thank you very much and
have a nice day. Within one hour the Ramsey Police have called my
house and spoken to my mother stating that they got a call from Dr.
Purrizzo, and that he recommends that I be sent to a mental institute
immediately and put on heavy medication for the safety of the
community! My Mother reassures the Police that I am no threat to
anyone but I am just having a tough time right now.
This only confirms everything to me that some thing is going on and I
am not crazy. So I call a bluff and call Father Jack at home and leave
on his answering machine something like "I have a copy of the
steroid trial you lying sack of shit and you are on it as clear as
day, I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD LAWYER" and I hang up. The next day
Father Jack calls my house and speaks to my mother. I had told my
mother what I was doing and just for my sake could you
"Please" just play along. Of course when She answers the
phone Father Jack informs her that he has contacted his lawyer and
wants to know what she knows about this "trial" and where is
the tape? What does my mother say?, nothing other then "there
really is no tape. Andy just isn't feeling well, he is just 'off his
rocker'". Father Jack then tells my mother that he doesn't like
being threatened and that if I don't shut up he is going to have the
Police come me lock me away (this is the local priest who interacts
with all the children).
My mother is of course now frantic and I basically locked my self away
in the basement for the next month and didn't say a word to anyone
especially my mother about anymore of this, as she has already
betrayed me once. But think about it? If there never was any steroid
trial, and the whole thing is a figment of my imagination and it all
never happened, then why would a priest (if he is so innocent) contact
his lawyer if there really could be no possibility of there ever being
a tape to begin with. I knew that I was right but the whole world is
against me for some reason and I had to find out what the hell is
going on. So I laid low for a while and tried to piece together the
scrape of memories which I had as there was still no order.
December 25th 1997- For the previous few weeks I have been writing
down my thoughts to try and make some sense of it all. My thinking is
that if I organize some kind of "time line" I can organize
my thoughts and get a better picture. What you are reading is
obviously the time line. Christmas eve I have no friends to talk to
and no where to go. This doesn't bother me in the slightest in terms
of depression because my memories are very slowly starting to fall
together and become clear. Pilar calls me Christmas eve and we talk as
she is in a similar situation. We begin to talk about Aaron and the
strange things that I thought were going on at his apartment. Then
Pilar breaks in and tells me that her and my stories are identical and
she just never brought it up because she thought that she might have
been imagining things or some how going crazy her self. About how
there was lost time at Aaron's. How she remembers starring off into
space and seeing me next to her as Aaron was controlling both of us.
This was a great piece of reassurance and made a lot of other pieces
fall into place as well as a number of other memories come back.
The most important piece to fall into place and the one which had
puzzled me for the longest time was this? I knew as I was leaving
Atlanta that they weren't just going to let me go. They must be
watching me somehow, but I couldn't figure it out, how were they
watching me? AND THEN IT CAME TO ME like a shiver going through my
soul. Here I was safe in the basement of my mothers house where no one
could get to me because I didn't go out at all. After talking to me I
remembered that when I moved back to New Jersey from Atlanta, the
first thing I did was bring back the truck. When I brought it back my
mother's GERMAN friend Astrid was there to pick me up. The first thing
she said to me was "HOW DO YOU FEEL?" and I said "I
feel fine" then she said "AND THE CRAZIES IN YOUR
HEAD?" and I said "What crazies in my head?" Then she
said "That's good". Then she said "ANDY, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THE BOOK MEIN KOMPF?" "Hitler's book?" I
say, I don't know I never read it! She said that's very good.
Hitler's Book "Mien Kempf" is one of the key words they use
to control me. Astrid is the controller who is in turn controlling my
mother to inform them of everything that I do. It all started rushing
back to me. My mother complaining of her trip to Germany to visit
Astrid, and how she seemed to be missing a few days and could not
remember them. My grandmother (on my mothers side) freaking out saying
that she had walked in and Astrid was controlling her in some way and
my mothers response was "don't be ridiculous, Astrid is my best
friend!" I then remembered from way back when I was a child
(maybe 10 years I started freaking out calling Astrid a NAZI at one of
my parents dinner parties and of course my mother apologized
profusely. But I would not give up and I kept screaming "YOU MAY
HAVE THEM FOOLED BUT YOU HAVEN'T FOOLED ME. YOUR A NAZI, YOU NAZI, YOU
NAZI!" and I remember her just sitting there and smiling at me
and I could tell that she was saying to her self "you are one
smart little shit". She had also manipulated my father and has
had a sexual relationship with him over the years (I don't know the
specific details to this at all). These are all the basic control
tactics that THEY use.
At this point I remember going to Astrid's once before when I regained
my memory. I think it was between 1992 and 1994 but I really cannot be
sure). I followed my mother over to Astrid's and watched as the main
hypnotists as well as Mr. Green, and the man with the white hair being
there and manipulating my mother. As I tried to get a closer look they
had a man patrolling outside and I was seen and they chased me down,
caught me and said the "Magic word" and my memory was erased
again. The key point here is that now I know how they are watching me,
and I know who my new controller is. It is my own mother as they are
manipulating her to keep tabs on me. I thought back to what she knows
and to what I have told her in regards to anything I am doing with my
government mind control experiment memories. She knows nothing of any
relevance as I have not said a word to her since the Dr. Purrizzo and
Father Jack incidents as well as the arguments we had back in October
as to what happened in my childhood and since she would just say
"that never happened" to no matter what I said. I just
completely stopped talking to her about it. I have, without even
knowing it, been specifically giving her disinformation and have been
misleading her for months (this is a VERY lucky break). Now that I
know this, I am going to use it to my advantage. And as a matter of
fact now all the comments she would make as to what I was doing, how
she was very concerned as to what I am doing, everything now makes
more sense. But still I can only remember a fraction of what happened
and I am still trying to put it all together. But I have secluded
myself from everyone and now I know what to watch out for, My mother
and Astrid.
January 17th 1998- Using the internet I order some books dealing with
government mind control experiments and covert operations (as I still
am thinking that this is a government experiment because I keep on
remembering being on Navy ships for the assassinations and I keep
seeing Mr. Green during the torture experiments and the conditioning.
At this point I still have no recollection about the Illuminati or ANY
idea about what the big picture really is). One of the books I ordered
was "The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind
Control" by John Marks. In the book he discusses the MKULTRA
programs and how LSD was discovered, then how the CIA Back in the
forties began experiments to find a "truth serum" to make
spy's talk. One of the first projects was with two Navy men and a man
called "Weint" (my father now has the book and I am not sure
of the spelling of his name), but he was the head of the Psychology
department at the University of Rochester. And he conducted his
experiments on the students at Rochester in his secret laboratory in
the attic of the library at the University of Rochester. When I read I
literally fell off the couch as a flood of memories suddenly came
rushing back to me. THE SMALL LAB I MENTION EARLIER IS THE SECRET LAB
IN THE ATTIC OF THE LIBRARY! (and I have enclosed diagrams). I
remember this because when they brought me up there the man with the
white hair said to me "Rhino, what do you think of this place?
This is all for you!" and I said "It's a f*cking dump"
and he said "Well you have to give us some time to fix it up, it
hasn't been used in forty years." Then I remember the beatings
and the electric shock they did to me. I remember trying to escape and
once when I got lose and had kicked the crap out of all the lab guys I
tried to jump out of the only window. I opened the window and was half
way out when I realized that I was at the top of the library and it
was at least a hundred and fifty foot drop down to anything. At that
point I knew I was screwed and I also knew where I was from the view.
I specifically remember that! Then I remember going back with the FBI
once to raid the lab and we broke in and was in the process of seizing
everything when someone very high up in the FBI who was under the
control of the Illuminati OR the NSA or which ever other government
agency they used to control the situation (which I didn't put together
until later), ordered the complete halt of the raid and the whole
thing was covered up. And once again they erased my memory.
January 22ND 1998- I am still writing and trying to piece all this
together. My mother is a woman who is a "Pack rat" if you
will. She collects and saves EVERYTHING especially pertaining to her
son. As I am writing down my thoughts to make sense of it all I go up
stairs and go to the filling cabinet to where my mother keeps
everything. My folder is gone. Everything that pertained to my past,
my high school football clippings, my old report cards, the police
reports of when I got in trouble when I was a kid. These were the
reports I used to shove in my mothers face when we were having an
argument two months before when she was insisting that I was never a
bad kid. It had all mysteriously disappeared. My mother must have told
Astrid when she "reports" to her weekly as to what I am
doing and Astrid must have told her to get rid of the file, to get rid
of anything that would "spark" any more memories. So now my
house has been erased of any memories of my past. I have not said a
word to my mother that I know that my folder is missing, but let me
tell you I was a serious shock to me as everything becomes reality.
But it only adds to the proof of my past. Still no memories of the
Illuminati or any other intervention with the FBI at this point.
