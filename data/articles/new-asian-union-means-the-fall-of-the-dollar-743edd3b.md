One of the most frustrating issues to haunt the
halls of alternative economic analysis is the threat of misrepresentative
terminology.
For instance, when the U.S. government decided
to back
the private Federal Reserve in lowering the interest rates on
lending windows to European banks last month, they did not call this a
bailout, even though thats exactly what it was.
They did not call it quantitative easing, or
fiat printing, or a hyperinflationary landmine; rarely does bureaucracy ever
apply honest terminology to their subversive activities. False terminology
is the bane of every honest analyst, because in order for them to educate
and awaken those who are unaware of the truth, they must first battle
through the daunting muck of the general publics horrifically improper
perceptions and vocabulary.
The chain of financial events taking place over the past decade in Asia has
been correspondingly mislabeled and misunderstood.
What some economists see as total collapse is
actually a new and decidedly prophetic (or engineered) transition.
What some
naively see as the natural progression of globalism, is actually a
distinctly deliberate program of centralization meant to further the goals
of world economic and political totalitarianism.
Asia, and most especially
China, is a Petri dish for elitist psychopaths.
What we see as suffocating collectivism in this
region of the world today is the exact social schematic intended for the
West tomorrow. Call it whatever you will, but on the other side of the
Pacific, like the eerie smile of a sinister clown, sits fabricated fate.
The genius of
globalization is not in how it works, but in how it DOESNT
work. Globalization chains together mismatched cultures through circumstance
and throws us into the deep end of the pool. If one sinks, we all sink,
enslaving us with interdependency.
The question one must ask, then, is whether
sovereign economies are currently tied together in the same way? The answer
is no, not anymore.
Certain countries have moved to insulate
themselves from the domino effect of debt implosion; one of the primary
examples being China.
Since at least 2005, China has been taking the exact steps required to
counter the brunt of a global debt collapse; not enough to make it
untouchable, but enough that its infrastructure will survive. One could even
surmise that Chinas actions indicate a foreknowledge of the events that
would eventually
escalate in 2008.
How they knew is hard to say, but if the
available evidence causes you to lean towards collapse as a Hegelian
creation (and it should if you are paying any attention), then Chinas
activity begins to make perfect sense.
If a globalist insider told you that in a few
short years the two most powerful financial empires in the world were going
to topple like bowling pins under the weight of their own liabilities, what
would you do? Probably separate yourself as much as possible from the
diseased dynamic and construct your own replacement system.
This is what China has done
.
China started with the circulation of Yuan-denominated bonds, like T-Bonds,
meant to securitize Chinese debt, creating an outlet for the currency to go
global. Chinas considerable forex and bond reserves make this move a rather
suspicious one.
With so much savings at their disposal, why
bother to issue bonds at all? Why threaten the traditional export-based
economy and the uneven trade advantage that the country had been thriving on
for decades? The success of Chinese bonds would mean the
internationalization of the Yuan, a floating valuation of the currency, and
the loss of the desirable trade deficit with the United States.
Back in 2005, this all would surely seem like a
novelty that was going nowhere fast. Of course, today Chinas actions
suggest an unprecedented push to convert to a consumer hub at the center of
a massive trading bloc.
To put it simply:
China knew ahead of schedule
that the U.S. was no longer going to be a viable customer, and reliance on
such a country would spell disaster. They have been preparing to break away
from Americas consumer markets and the dollar for some time.
In 2008, after China announced the use of the Yuan in cross-border trade on
a limited basis, I began to write about the possibility that China was
preparing to break from the Greenback.
For the past few years my primary
focus in terms of finance has been the East as a kind of warning bell for
the state of the global economy.
In 2009 and 2010, it became absolutely clear
that China (with the help of global corporate entities) was developing the
skeleton of a new system; a trade network that that had the capacity to
supplant the U.S. and end the dollars world reserve status.
Since then, Yuan bonds have spread across the planet, China has dropped the
dollar in bilateral trade with Russia, the ASEAN trading bloc has formed
into a tight shell of export partners, and that is just the beginning.
Two major announcements in 2011 have solidified
my belief that a complete dump of the dollar by Eastern interests is near
First was the announcement that China was actively and openly pursuing the
establishment of a central bank for the whole of ASEAN, with the Yuan
utilized as the reserve currency instead of the dollar:
China eyes creation of ASEAN Bank.
This news, of course, has barely been reported on in the mainstream. As I
discussed at the beginning of this article, the terminology surrounding
economic developments has been diluted and twisted.
When China states that an ASEAN central bank is
in the works, we need to point out what this really means; the ASEAN trading
bloc is about to become the Asian Union. The only missing piece of the
puzzle is something that I have been warning about for at least a couple
years, ever since my days at Neithercorp (see Migration Of The Black Swans
as a recent example).
This key catalyst is the inclusion of Japan in
ASEAN, something which many said would take five to ten years to unfold.
News released this Christmas speaks otherwise:
China, Japan to Back Direct Trade of Currencies.
Japan has indeed entered into an agreement to drop the dollar in currency
exchange with China and has expressed interest in melting into ASEAN. Japan
has also struck somewhat similar though slightly more limited deals with
India, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines almost simultaneously:
Japan, India Seal $15 Billion Currency Swap
Arrangement to Shore Up Rupee.
This means that the two largest foreign holders of U.S. debt and Greenbacks
will soon be in a position to tap into an export market far more profitable
than that of America, and that all of this trade will be facilitated by
currencies OTHER THAN THE DOLLAR.
It means the end of the dollar as the world
reserve, and probably the end of the dollar as we know it.
Japans inclusion in this process was inevitable. With its economy already
in steep deflationary decline, the Yen skyrocketing in value against the
dollar making exports difficult, as well as the ongoing nuclear meltdown
problem at Fukushima, the island nation has been on the edge of complete
collapse. Its only option, therefore, is to sink into the chaotic seas, or
float like a buoy tied to an Asian Union.
There can be absolutely no doubt now that Japan
will soon implement the latter solution.
The dilemma at this point becomes one of timing.
Now that we are certain
that two of the largest economies in the world are about the dump the
Greenback, what signals can we watch when preparing for the event?
My belief is that the trigger will come squarely
from the U.S. and the Federal Reserve,
-
either as legislation to heavily tax
Asian imports, a renewed threat of further credit downgrades like that which
S&P brought down in
-
or the announcement of more open quantitative
easing
Any and all of these issues could very well arise in the course of
the next 6-12 months, QE3 being a basic no-brainer.
ASEAN could, certainly, drop the dollar
immediately after their central bank apparatus is put in place, resulting in
a much more volatile trade war atmosphere (also useful for full global
centralization later down the road). The point is, we are truly at a place
in our economic life when ANYTHING is possible.
My hope is that as our predictions in the alternative economic community are
proven correct with every passing quarter, more Americans will take note,
and prepare. I can say quite confidently that we have entered the first
stages of the catastrophic phase of the economic implosion.
All the fantastic and terrible consequences many
once considered theory or science fiction, are about to become reality.
Practical solutions have been offered by myself and many others. The only
thing left now is to take action, or ride the tidal wave of destruction like
so much driftwood. We can help to determine the outcome, or we can be idle
spectators.
In everything, there is a choice
.
