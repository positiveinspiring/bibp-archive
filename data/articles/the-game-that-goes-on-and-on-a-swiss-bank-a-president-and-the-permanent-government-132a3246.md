# The Game That Goes On and On - A Swiss Bank, A President and The 
Permanent Government

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_obama94.htm

Last August, the presidential press corps
followed
Barack Obama and his family to Martha's Vineyard for their brief
vacation.
The coverage focused on summery fare - a visit to an ice cream
parlor, the books the president had brought along. Nearly everyone mentioned
his few rounds of golf, including his swing, and the enthusiasm of
onlookers.
What caught my eye, though, was the makeup of his foursome.
The
president was joined by,
-
an old friend from Chicago
-
a young aide
-
Robert
Wolf, Chairman and CEO, UBS Group Americas
In a decidedly incurious piece,
a New York Times reporter made light of Wolf's presence:
"The president has told friends that to truly relax he prefers golfing with
young aides...But he departed from that pattern Monday when he invited a top
campaign contributor, Robert Wolf, president of UBS Investment Bank, to join
him for 18 holes. Call it donor maintenance."
Wolf, however, is hardly - as the Times suggested - just another
donor.
For one thing, he is a leading figure in an industry that almost
brought down the entire financial system - and then was the recipient of
astonishing government largesse. UBS, along with other banks, benefited
directly from the backdoor bailout of the insurance giant AIG.
But UBS stands alone in one rather formidable respect - it was the defendant
in the largest offshore tax evasion case in U.S. history, accused of helping
wealthy Americans hide their income in secret offshore accounts. To settle a
massive investigation, UBS forked over $780 million to the US treasury. This
settlement came shortly before Wolf rounded out Obamas golfing party.
Given
this rather problematical situation, why then would the President choose
UBSs Wolf of all people for this honor?
Wolf declined a request for an interview about his relationship with the
President, so it was not possible to pose that question to him. This hardly
matters, though, for the story goes far beyond Wolf and UBS. It involves
Republicans as well as Democrats, the Bush Administration as well as
Obamas. More importantly, behind the trivialized golf outing on Marthas
Vineyard, lie the interests that increasingly set the course for every
administration.
And that now game the system so well that the rest of us -
wherever we live in the world - are kept fighting for the scraps.

BOTH SIDES NOW
When most people criticize those aspects of government that seem most
impervious to the democratic process, they cite the permanency and perceived
self-interest of the mandarins of the Washington bureaucracy.
But when it
comes to real power, an ability to come out ahead no matter which party is
in power, its hard to top certain financial institutions.
UBS is very much a part of that permanent government. Though not a household
name in the United States, UBS is a major player in the Beltway game.
During
the 2008 campaign, while Robert Wolf was courting Democratic hopeful Obama,
his UBS cohort, former Senator Phil Gramm, was working the other side of the
street. As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee in the 1990s, Gramm, a
corporate-friendly Texas Republican, played a key role in the deregulation
of the banking industry, an act so central to the nations financial
collapse.
Since 2002, Gramm has been UBS Americas vice chairman. In 2008,
he was the leading economics adviser for Obamas opponent, John McCain - and
even touted as a possible treasury secretary in a McCain administration.
The bottom line: UBS hedged its bets, and so had an inside track no matter
which party took the White House. Thus, when Obama won, it was Wolf who
ascended. The new president named the banker-donor to his White House
Economic Advisory Board.
The important machinations behind this accrual of influence rarely get
attention in the frenzied hustle of the news cycle. One reason is that they
do not seem like news at all, since they are essentially woven deeply into
the fabric of politics and government, thus hidden in plain sight. Another
is that they are dauntingly complex.
Some things are simple, though. Like the fact that a UBS executive is a
dubious candidate to serve as an economic advisor to the president. For one
thing, the companys track record at the time of the election was distinctly
underwhelming. UBS suffered major losses on subprime lending, and had to
raise money from the Singapore government and other entities.
As Slates
money columnist Daniel Gross quipped back in 2008,
UBS used to stand for
Union Bank of Switzerland. But perhaps it should stand for Untold Billions
Squandered. Or Underwater Bi-Lingual Schleppers.
Furthermore, UBS stock
lost nearly 70 percent of its value even before the recession really kicked
in - making it the worst performing foreign bank operating here.
Given this damning set of facts, Wolf made both an odd choice as a
presidential adviser and a peculiar pick for that intimate round of golf.
HIDE FUNDS HERE
Despite being the worlds biggest manager of private assets, UBS has stayed
pretty much below the domestic radar.
The Alpine quiet surrounding its
activities was, however, quietly shattered in mid-2007, when an IRS audit of
a US citizen led to a UBS banker who then revealed certain UBS practices
that encouraged wealthy Americans to hide taxable income. UBS bankers had
apparently used every trick in the book - including giving customers code
names and assisting them with or providing them with untraceable pay phones,
encrypted computers, fake trusts, document-shredding and even
counter-surveillance training.
The feds did not move quickly on the revelations - but when they did, in
good measure thanks to a kick from July 2008 Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations hearings chaired by Senator Carl Levin and the report
released in conjunction with the hearings, the UBS affair grew into the
largest offshore tax evasion case in US history.
It is worth pointing out that one of three Senate co-sponsors of the Stop
Tax Haven Abuse Act of 2007, introduced even before the UBS situation was
known, was none other than a then-senator named
Barack Obama.
The House
sponsor was Rahm Emanuel - who would go on to be President Obamas Chief of
Staff.
Another, weaker bill was proffered by Sen. Max Baucus of the Finance
Committee - parts of which did just quietly become law as part of an
employment
stimulus bill signed by Obama in March, 2010, with the goal of
capturing lost tax income as a way of financing job creation.
In any case, it has become increasingly clear that tax evasion is but a
piece of a troubling larger picture.
The states of New York, Texas and
Massachusetts sued the bank in 2008, accusing it of misleading investors
about risks in its auction-rate securities market. UBS executives dumped
their own holdings when the supposedly safe investments took a nosedive, yet
continued to recommend them to customers.
In Puerto Rico, a
Bloomberg News
reporter found, UBS had created its own closed-loop system for generating
profits - it advised the Commonwealth to issue bonds, marketed the
bonds to investors through UBS mutual funds, and then loaned the mutual
funds money so they could buy the bonds.
As James Cox, a Duke law professor
and expert on finance and law said at the time,
Ive never seen such a
blatant series of conflicts of interest.
In a filing last June,
New Hampshire's securities regulator charged UBS with
"dishonest and unethical" practices in selling notes from the now-defunct
Lehman Brothers, causing New Hampshire investors $2.5 million in losses.
Wrote one securities lawyer on Forbes website:
UBS is going to have to
account for why it continued to aggressively market Lehman notes to retail
customers as highly conservative investments at the very same time its
institutional side was facilitating transactions designed to mask Lehman's
financial troubles.
Further south, Brazilian police arrested officials of both UBS and the
insurance giant AIG as part of a half-billion-dollar tax avoidance scheme,
alleging that the companies used suspected black market money-changers to
spirit the funds out of Brazil to Switzerland.
At the time, the daily
newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo published a picture of a man in handcuffs,
identified as a UBS executive, and reported that he told one of the
arresting officers:
"I'm not going to stay in custody. Anyone who has money
in [Brazil] does not stay in custody."
Things are not necessarily so
different up north.
The only company official sent to jail in the United
States thus far in connection with the massive tax evasion case was,
remarkably, the former employee who blew the whistle on the scheme in the
first place.
AN ATTRACTIVE FELLOW
The Obama-UBS relationship began on a December day in 2006.
According to his
calendar, the presidential hopeful was visiting New York City to speak at a
fundraising dinner for children in poverty. Beforehand, though, he attended
a much more exclusive gathering - in the midtown Manhattan conference room
of billionaire George Soros - for a dozen wealthy figures eager to have a
closer look at the prospect.
One attendee was UBS executive Robert Wolf.
Then just 45, he had already
been a major fundraiser for John Kerrys 2004 presidential bid and for
congressional Democrats in 2006. For 2008, he had initially backed a
moderate, Mark Warner, the former governor of Virginia. But when Warner
decided not to run, Wolf turned to Obama, liked what he saw, and signed on.
His motivation, Wolf told New York Magazine in 2007, was simple:
Id like
my children to soon see a president give a State of the Union address and
have both parties applaud.
He praised Obamas early opposition to the
invasion of Iraq.
And he told Business Week:
I found him to be unbelievably
refreshing and smart and thoughtful.
Wolf soon became a top fundraiser.
By
the time of the New York article, he had already hosted two big cocktail
parties, made a lot of calls, and brought in more than $500,000. It was
through people like Wolf that Obama was able to match and then pass Hillary
Clinton in fundraising for the primaries.
Another person who attended that exclusive session with Obama was a
financier by the name of Hassan Nemazee.
Nemazees story circles back to
UBS, through his involvement with Harken Energy, an obscure but supremely
well-connected company that UBS took an unusual interest in keeping afloat.
In the process, it illustrates how byzantine and pervasive the new
trans-partisan money world has become. The complexity helps explain why
reporters so often shrug and move on.
They should pause more often; within
that complexity resides an important truth about American democracy.
THE CLINTONS HOT
MONEY MAN
Over the years, Hassan Nemazee had become, like Wolf, a major Democratic
fundraiser and insider.
More importantly, he was deep into the Clinton inner
circle. So much so, that he and a partner used an investment firm they had
recently acquired, Carret Asset Management, to provide a lucrative perch to
Terry McAuliffe, the Clintons confidante and money man.
(This was in the
period between McAuliffes chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee
and his chairmanship of
Hillary Clintons presidential campaign.)

May, 2008
This indebted
the Clintons further to Nemazee,
who had been an avid supporter of Bill Clintons presidency and major donor
to his defense fund during the Monica Lewinsky/impeachment saga.
Nemazee for
his part was rewarded with appointment as ambassador to Argentina - an offer
that was withdrawn, however, when Forbes reported that he had improperly
represented himself as a Latino in order to secure targeted bond business
from the state of California.
As with UBSs Wolf, Nemazees substantial fundraising soon begot true
insider status. The campaign even asked Nemazee to publicly defend Ms.
Clinton when another top donor, Norman Hsu, was arrested as an alleged
swindler and campaign finance fraudster (Hsu was later convicted.)
Nemazee was frequently characterized as a top foreign policy adviser to
Ms. Clinton. Probably his closest thing to real foreign policy credentials
was the fact that his father was one of the richest men in Iran under the
dictatorship of the Shah Reza Pahlavi, and a close ally of the deposed
leader.
At the time of the meeting to size up Obama in Soross office, Nemazee was simply window-shopping, as he remained committed to Hillary. But
when Hillary dropped out of the race, Nemazee became a major Obama
fundraiser.
And once Hillary became Obamas secretary of state, according to
insiders, she pushed the administration to take a tougher line with Irans
revolutionary Islamic government than Obama preferred. In so doing she
renewed the appreciation of the retinue around the exiled Pahlavi faction,
which still hopes to return to power one day, directly or indirectly.
Notwithstanding Nemazees largesse, both Clinton and Obama must have had
second thoughts this past September, when the financier was arrested on
charges of bank fraud.
Since then, Nemazee has pled guilty to defrauding
several banks over the course of a decade, through the use of false
collateral documentation, to the tune of $292 million. In a brief flurry of
coverage, Nemazees downfall was smirkily dismissed as just another day in
the hothouse of Democratic corruption. The media has shown little further
interest in Nemazee, and in what his arc signified.
This is unfortunate as it was not just a story about Democrats - or
Republicans either, although they were involved. Rather it was the edge of
an amoral iceberg that is essentially trans-partisan and that constantly
exerts influence on presidents and would-be presidents of all stripes.
The outline of that larger reality becomes apparent when one traces
Nemazees path back more than two decades. In that earlier epoch, we find
Nemazee mixed up again with Soros and UBS and a would-be president.
At that
point the rising star was not Barack Obama, but
George W. Bush.
GROWING A BUSH
For many years, Hassan Nemazee has been a business partner of, and shared
offices with, a man named Alan Quasha.
And both of them have been involved
with a company called Harken Energy, a mysterious outfit with links to some
of the worlds most powerful and odiferous regimes.

before

November,
2005.
Harken, Nemazee, Quasha (and UBS) first came to my attention while I was
researching my 2009 book, Family of Secrets, which is an investigative
history of the rise of the Bush family and the special interests behind
them.
I was examining
George W. Bushs run of good fortune in the 1980s when
his failed oil ventures repeatedly became golden as larger ventures scooped
them up and increased his remuneration.
Texas-based Harken Energy, the
biggest of these, paid Bush more than he had ever earned, gave him a nice
board position, and basically freed him up to move to Washington and work on
his fathers 1988 White House race.
Just as Nemazee and Quasha would later take care of Hillary Clintons guy -
McAuliffe - so he could concentrate on preparing for her campaign, years
earlier they had supported George W. Bush while he helped develop strategy
for his fathers campaign.
In the process Harken took Bush, a man without
much to show for himself as a businessman, and gave him the credibility and
financial means with which to embark upon a political career - which he did
soon thereafter.
Why had Harken adopted Bush?
The few media organizations - Time and The Wall
Street Journal among them - that looked into Harken concluded that
something was fishy about the venture itself. The companys structure and
transactions were unnecessarily convoluted. It violated most of the rules of
sound business practice yet somehow continued to exist despite the fact that
it rarely made money for its public shareholders.
It was nigh impossible to figure out where the funding for Harken
originated, beyond shell companies in offshore tax havens such as the
Netherlands Antilles. But what it actually did was nothing short of
astonishing. In 1986, the year George W. Bush entered the picture, Harken
had total revenue of four million dollars.
Three years later, thanks to a
flurry of acquisitions and infinitely complicated transactions, revenue
would exceed a billion dollars.
Notwithstanding its general precariousness and obscurity, Harken somehow
managed to assemble backing from global superstars, ranging from the
billionaire investor
Soros (at one point the largest Harken shareholder),
and Harvard Universitys endowment, to interests tied to the Saudi elite, to
then-Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and to the deposed Shah of Iran.
In other words, this obscure company somehow was catnip to brutal and
corrupt foreign leaders who had grown fabulously wealthy at the expense of
their people - and who collaborated closely with the highest levels of the
US military-intelligence-corporate establishment. (Soross role seems
especially strange; he went on to become the leading single funder of
efforts to deny President George W. Bush a second term.)
UBS was among the
banks that profited from this dubious funding.
UBS had taken a position in Harken at a moment when the company was on the
shoals. Coincidentally or not, this also was when George W. Bush - son of
vice president George H.W. Bush - was part of the corporate board. UBSs
role struck the Wall Street Journal as odd, in part because UBS was not
known for investing in small American firms like Harken.
Facing regulatory difficulties over its investment in Harken, UBS ended up
unloading its stock to Abdullah Taha Bakhsh, a Saudi tycoon with separate
business ties to James Bath, a key Bush family operative who fronted for
Saudi interests in Houston. Bakhsh was also a business partner with a Saudi
royal family favorite labeled by the Federal Reserve as a front man for
BCCI, or Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
For those who have
forgotten, BCCI was a criminal banking operation whose customers ranged from
Western intelligence agencies to drug cartels and terrorist organizations.
Shortly before UBS helped bail out Harken, it had partnered with BCCI in a
Geneva-based bank.
BCCI was eventually shut down in raids commenced by the
British government, after intense investigations by Senator John Kerrys
Foreign Relations terrorism subcommittee and the Manhattan DA. But evidence
of its ties to the highest levels of the US government under Ronald Reagan
and George H.W. Bush, extensively uncovered by investigators, was repeatedly
rebuffed by superiors and by regulators.
It is worth noting that the
Treasury Department official responsible for scrutinizing BCCIs affairs in
the Reagan-Bush administration was assistant secretary for enforcement John
M. Walker Jr. - who happened to be the cousin of George H.W. Bush.
(Bushes
have for generations been involved both in government and banking, with
another close relative serving as a top official at Lehman Brothers before
it precipitously failed. More on this topic, and on George H.W. Bushs
secret past in deep covert intelligence work, can be found in my book,
Family of Secrets. )
Keep in mind that such is the business milieu of Nemazee and Quasha, who
jumped with apparently little effort from the Bush to Clinton camps when the
moment was opportune - and one of whom ended up a player in the Obama
campaign.
Scenarios like this cause the mind to reel.
Yet where Ferdinand Marcos, the
Saudi royal family, and the Shah converge with the son of an American
president, in a deal involving large amounts of money, it is not necessary
to untangle all the spaghetti strands to sense that something is amiss.
Why,
to begin with, would a major international bank get involved with a shadowy
operation such as Harken? Whatever the reasons, the bank clearly gained
influence with a White House that had family connections to the company.
Clues may be found in 1986, which is when George W. Bush joined the Harken
board. It also is the year that Harkens chairman, Alan Quasha, hooked up
with something called Rembrandt Group Holdings, a Swiss-based company headed
by a South African billionaire, Anton Rupert.
Rembrandts vast portfolio included tobacco,
financial services, wines and spirits, gold and diamond mining and luxury
goods. Soon after that, Rembrandt took over a small, closely-held Denver
company, Frontier Oil. Frontier then announced an $ 85-million "revolving
credit facility" with
Union Bank of Switzerland.
UBS again.
Few expect international bankers to be paragons of virtue, but the South
African connection highlights a particularly unsavory side. This was
revealed in a series of reports produced by a coalition of Swiss
organizations pushing for reparations to post-apartheid South Africa and
cancellation of that countrys debt to Switzerland.
The group took
particular interest in two South African-controlled companies that were
established in Switzerland at the time of global economic sanctions against
the apartheid regime - and one of these was Rembrandt.
According to one of the reports from Koordination Südliches Afrika, Swiss
banks had played an important role,
in financing the apartheid state and its
corporations from the very beginning and that
the two Swiss banks UBS
and CS Group have played a special role.
UBSs former chairman, Nikolaus Senn, actually had a medal bestowed on him
for service to the white regime.
When it became inevitable that apartheid
would crumble, Senn nevertheless pronounced his doubts about giving blacks
the franchise:
One manone vote to me is not a world religion.
The connections here are worth considering.
In 1988, while George W. Bush
advised his fathers presidential campaign and sat on Harkens board, Harken
chairman Alan Quasha joined the board of Richemont, a new Swiss-based
company controlled by the same South African Rupert family that controlled
Rembrandt. UBSs Senn became Richemonts chairman.
So George W. Bush was joining an obscure company whose constituent parts
were tied to the white power structure in South Africa, and also to the
evasion of sanctions against that regime via Switzerland.
And UBS played a
central role in the arrangement.
The South African regime was not the only one that got in on this money
game. Ferdinand Marcos, the late dictator of the Philippines, whose kleptocratic rule was marked by savage human rights abuses and martial law,
had a seat at the table too. The father of Alan Quasha, Harkens chairman,
was an American lawyer who lived most of his adult life in the Philippines,
and represented clients tied to US intelligence.
He remained an advocate of
Marcos to the end.

Former Philippines strongman Ferdinand Marcos,
having secreted a vast
fortune in foreign bank accounts before
fleeing into exile
in 1986, arrives at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu.
Marcos also was moving billions pillaged from the Philippine and American
people (via aid to that country) into Swiss accounts.
In fact, Phil
Kendrick, who sold Harken Energy to Alan Quasha, recalls having heard rumors
back then that the money to buy him out came from Marcos himself. The Bushes
and Marcos were famously friendly.
As vice president, George HW Bush visited
Marcoss Philippines during its protracted martial law and declared that
country, to considerable subsequent ridicule, a great and vibrant example.
We love you, sir, we love your adherence to
democratic principles, vice president Bush
said on that 1981 trip.
And Marcoss widow Imelda would speak,
elliptically, of how the elder Bush had given her husband advice on how to
invest his fortune. Bush and Marcos even took lessons from the same golf
instructor.

Back in the 1950s, George W. Bushs grandfather, Senator Prescott Bush,
a powerful former banker, was
President Eisenhowers regular golf partner.
Its all about access - and golf has long played
a crucial role.
Back in the 1950s, Senator Prescott Bush, father of HW and a
powerful former banker himself, used to have unique access to President
Eisenhower as his regular golf partner.
By the time of Barack Obamas
little-studied invitation to Robert Wolf to round out his foursome, Wolf
(and UBS), too, were already on the inside.
Early in the Obama
administration, Wolf had quietly been appointed to Obamas Economic Advisory
Board. The fact that UBS is now playing a role in the administration of a
liberal democratic reformer illustrates just how trans-partisan money
interests can be.
Though the board has engendered little media notice
besides an Associated Press piece that subtly tried to spark broader
curiosity, its makeup alone deserves attention - for what it tells us about
the group that had the ear of the President as he embarked upon his change
agenda.

his old friend and fellow member
of the Yale secret society, Skull and Bones.

Feb,
2003.
One of Wolfs fellow board members is William H. Donaldson, an old friend of
the Bush family who served on the board of the tobacco company Philip Morris
for two decades.
Donaldson headed the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette, which looked after the financial affairs of George W. Bush over
the years. Donaldson was one of the directors brought into Frontier Oil when
it was taken over by the Quasha-Rembrandt-Bush-UBS group. President George
W. Bush named Donaldson head of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), where he served from 2001-2005.
During that period, he presided over
changes requested by investment banks that lessened regulation; among other
things, the SEC chose to rely on the banks own computer models for risk
assessments.
"If anything goes wrong," said Harvey Goldschmid, another
commissioner at the time, "it's going to be an awfully big mess."
And indeed it is.
The staff director for Obamas Economic Advisory Board, who also serves as a
member of the presidents powerful Council of Economic Advisers, is Austan
Goolsbee, who along with Donaldson and Bush shared membership in the
exclusive Yale secret society, Skull and Bones.
Goolsbee has pretty much
stayed out of the news, except for a brief scandal during the 2008 campaign
when a Canadian government internal memo characterized Goolsbee as
reassuring our Northern neighbors that Obamas anti-NAFTA rhetoric was just
that, political positioning that did not reflect the candidates real
position on globalization.

November, 1999.
People wonder why, year after year, promise after promise, so little seems
to change in Washington.
But it is usually left to academics and
theoreticians to explain, somewhat abstractly and historically, how powerful
institutions continue to influence the course of public affairs irrespective
of who is in the White House and what party is in charge. Meanwhile, polls
show that most Americans think that banks got a much better deal out of the
Bush-Obama rescue-stimulus than the average Joe.
And theyre right - but
they dont quite get the real story on how such deals come about.
Supporters of Barack Obama argue that reporting on his connections to the
powerful permanent government can only impede his sincere efforts to
reform health care, the financial industry and so on.
But such revelations
carry an important message: that American presidents, no matter how good
their intentions, are inevitably enmeshed in a self-reinforcing web of
interests and influences that permits the wealthy to shape our national
destiny no matter who controls the government in Washington.
Shining a light
on the UBS-Obama link can serve as yet another warning beacon to anyone who
underestimates the nature of the challenge facing American democracy.
Figuring out how our world works - actually works - requires a
skeptical eye and a willingness to follow the facts wherever they lead.
After all, sometimes a good golf story is just a story about some guys
playing golf. And sometimes it isnt.
