A recent
report in the New York Times
(NYT) claims,
through trusted sources, that Qatar began weapons
shipments to opposition militants in Syria at the
same time they increased support for Al Qaeda
linked militants fighting Colonel Gaddafi in Libya
in 2011. Gaddafi was ousted (murdered) in October
2011; one must assume that any increase in Qatari
efforts to arm the militants in Libya were delivered
long in advance of Gaddafis ouster, meaning the
synonymous shipments to rebels in Syria also
commenced well before October 2011.
This information again sheds further light on a
timeline of events in Syria that have been purposefully obscured within
mainstream media to suit certain actors agendas, and to enable the false and
misleading narrative of Assad killing peaceful protesters to become
dominant in the discourse surrounding the Syrian conflict.
As was revealed earlier this year - known by many for much longer - it
has been Qatar at the forefront of efforts to arm and fund the insurgency in
Syria.
As the resilience of the Assad regime and the
Syrian Army prolonged the Syrian conflict far beyond the timeframe the
backers of the insurgency foresaw; more and more evidence has become
available as to the exact nature of this US-led proxy-war, and the
ideologies of the militants fighting it.
In turn, timelines have constantly been altered,
misinformed and manipulated to suit the desired narratives of actors who
claim to be on the side of freedom and democracy.
In sum, previous to the aforementioned NYT
article, there had been no reports - in mainstream press at least - of any
arms shipments or covert state activity against Syria before early 2012″.
Now that timeline has once again been revised,
to at least the same time of an increase of Qatari covert policy in Libya;
which would have necessarily come before
the fall of Gaddafi in October 2011.
The latest revelation in the NYT seems to be
an intentional leak, designed to pass responsibility for the extremist
dominated insurgency currently destroying Syria, onto Qatars doorstep.
Considering the timing of this report, and
several others in recent mainstream media that have pointed the finger at
Qatar being the main sponsor of the Syrian insurgency, it also begs the
question: was there more to the Qatari Emirs, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa
Al Thani (and his trusted and longtime Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim
Al Thanis) recent departure and handover of power to his son Tamim
than meets the eye? A slap on the wrist from the US for Qatars destructive
foreign policy maybe?
Who knows,
it seems most knowledgeable Middle East analysts really
have no clue as to why the Emir chose to suddenly step down and relinquish
power. If there is one message coming from this unprecedented handover in
the Western press it is this:
what goes on in Qatar, stays in Qatar.
The NYT cites a Western diplomat (anonymous of
course) who states that Qatar:
punch
immensely above their weight... They keep everyone off-balance by not
being in anyones pocket
Their influence comes partly from being
unpredictable.
Again, this seems to be a desired caveat to
remove culpability from Western actors, and is highly likely the same
source that provided the leak on Qatars covert actions.
What is counterintuitive to the theory that
Qatar acts of its own accord in such instance; is the fact that Qatars
military and intelligence apparatus is entirely built and run by the United
States. Qatar and the US have held an intimate relationship on all things
military since the early 90′s.
Qatar is also,
The US enjoys the luxury of the use of three
airbases in the tiny nation of Qatar, one of which (Al Udeid) is the
prime location of Qatari arms flights to Syria.
Considering this close military relationship; it
would be foolish to believe the United States would be unaware of Qatari
covert activity, particularly when one also considers the
broad and global spying and SIGINT powers we now all know the Pentagon,
and US government have at their disposal.
It should also be noted that Doha acts as a
primary base in the region for US diplomacy, as the
Taliban can happily attest to.
Furthermore -
as covered extensively in a previous article - once Gulf covert arms
shipments to Syrian rebels became public knowledge, the Obama
administration made distinct efforts in the media to portray the CIA as the
key coordinator and oversight of the shipments to allay concerns of
weapons ending up in the wrong hands.
The US, through the CIA has been using its
logistic, diplomatic, and military power to bypass international laws and
help to organize a multi-national covert arms supply chain to rebels in
Syria.
Furthermore, in
a recent interview for The National Interest given by renowned former US
National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski - a declared advocate of the US policy of
arming Osama Bin-Laden and fellow ideologues in the Afghan-Soviet war of the
80′s - went as far as to openly admit the joint US-Saudi-Qatari policy of
orchestrating the Syrian crisis, but refrained from revealing an explicit
timeline:
In late 2011 there are outbreaks in Syria
produced by a drought and
abetted by two well-known autocracies in the Middle East: Qatar and
Saudi Arabia.
He [Obama] all of a sudden announces that
Assad has to go - without, apparently, any real preparation for making
that happen.
Then in the spring of 2012, the election
year here, the CIA under General Petraeus, according to The New York
Times of March 24th of this year, a very revealing
article, mounts a large-scale effort to assist the Qataris and the
Saudis and link them somehow with the Turks in that effort.
Was this a strategic position?
Yet contrary to this long-revealed policy, the
NYT claims:
The
United States has little leverage over Qatar on the Syria issue because
it needs the Qataris help on other fronts.
For the NYT to claim the US has no control of
arms shipments from a key ally is disingenuous at best, outright propaganda
at worst.
Moreover, the CIA has been in direct
consultation with Qatar on arms shipments, and who exactly those arms
should be sent to, (vetted moderates of course!!) as Qatari officials
stated in this
Reuters article from May this year:
Theres an operations room in the
Emirs diwan (office complex), with representatives from every ministry
sitting in that room, deciding how much money to allocate for Syrias
aid, the Qatari official said.
Theres a lot of consultation with the CIA, and they help
Qatar with buying and moving the weapons into Syria, but just as
consultants.
Are we seriously supposed to believe that Qatar,
a tiny resource-rich nation that is totally dependent on US militarism and
diplomatic protection is acting of its own accord, without any US
assistance, right under the US militarys nose?
The NYT report goes on to state:
Qatars
covert efforts to back the Syrian rebels began at the same time that it
was increasing its support for opposition fighters in Libya trying to
overthrow the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi...
The Obama administration quietly blessed the
shipments to Libya of machine guns, automatic rifles, mortars and
ammunition, but American officials later grew concerned as evidence grew
that Qatar was giving the weapons to Islamic militants there.
The
Obama
administration was fully aware of who
Qatar were arming, and sending
special forces to fight alongside in Libya.
It was exactly the same variety of militants and
extremist ideologues that are currently waging war upon the Syrian State.
Islamic radicals had used Benghazi as a base since the very start of the
Libyan revolution, and the US knew they formed the core of the militia
Qatar were shipping arms to in efforts to oust Gaddafi.
The Obama administrations concern of
MANPADS falling into the wrong hands (a
la Afghanistan) is belied by Obamas tacit approval of his Gulf allies
policy of allowing tonnes of arms, explosives and military materiel to
extremist dominated militia.
A few MANPADS simply increases the likelihood of
blowback upon a civilian target, and the consequent exposure; which is the
Obama administrations major concern. As the NYT report states, one of the
shipments of MANPADS that has entered Syria, came from the very same former
Gaddafi stockpiles of Eastern bloc weapons looted by Qatari backed militants
in Libya.
In summary, the current media leaks on arms
shipments to Syria can be construed as the Obama administration attempting
to build plausible deniability.
The constant revision of the Syrian timeline
also points to the retroactive smoke-screen being applied to
US-led covert policies that have already been exposed. Indeed, this
tactic of using client states to gain deniability of US aggression is
nothing new.
The policy has provided the United States with
the ultimate get-out-clause through decades of subversion and aggression
upon sovereign nations.
If - as is the current trajectory in Syria - the
militants that the United States ad its clients foment, fund and arm, become
an uncontrollable monster and fail to achieve the desired short-term
objectives; the US can simply disassociate and point the finger to one of
its lesser allies, on this occasion, that finger seems to point directly at
the former Emir of Qatar.
One wonders if in twenty years time US
diplomats will portray the same vacant regret for their role in the
creation of Jabhat al Nusra and fellow ideologues; as they do now for
their role in the creation of Al Qaeda itself.
As the United States continues its divisive and
destructive policies to desperately cling to hegemony; the mantra of
lessons have been learned is more hollow than ever.
