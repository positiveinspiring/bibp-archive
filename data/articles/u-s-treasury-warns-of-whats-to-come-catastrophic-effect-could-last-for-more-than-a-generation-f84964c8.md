The next time someone tells you that the US
government is operating in a fiscally sustainable manner and that our
economy is growing strongly point them to the latest report from the U.S.
Treasury Department.
According to the new report released yesterday
all of our worst fears may soon be realized should the United States default
on its obligations to creditors, employees, and recipients of
state-sponsored benefits.
The report details the consequences of Congress
failing to raise the debt ceiling so that the government can borrow more
money. The political impasse will likely be resolved in the 11th hour just
as it has been during prior showdowns.
But, the report has much broader
implications. This is nothing short of an official admission
and confirmation of the decades long woeful mismanagement of U.S. economic,
fiscal and monetary policy.
Heres what you can expect to happen on that
fateful day when our government is no longer extended the credit it needs to
cover its trillion dollar commitments:
"In the event that a debt limit impasse were
to lead to a default, it could have a
catastrophic effect on not just financial markets but also on job
creation, consumer spending and economic growth," the report
said.
"Credit
markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, US interest
rates could skyrocket, the negative spillovers could reverberate around
the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that
could echo the events of 2008 or worse."
"Considering the experience of countries around the world that have
defaulted on their debt, not only might the economic consequences of
default be profound, but those consequences, including high interest
rates, reduced investment, higher debt payments, and slow economic
growth, could last for more than a generation," the report states.

While all the political hoopla in Congress will
eventually lead to an agreement on raising the debt ceiling, the fact is
that we are very quickly approaching our limit as a nation.
At some point our creditors are going to pull
the plug. They understand that the
$200 trillion in obligations we have will
never be met. Countries like Russia, China, and even the private central
banking conglomerates are positioning their chess pieces right now for when
this day comes.
The end result is going to widespread financial
and economy destruction, a meltdown of the U.S. dollar, and a collapse of
our very way of life as tens of millions of Americans will be instantly
impoverished.
Economic analyst John Williams has warned that
when it does finally happen, we can fully expect
disruptions to our food supplies and the normal flow
of commerce.
Without the U.S. dollar as a viable mechanism of
exchange, such a scenario could very quickly lead to civil unrest,
violence, and widespread looting. While most Americans may deny that the
possibility exists, its exactly the scenario that U.S. Homeland Security
experts and the Pentagon
have been simulating for years.
The U.S. Treasury Department has confirmed it
can happen. The military and DHS are
actively war-gaming contingency plans and
stockpiling ammunition, recruiting soldiers
for interment operations, and arming up
local police forces. Furthermore, governments around the world
are training for it.
Take their lead, and do the same on an
individual level by developing
your own long-term preparedness plan. Set
aside
food in case it is no longer available at
grocery stores. Save some
gold and silver to utilize as a mechanism of exchange should the dollar
crash.
Learn to use a firearm and have ammunition on
hand to defend yourself when the
masses start fighting for whatever
resources remain.
While the timing of the Treasury Departments
report is designed to instill fear in the American public, understand that
raising the debt ceiling will do absolutely nothing to resolve the
underlying issues we face and the consequences that will eventually be
realized.
