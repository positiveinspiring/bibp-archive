# Top Ten Conspiracy Theories that Turned FACT in 2017

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/esp_sociopol_nwo249.htm

1 - Hollywood
and the political elite have been exposed for their rampant and
horrifying sex abuse against men, women, and children alike
Just last year, as good people tried to point out that although
Pizzagate
may not have taken place in some restaurant
in D.C., the
idea of sex abuse among the elite was no laughing matter.
However, anyone who
mentioned sex abuse among the elite was scoffed at and ridiculed by
those in the mainstream.
This ridicule was in spite of the fact that the former speaker of
the house admitted to raping multiple little boys and was sentenced
to prison last year.
This ridicule was also in
spite of the fact that whistleblowers have been shouting from the
mountain tops about the rampant abuse - for decades - only to have
their cries fall on deaf ears.
This year, however, it was different.
With
Harvey Weinstein as the
catalyst, former victims came forward and began publicly naming
their abusers and even getting the police involved. The American
people also learned that their ostensible representation in D.C. was
spending millions to silence the victims of their apparent
uncontrollable sex abuse.
No longer will companies
like Disney be able to hire
convicted pedophiles as the world looks the other way - nor will
sicko politicians be allowed the immunity to rape and pillage as
they see fit.
2017 will be known as the
year the victims fought back.
2 - Weather
modification just jumped from "chemtrail" conspiracy theory into
mainstream reality, as Congress began holding hearings on
geoengineering
Geoengineering
is finally going mainstream.
The
U.S. House Subcommittee on Environment and Subcommittee on Energy
Hearing, in November, held the first House hearing about the science
that until now has generally been considered a "conspiracy theory"
and relegated to the fringe's of society by the Praetorian Guard
mainstream media - controlled by the ruling power-elite oligarchy.
The controversial
subject of climate engineering or weather modification - which was
popularized, and oversimplified with the term "chem-trails" - is
stepping from the shadows and into the light of public scrutiny for
the first time.
The congressional
hearing, titled "Geoengineering
-
Innovation, Research, and Technology," was attended by members
of the House committees as well as representatives of think tanks,
academics, and researcher scientists to discuss the future of
geoengineering research.
During the first
hearing, the potential need to set up a regulatory structure within
which experiments would be allowed, at a set scale, was discussed.
Now, those who deny
the fact that government
is involved in geoengineering will be the
conspiracy theorists.
3 - 20,000 documents were
released in August proving the EPA conspired with chemical companies
to unleash deadly toxic substances on the public
Highly toxic
chemical compounds made by Dow,
Monsanto, DuPont and other companies
were being developed and marketed in ever greater quantities, and federal
agencies were rubber-stamping their approval based on fraudulent
safety testing.
The
Poison Papers reveal that, instead of acting to protect the
public and reassess the chemicals, EPA
held a secret meeting with chemical companies to assure them that
their products would continue being sold.
The secret meeting
between EPA and chemical companies is the most poignant example of a
long history of collusion at the expense of human and environmental
health.
4 - US media giant Sally
Quinn admitted she practiced the occult to murder people - and she
was praised for it
Although her
husband Ben Bradlee died in 2014 - who was good friends with former
President John F. Kennedy, and executive editor of the Washington
Post from 1968 to 1991 - Sally Quinn has since taken the time to give
insight into the glamorous life lived by the media's royal couple.
Some of the
practices she describes are ones that would normally be written off
as crazy conspiracy theories by outlets such as their beloved
Washington Post.
However, WaPost
actually
praised it.
In her latest publication titled, "Finding
Magic - A Spiritual Memoir," Quinn
reveals that she believes she has killed at least three people in
her lifetime.
She claims that
while she did not harm anyone physically, she believes strongly in
the occult, and
has used hexes on people who got on her bad side.
Seriously...
5. Mainstream media
finally admitted the United States has been aiding terrorists in
Syria
In November, the
BBC released a bombshell report confirming that the US and Syrian
Defense Forces knowingly aided thousands of ISIS fighters.
According to the bombshell
BBC report:
The BBC has
uncovered details of a secret deal that let hundreds of Islamic
State fighters and their families escape
from Raqqa, under the gaze of the US and British-led coalition
and Kurdish-led forces who control the city.
A convoy
included some of IS's most
notorious members and - despite reassurances - dozens
of foreign fighters. Some of those have
spread out across Syria, even making it as far as Turkey.
Then in December,
an investigation concluded that 97 percent of the weapons used by
the Islamic State were supplied illegally by the U.S. and Saudi
Arabia.
The weapons and
ammunition were originally purchased
by the United States and Saudi Arabia and then distributed
to rebel groups.
While the U.S.
claimed to be fighting ISIS, the fact is that ISIS was one of the
Syrian rebel groups opposing Assad, and as the
report noted,
nearly all of their weapons came from
those purchased by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.
6. The Federal Reserve
bank was exposed in June to be a working arm of US Intelligence
Confidential
accounts within
the Federal Reserve have been used by the U.S.
Treasury and other departments,
"several times a year to analyze
the asset holdings of the central banks of Russia, China, Iraq,
Turkey, Yemen, Libya and others," according to a report from
Reuters that cites more than a dozen current and former senior
U.S. officials.
"The U.S. central bank keeps a
tight lid on information contained in these accounts.
But according to the officials
interviewed by Reuters, U.S. authorities regularly use a need
to know' confidentiality exception in the Fed's service
contracts with foreign central banks."
7. Declassified document
proved the conspiracy that the CIA planned and carried out the 1953
Iranian Coup
The newly
declassified documents, titled
"Foreign Relations of the United States, 1952-1954, Iran, 1951-1954,"
provide a notable difference from the State Department's 1989
version of the coup, which left out any involvement from American
and British intelligence.
A memorandum from
Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles to President Eisenhower, dated March
1, 1953, serves as a reminder that internally,
"the
elimination of Mossadeq by
assassination or otherwise," was used as a method in
repairing ties with Iran, restoring oil negotiations, and
stopping a "Communist
takeover."
8. Billionaire elitists
openly admit to Ingesting the blood of young children
Once the talk of
conspiracy theorists - the rich ingesting the blood of the young to
foster longevity -
is now a reality and
an actual business in the United States.
Not only is it a
business but billionaires are actually admitting their interest in
it.
As Vanity Fair
reports, Ambrosia,
which buys its blood from blood banks, now has about 100 paying
customers. Some are Silicon Valley technologists - like Peter Thiel,
the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and adviser to Donald Trump.
9. CIA drug trafficking
conspiracy was blown wide open in an explosive History Channel
series
A&E Networks
addressed the
government's role in the drug war in a four-part
documentary series on the
History Channel, titled, "America's
War on Drugs."
"America's War on
Drugs" is an immersive trip through the last five decades,
uncovering how
the CIA, obsessed with keeping America
safe in the fight against communism, allied itself with the mafia
and foreign drug traffickers.
In exchange for support against
foreign enemies, the groups were allowed to grow their drug trade in
the United States.
10. Mainstream science
showed Vitamin C's ability to fight cancer
According to researchers
from the University of Iowa, ascorbate, derived from Vitamin C,
was successfully observed increasing hydrogen peroxide levels in
cancer cells, which in turn had a toxic result with cancer cells,
killing the cancer cells in lab rats yet not damaging normal cells
in the process.
The researchers
concluded that Vitamin C might, indeed, be lethal to some cancers.
According to
the scientists,
"These results
indicate that an in vivo measurement
of catalase activity in tumors may predict which cancers will
respond to pharmacological ascorbate therapy."
Once the exact
cancers are identified, which are killed by vitamin C, the
researchers concluded,
"this
information can also be used in finding combination therapies
that may increase the efficacy of treatment for those tumors
with higher catalase activities."
In other words,
extremely high doses of the Vitamin C derivative may potentially be
added to conventional cancer therapies to help kill more cancer
cells.
