Pulling back the curtain on
how
intent the wealthiest Americans have been on
establishing a propaganda tool to
subvert democracy.
Where there is the possibility of democracy, there is the inevitability of
elite insecurity.
All through its history, democracy has been
under a sustained attack by elite interests, political, economic, and
cultural. There is a simple reason for this: democracy - as in true
democracy - places power with people. In such circumstances, the few who
hold power become threatened.
With technological changes in modern history,
with literacy and education, mass communication, organization and activism,
elites have had to react to the changing nature of society - locally and
globally.
From the late 19th century on, the threats to elite interests
from the possibility of true democracy mobilized institutions, ideologies,
and individuals in support of power.
What began was a massive social engineering
project with one objective: control. Through educational institutions, the
social sciences, philanthropic foundations, public relations and advertising
agencies, corporations, banks, and states, powerful interests sought to
reform and protect their power from the potential of popular democracy.
Yet for all the efforts, organization, indoctrination and reformation of
power interests, the threat of democracy has remained a constant, seemingly
embedded in the human consciousness, persistent and pervasive.
In his highly influential work, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind,
French social psychologist Gustav Le Bon suggested that middle class
politics were transforming into popular democracy, where the opinion of the
masses was the most important opinion in society.
He wrote:
The destinies of nations are elaborated at
present in the heart of the masses, and no longer in the councils of
princes.
This was, of course, a deplorable change for
elites, suggesting that,
[t]he divine right of the masses is about
to replace the divine right of kings.
Le Bon suggested, however, that the crowd was
not rational, but rather was driven by emotion and passion.
An associate and friend of Le Bons, Gabriel Tarde, expanded upon
this concept, and articulated the idea that the crowd was a social group
of the past, and that the public was the social group of the future.
The public, argued Tarde, was a,
spiritual collectivity, a dispersion of
individuals who are physically separated and whose cohesion is entirely
mental.
Thus, Tarde identified in the growth of the
printing press and mass communications a powerful medium through which the
public was shaped, and that, if managed appropriately, could bring a sense
of order to a situation increasingly chaotic.
The newspaper, Tarde explained, facilitated,
the fusion of personal opinions into local
opinions, and this into national and world opinion, the grandiose
unification of the public mind.
The development of psychology, psychoanalysis,
and other disciplines increasingly portrayed the public and the population
as irrational beings incapable of making their own decisions.
The premise was simple: if the population was
driven by dangerous, irrational emotions, they needed to be kept out of
power and ruled over by those who were driven by reason and rationality,
naturally, those who were already in power.
The Princeton Radio Project, which began in the 1930s with Rockefeller
Foundation funding, brought together many psychologists, social scientists,
and experts armed with an interest in social control, mass communication,
and propaganda.
The Princeton Radio Project had a profound
influence upon the development of a modern democratic propaganda in the
United States and elsewhere in the industrialized world.
It helped in establishing and nurturing the
ideas, institutions, and individuals who would come to shape Americas
democratic propaganda throughout the Cold War, a program fostered between
the private corporations which own the media, advertising, marketing, and
public relations industries, and the state itself.
A Genuinely
Democratic Propaganda
World War I popularized the term propaganda and gave it negative
connotations, as all major nations involved in the war effort employed new
techniques of modern propaganda to mobilize their populations for war.
In the United States, the effort was led by
President Woodrow Wilson in the establishment of the Committee on Public
Information (CPI) as a vast propaganda ministry.
The central theme of the CPI was to promote U.S.
entry into the war on the basis of seeking to make a world that is safe for
democracy.
This point was specifically developed by the
leading intellectual of the era, Walter Lippmann, who by the age of
25 was referred to by President Theodore Roosevelt as the most brilliant
man of his age.
Lippmann was concerned primarily with the
maintenance of the state-capitalist system in the face of increased unrest,
resistance, and ideological opposition, feeling that the discipline of
science would need to be applied to democracy, where social engineers and
social scientists,
would provide the modern state with a
foundation upon which a new stability might be realized.
For this, Lippmann suggested the necessity of
intelligence and information control in what he termed the manufacture of
consent.
Important intellectuals of the era then became principally concerned with
the issue of propaganda during peacetime, having witnessed its success in
times of war.
Propaganda, wrote Lippmann,
has a legitimate and desirable part to play
in our democratic system.
A leading political scientist of the era,
Harold Lasswell, noted:
Propaganda is surely here to stay.
In his 1925 book, The Phantom Public,
Lippmann wrote that the public was a bewildered herd of ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders who should be maintained as interested spectators of
action, and distinct from the actors themselves, the powerful.
Edward Bernays, the father of public
relations and nephew of Sigmund Freud got his start with Wilsons CPI
during World War I, and had since become a leading voice in the fields of
propaganda and public relations.
In his 1928 book,
Propaganda, Bernays
wrote:
The conscious and intelligent manipulation
of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important
element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen
mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the
true ruling power of our country.
Modern society was dominated by a,
relatively small number of persons
who
understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses, and
this was, in Bernays thinking, a logical result of the way in which
our democratic society is organized.
Bernays referred to this - borrowing from
Walter Lippmann - as the engineering of consent.
For the leading intellectuals and social engineers of the era, propaganda
was presented as distinctly democratic and as a necessity to the proper
functioning of society.
John Marshall of the Rockefeller
Foundation focused on what he called the,
problem of propaganda and sought to
create, as he wrote in 1938, a genuinely democratic propaganda.
Marshall pursued this objective through the
Rockefeller Foundation, and specifically with the Princeton Radio Project in
the late 1930s under the direction of Hadley Cantril and Frank Stanton,
though including other intellectuals such as Paul Lazarsfeld and Harold
Lasswell.
In 1936, Marshall wrote that the best way to expand the use of radio and
film was for the Rockefeller Foundation to give,
a few younger men with talent for these
mediums an opportunity for relatively free experimentation
men
interested primarily in education, literature, criticism, or in
disseminating the findings of the social or natural sciences.
In 1939, with the war in Europe under way, the
Rockefeller Foundation had organized several conferences and published
several papers on the issue of mass communication, directed by what was
called the Communications Group, headed by Marshall and other
Foundation officials, and with the participation of Lasswell, Lazarzfeld,
Cantril, and several others.
Early on, the Communications Group noted
that with,
an increasing degree of [government]
control
in regard to all phases of communication, such as in the
schools, the radio, the films, the press, and even eventually in all
public discussion,
...it was necessary to arrive at a consensus -
among the experts - as to what role they should play as the state
expands its authority over communication.
Sociologist Robert Lynd took a page from
Lippmann and wrote that a goal of experts in communication should,
be that of persuading the people that there
are many issues too complicated for them to decide, which should be left
to 'experts'.
One other participant commented on Lynds
suggestion:
Mr. Lynd feels we need a restructuring of
democratic action in terms of the capacity of different groups of the
population and an abandonment of the American idea of the responsibility
and capacity of the man on the street.
In 1940, John Marshall wrote:
In a period of emergency such as I believe
we now face, the manipulation of public opinion to meet emergency needs
has to be taken for granted.
In such a period, those in control must
shape public opinion to support courses of action which the emergency
necessitates
No one, I think, can blame them for that impulse.
In a 1940 memo for the Communications Group,
Marshall wrote that,
We believe
that for leadership to secure
that consent will require unprecedented knowledge of the public mind and
of the means by which leadership can secure consent
We believe
that we gave available today
methods of research which can reliably inform us about the public mind
and how it is being, or can be, influenced in relation to public
affairs.
The memo concerned some officials at the
Rockefeller Foundation, noting that it could be misinterpreted and that such
research should be careful about becoming a mere tool of the state, with one
official noting:
Public opinion and vested interests are
violently opposed to such a development which would be labeled as
fascist or authoritarian.
Another official suggested that the memo,
looks to me like something that [Nazi
propaganda chief] Herr Goebbels could put out with complete sincerity.
While one Foundation official referred to the
memo as resembling,
the methods by which democracy has been
destroyed, he added that, finding out regularly and completely what
the mass of the people feel and believe and think about things and
policies is a necessary part of the modern democratic process.
Marshall and the Communications Group
refined their approach from a more overt authoritarianism of one-way
communication between the state and the population, to a more
Lippmann-centered concept of manufacturing consent and what has been
referred to as democratic elitism.
In the final report of the Communications Group
in 1940, it was noted that two-way communication between the government and
population was essential, as without it, democracy is endangered, and that
it was required for the population to give consent.
Frank Stanton, along with Hadley Cantril, was one of the
co-directors of the Princeton Project since its inception.
As Michael J. Socolow wrote in the
Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Frank Stanton had,
devoted much of his life to understanding
the cultural, social, and psychological effects of the mass media.
Stanton was the president of CBS from 1946 until
1973, during which he,
proved to be an effective corporate
strategist and a skillful political operator, not least of all
because he collaborated closely with the U.S. government, performing
propaganda tasks during the Second World War and the ensuing Cold War.
Stantons first job was in the advertising
industry, beginning in 1929 and cut short by the market crash, though
Stanton maintained that advertising,
was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
In school, Stanton studied business
administration and psychology, being particularly influenced by John B.
Watson, the developer of behaviorism, who himself went to go work for an
advertising agency.
Throughout his own life and career, Stanton
viewed himself as,
a behaviorist, a social scientist valuing
the application of psychological technique across a variety of human
endeavors.
Behaviorism was a brand of psychology which
emerged in response to the development of the field by social scientists
seeking to make scientific what was previously the realm of philosophy and
spirituality, drawing in political scientists, economists, sociologists, and
others.
The field of psychology had become more
prominent following World War I, after having proved its worth to power
interests in mobilizing, manipulating, and studying populations and their
perceptions. In 1929, the president of Yale, James Agnell, announced
the creation of the Yale Institute of Human Relations (IHR), with a generous
grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.
Agnell explained that the IHR was,
directly concerned with the problems of
mans individual and group conduct, out of which the purpose was to
correlate knowledge and coordinate technique in related fields that
greater progress may be made in the understanding of human life.
The IHR helped facilitate the rise of
behaviorism in psychology, as in the 1920s and 30s, social unrest was a
growing problem, and so psychologists attempted to promote themselves and
their field as a possible solution to these problems, as a scientific
psychology - or social psychology - could,
be instrumental for attaining democratic
social order and control.
Such a theory was based upon the view that the
individual was not well adjusted to a rapidly changing environment, and
therefore, with the help of psychology, the individual could be adjusted
successfully.
Of course, the notion that there is something
inherently problematic with society and the social order (and the hierarchy
upon which it was built) went unquestioned. In other words, it was not
society which needed to adjust to individuals and the population, but
rather the opposite. Psychologists and Yales Institute of Human Relations
would promote themselves as the solution to this complex problem.
Behaviorism was thus concerned with
environmental and behavior control in human relations. This influenced not
only Frank Stanton, but other key officials who were involved in the
Princeton Radio Project, including Paul Lazarsfeld.
Frank Stanton eventually got a job at CBS following some research he had
done on radio audiences and had sent to CBS headquarters.
In 1935, Stanton was the third employee hired by
CBS for the research division, concerned largely with the ability of
advertisers to sell to radio listeners. As Stanton explained in 1936, the
contribution of psychology to radio research,
should be largely one of technique,
adding: It isnt enough to know what programs are heard and preferred.
We want to know why they are listened to and liked, and furthermore, we
want to quantify influence.
Weeks later, Stanton - with the suggestion of
Hadley Cantril - wrote a draft memo of a research proposal for the
Rockefeller Foundation, out of which would come to Office of Radio Research
at Princeton.
The Princeton Radio Project, established with Rockefeller funding and
directed by Paul Lazarsfeld, Cantril, and Stanton, focused on studying the
uses and effects of radio communications upon the population, and almost
exclusively led to the field of mass communications research.
Theodor Adorno, a critical theorist whom
Lazarsfeld invited to join the Princeton Radio Project ran into several
problems during his research with his associates. Lazarsfeld brought Adorno
into the project hoping that he could bridge the gap between American and
European approaches to research.
Adorno, however, sought to understand not simply
the effects of radio in mass communications, but the role played by the
researcher - or expert - in the social order itself. This put him in
direct conflict with the project and its philosophy.
For Adorno, wrote Slack and Allor,
not only the processes of communication but
the practice of communication research itself had to be viewed
critically.
Reflecting upon his experience some decades
later, Adorno wrote that,
there appeared to be little room for such
social research in the framework of the Princeton Project.
He noted:
Its charter, which came from the
Rockefeller Foundation, expressly stipulated that the investigations
must be performed within the limits of the commercial radio system
prevailing in the United States.
Thus,
the system itself, its cultural and
sociological consequences and its social and economic presuppositions
were not to be analyzed
I was disturbed.
Shortly after World War II and into the 1950s,
the U.S. State Department became increasingly interested in the subject of
propaganda, or what was termed information management and public
diplomacy.
Television was of particular interest in
promoting American state interests, specifically those defined by the Cold
War.
Francis Russell, the director of the
State Departments Public Affairs (PA) division from 1945 to 1953, noted
that,
propaganda abroad is indispensable in the
Cold War, but that the State Department had, diligently cultivated the
concept of PA as a service to the American people, a place where the
public can come to obtain information.
He explained his worry that,
if the American people ever get the idea
that the same high-powered propaganda machine used abroad was also at
work on them, the result will be disaster fir both the domestic and
overseas programs.
The role of the PA was not in a censorship
bureau, but as a dispenser of information, to which the media - largely
privately owned - would use as a consistent source for reporting,
re-printing press releases, and seeking official sources for comment.
Edward Barrett, another top official in
the PA division, later noted:
We really tried to stick to the truth and
tell nothing but the truth, but we didnt always tell the whole truth.
Nancy Bernhard, writing in the journal
Diplomatic History, explained this contradiction aptly:
While Americans defended commercial
broadcasting because it was free from Communistic government control,
commercial broadcasters voluntarily collaborated with the government
information services in the name of anticommunism. 'Free' broadcasters
volunteered as a virtually official information agency.
It was no surprise, then, that government
information programs used the specific talents of corporate tycoons in the
media world, bringing in talent from networks, advertising agencies, public
relations agencies, and marketing bureaus.
The State Department established a number of
advisory boards to monitor its public affairs operations, largely made
up of industry and corporate officials. Among the influential board members
was Frank Stanton.
When Eisenhower came to power, a new agency was created to handle
information and cultural programs previously undertaken by the State
Department, the US Information Agency (USIA), established in 1953.
In attempting to create a terminology to
describe the activities of the USIA and its relationship to foreign policy
goals - without using the obvious term propaganda - the term public
diplomacy was commonly used.
Frank Stanton, who left CBS in 1973,
subsequently chaired a research report by the prominent American think tank,
the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in 1975, entitled,
International Information Education and Cultural Relations -
Recommendations for the Future.
The report recommended that the international
information and cultural programs [of the U.S. government] deserve all
possible support in the years ahead, that they have demonstrated their
success and are therefore an exceptional investment of government energy and
the taxpayers dollar.
While head of CBS, Stanton developed relationships with American presidents,
whose Cold War strategies he would help promote through his network. When
Kennedy became president, he offered Frank Stanton the job as head of the
United States Information Agency (USIA), which Stanton declined (though
recommended the appointment of Edward R. Murrow, a prominent journalist with
CBS, whom Stanton had no lack of problems with).
In fact, in 1958, Edward R. Murrow
delivered a speech before the Radio-Television News Directors Association
in which he implicitly indicted Stanton for the way in which he managed
CBS, stating:
The top management of the networks
has
been trained in advertising, research, or show business
by the nature
of the corporate structure, [these managers] also make the final and
crucial decisions having to do with news and public affairs. Frequently
they have neither the time nor the competence to do this.
Stanton developed a reputation as a trustworthy
propagandist for the Cold War, but was not unwilling to flex his own power
when confronted with state power, such as when President Lyndon Johnson,
angry at specific coverage of Vietnam on CBS, called up Stanton and stated,
Frank, are you trying to fuck your
country?
Stanton refused to budge on his coverage under
pressure from the president.
Yet still, he remained a propagandist, and even
participated in the CIAs program to infiltrate the domestic media, with
general knowledge of the Agencys program with CBS, though according to one
CIA agent involved in the matter, he didnt want to know the fine points.
Stanton, however, was ultimately a corporation man.
Not only did he help in the development of the
governments official propaganda systems, but he was a key figure in the
promotion of the corporatization of news and information.
Thus, for
Stanton, information management was not simply to be done in the interests
of the state, but also - and arguably primarily - in the interests of
corporations.
In Stantons own words,
since we are advertiser supported we must
take into account the general objectives and desires of advertisers as a
whole.
Stanton was not the only executive to voice such
views, as one executive at NBC as early as 1940, declared,
we should make money on our news.
The Social Control
Society: A Background to Democratic Propaganda
One of the primary institutions of social control is the educational system.
For primary and secondary educational
institutions, the original objective was to foster a strong sense of
national identity, bringing a cohesive world view to the development of a
national citizenry, and thus, to establish a system of social control.
For university education, the original and
evolving intend had been to develop an elite capable of managing society,
and thus, to produce the controllers and technicians of society, itself.
As the modern university underwent a major
transformation in late 19th century America, it sought to apply the
potential of the sciences to the social world, and thus, in a society
undergoing rapid industrialization, urbanization, poverty, immigration,
labour unrest, and new forms of communication, the social sciences were
developed with an objective of producing social engineers and technicians
for a new society of social control.
The major industrial and financial elites had a direct role to play in the
transformation of this educational system, and a substantial interest in the
ideologies which would emerge from them.
As Andrew Carnegie wrote in 1889, at the top of
the list of charitable deeds to undertake was,
the founding of a university by men
enormously rich, such men as must necessarily be few in any country.
It was in this context, of robber barons seeking
to remake education, that we see the founding of several of Americas top
universities, many of which were named after their robber baron founders,
such as Stanford (after Leland Stanford), Cornell (after Ezra Cornell), and
Johns Hopkins, who owned the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.
This new class of industrialists, who emerged out of the Civil War in
America,
challenged the position of the old
propertied, pre-industrial elite. This struggle crystallized in
particular around the reform of the educational system that had
legitimated the old elites domination.
The modern university was born out of this
struggle between elites, with the old educational system based upon
religious and moral values,
and the making of gentlemen, while the
new education focused on the importance of management or
administration as well as public service, [and] the advancement of
knowledge through original investigation.
John D. Rockefeller founded the
University of Chicago in 1891, and the President of the University,
initiated a new disciplinary system, which
was enormously influential.
Ultimately, it,
led to the formation of the department
structure of the American university, which was internationally unique,
and was later exported around the world with the help of American
foundations.
This disciplinary system consisted of separating
politics from economics (rejecting the notion of political economy and its
ideologies), as ideology was,
deemed unscientific and inappropriate in
social sciences and political scientists have increasingly seen their
function as service to the powerful, rather than providing leadership to
populist or socialist movements.
Nicolas Guilhot wrote in the journal
Critical Sociology that since,
social reform was inevitable, these
industrialists chose to invest in the definition and scientific
treatment of the social questions of their time, and subsequently,
they promoted reformist solutions that did not threaten the
capitalistic nature of the social order, and instead constructed a
private alternative to socialism.
Social control was not simply seen as the means
through which a society - as it exists - could be maintained, but more often
sought to preserve elements of that society (such as its hierarchical
structure, the position of the elites) through periods of profound social
change. In this sense, the question was,
whether the processes of social control are
able to maintain the social order [hierarchy] while transformation and
social change take place.
The United States was viewed,
as the laboratory for the study of
transitional society in the framework of a rapidly changing social
structure, and therefore, at a time when sociology was being
established as an intellectual and academic discipline, the United
States could be viewed as a microcosm of social change and disorder.
The sociologist Edward A. Ross was the
first to popularize the concept of social control in the American Journal of
Sociology in 1896 and 1898, and later in his 1901 book, Social Control.
Ross,
viewed individuals as objects of societys
domination, and suggested that society had to establish order by
channeling the behavior of its members into orderly relations.
Ross, largely influenced by Gabriel Tarde,
did not believe that individuals were rational, but rather, that they would
need to be controlled in one fashion or another.
As some sociologists lamented in the 1920s,
all social problems turn out finally to be
problems of social control, and the study of society was the study of
social control.
Sociology largely emerged from the University of
Chicago (founded by John D. Rockefeller), with the worlds first department
of sociology founded in 1892.
The sociologists who rose within and out of the
University of Chicago made up what was known as the Chicago School of
Sociology.
The school developed the most influential
sociologists in the nation, including George Herbert Mead and W.I.
Thomas, two scholars who had profound influence on the development of
the concept of social control, and sociologists became,
reform-oriented liberals, not radical
revolutionaries or conservative cynics.
The American Journal of Sociology was founded
out of the University of Chicago by Albion Small, who was the head
professor of the department of sociology, and became the editor of the
journal for thirty years from 1895-1925.
Between 1915 and 1940, the University of Chicago
was the dominant force in sociology in the United States, and,
the dominance of the Sociology Department
was representative of the social sciences at Chicago during that
period.
The school was largely made the center of not
only sociology, but many areas of the social sciences, due to funding from
outside sources, namely the major philanthropic foundations created by the
Robber Baron industrialists in the early 20th century.
The foundations became, in effect, engines of
social engineering and perhaps the most effective institutions in the
application of social control in modern society.
The Foundations of
Social Control
The new industrial elite accumulated millions and even hundreds of millions
by the end of the 19th century:
Andrew Carnegie was worth roughly $300
million after he sold Carnegie Steel to J.P. Morgan in 1901, and by
1913, John D. Rockefeller was estimated to have a personal worth of $900
million.
In the late 1880s, Rockefeller met Frederick
T. Gates, a minister, educator, and administrator in the Baptist Church
when they were negotiating the founding of a new university, which
resulted with a pledge of $600,000 from Rockefeller to found the
University of Chicago in 1889.
At this time, Rockefeller hired Frederick T.
Gates as his associate in charge of Rockefellers philanthropic
ventures. Gates became central in inculcating the notion of scientific
benevolence within Rockefellers philanthropies.
As Frederick T.
Gates wrote in his autobiography,
I gradually developed and introduced in all
his charities the principle of scientific giving.
Gates advised Rockefeller to form a series of
self-perpetuating philanthropies.
The circumstances in which the Rockefeller Foundation emerged are notable.
In 1913, a coal strike began at a Colorado mine owned by the Rockefellers in
the small mining town of Ludlow, where roughly 11,000 workers (mostly Greek,
Italian, and Serbian immigrants) went on strike against the,
feudal domination of their lives in towns
completely controlled by the mining companies.
Repression quickly followed, culminating in what
became known as
the Ludlow Massacre in 1914, with
the Rockefellers hiring
the National Guard to attack the strikers and destroy their tent city,
machine gunning the crowd and setting fire to tents, one of which was
discovered to have housed eleven children and two women, all of whom were
killed by the fire.
The Congressional Walsh Commission was founded to investigate the activities
which led to violent labour repression at the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company
in Ludlow, though the scope of the Commission was expanded to study
philanthropic foundations themselves.
The Commissions founder, Frank P. Walsh,
explained:
the creation of the Rockefeller and other
foundations was the beginning of an effort to perpetuate the present
position of predatory wealth through the corruption of sources of public
information
[and] that if not checked by legislation, these foundations
will be used as instruments to change to form of government of the U.S.
at a future date, and there is even a hint that there is a fear of a
monarchy.
In 1916,
the Walsh Commission produced its final
report, the Manly Report (after the research director, Basil M. Manly),
which concluded that the foundations were so grave a menace to society,
that it would be desirable to recommend their abolition.
Frank Walsh referred to foundations as a menace
to the welfare of society.
As the Walsh Commission began their work, the Rockefeller Foundation sought
to join forces with other major corporate leaders to advance their formation
of ideology, and attended a conference,
held between representatives of some
of the largest financial interests in the United States.
This conference resulted in two approaches being
pushed forward in terms of seeking to,
educate the citizenry in pro-capitalistic
ideology and thus relieve unrest.
One view was the interpretation that the public
was provided with,
poor quality of facts and interpretation
available on social and economic issues.
Thus, they felt there was a need for a
publicity bureau to provide a constant stream of correct information
targeted at the lower and middle classes.
The Rockefeller Foundation agreed that a
publicity bureau was a good strategy, but added that what was also needed
was a permanent research organization to manufacture knowledge on these
subjects.
A publicity bureau would correct popular
misinformation, while a research organization would study the causes of
social and economic evils, though of course avoiding problematic
considerations of institutional analysis or radical critiques. They were
instead to focus on disinterested and detached studies of social
problems, portraying themselves as scientists and technicians for society,
focused on reform and social control.
Rockefeller interests quickly undertook both strategies.
While the Foundation was engaged in the
manufacture of ideology (which specifically states that it is
non-ideological, meaning that it supports power), the corporate arm of the
Rockefeller empire hired the first public relations man, Ivy Lee, a
Progressive era journalist.
The Foundation hired the Canadian labour expert,
William Lyon Mackenzie King (who would later become Canadas
longest-serving Prime Minister) to manage labour relations, promoting
company unions over autonomous unions, thus undermining the freedom of
labour to organize and oppose the social order as a whole, bringing them
firmly within the corporate-state ideology and institutions.
Ivy Lee, for his part, attempted to undertake damage control for
the Rockefellers, who were widely despised at the time, acting as a PR man,
disseminating communiqués to media and educators attempting to cultivate
middle-class allies.
His efforts at stemming animosity toward the
Rockefellers following Ludlow failed, but for years he continued to present
the human side of the Rockefellers, earning him the rather unfavorable
nickname Poison Ivy.
While Lees specific efforts were unsuccessful, the ideas behind them
continued to grow and evolve.
Two major social engineering projects were
underway:
-
one, the manufacture of ideology,
largely the initiative of philanthropic foundations (and the social
sciences)
-
the other, public relations as a modern
form of propaganda
Both of these social engineering projects were
designed to ensure social control through social engineering, and both were
to have a profound impact upon both the definition and function of modern
democracies.
Through the educational system, the social sciences, philanthropic
foundations, public relations, advertising, marketing, and the media,
America and the industrialized states of the world developed a unique and
complex system of social control and propaganda for the 20th
century and into the 21st.
It is imperative to recognize and understand
this complex system if we are to challenge and change it.
