It's appalling to hear the Washington
bureaucrats
and their media allies trash Edward Snowden as a
traitor,
when it's our leaders and the NSA who have
betrayed us,
writes Kirsten Powers.
Hell hath no fury like the Washington
establishment scorned.
Since Edward Snowden came forward to
identify himself as the leaker of the National Security Agency spying
programs, the D.C. mandarins have been working overtime to discredit the
man many view as a hero for revealing crucial information the government
had wrongfully kept secret.
Apparently, if you think hiding information
about spying on Americans is bad, you are misguided.
The real problem is that Snowden
didnt understand that his role is to sit and be quiet while the "best
and the brightest" keep Americans in the dark about government snooping
on private citizens.
By refusing to play this role, Snowden has
been
called a "traitor" by House Majority Leader John Boehner.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein called the
leaks "an act of treason." The fury among the protectors of the status
quo is so great that you have longtime Washington Post columnist
Richard Cohen
smearing Snowden as a "cross-dressing Little Red Riding Hood."
The New York Timess David Brooks
lamented that Snowden, who put himself in peril for the greater good,
was too "individualistic."
It seems that he wasnt sufficiently indoctrinated to blindly worship
the establishment institutions that have routinely failed us.
Brooks argued that,
"for society to function well, there
have to be basic levels of trust and cooperation, a respect for
institutions and deference to common procedures."
This is backward. Its the institutions that
need to demonstrate respect for the public they allegedly serve.
If Snowden or any other American is
skeptical of institutional power, it is not due to any personal failing
on their part. The lack of respect is a direct outgrowth of the bad
behavior of the nations institutions, behavior that has undermined
Americans trust in them.
According to Gallups "confidence in
institutions" poll, trust is at an historic low, with Congress clocking
in at a 13 percent approval rating in 2012. Yes, this is the same
Congress that has "oversight" of the government spying programs.
When one major institution (the Washington
media establishment) so seamlessly partners with another (the U.S.
government) in trashing a whistleblower, its not hard to understand why
Americans might be jaded.
The New Yorkers Jeffrey Toobin
wrote that Snowden is,
"a grandiose narcissist who deserves to
be in prison."
MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell complained
about Snowdens
naivet√© and "maturity level," as if only a child would believe the
government should be transparent about its activity.
Politicos Roger Simon
called Snowden,
"the slacker who came in from the cold,"
with "all the qualifications to become a grocery bagger."
That people feel comfortable sneering about
grocery workers - a respectable job - and writing off Snowdens years
working as a security guard as sloth tells you a bit about the culture
of the nations capital, doesnt it?
Some
members of the Washington political elite, like
John Boehner and Dianne Feinstein, have called
Edward Snowden a "traitor" who deserves to be
prosecuted
Some members of the Washington political
elite, like John Boehner and Dianne Feinstein, have called Edward
Snowden a "traitor" who deserves to be prosecuted.
But he didnt finish high school! Actually,
Snowden earned a general equivalency diploma (GED), but that hasnt
stopped his detractors from spitting this accusation like an epithet. On
Wednesday's Late Show With David Letterman,
Tom Brokaw dismissed Snowden as "a high school dropout who is a
military washout."
On Tuesday, Sen. Susan Collins,
mocked the 29-year-old man as,
"a high school drop-out who had little
maturity [and] had not successfully completed anything he had
undertaken."
Yes, if only he had gone to Harvard or Yale
like our last four presidents, who have done such a bang-up job running
the country. By the way, according to Glenn Greenwald, Snowden actually
worked as a contractor for four years at the NSA, which suggests
some level of specialized skill.
It says something about the lack of a
positive case for keeping the NSA spying programs secret that the main
line of defense is to attack Snowden for lacking the proper credentials
to speak out against the government.
Apparently we are supposed to "respect
institutions" so much that we never feel entitled to information about
how they operate, even when it involves our private communications.
Only because of Snowden do we know that our
government is storing records of our phone data that can be mined for
God only knows how long. This same government opted to
not prosecute its workers who destroyed CIA interrogation records
that might have implicated the government in law breaking.
Does this seem right?
Director of National Intelligence James
Clapper
blatantly lied to Congress about the activity of the NSA, and there
seems to be no ramifications. Yet the Washington establishment wants to
put Snowden in jail and throw away the key for telling the truth.
We are told to blindly respect an
institution that persecutes whistleblowers for leaks of overclassified
government information while watching the Obama administrations
leaking of secret government information to aggrandize the president
during his reelection campaign.
So, please tell us more about how we should
have more respect for our institutions.
Whether one supports or opposes the NSA
spying programs, Snowden has done a public service by exposing them and
igniting a debate about government surveillance that even the president
says he welcomes. There is no reason for the mere existence of either
program to have been classified by the Most Transparent Administration
in History.
The claims that terrorists have been tipped
off by these revelations are not credible. Nobody seriously believes
that until now terrorists didnt know the American government is
monitoring their email and phone calls.
Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) told MSNBC
Wednesday,
"I don't see how [Snowdens leaks]
compromises the security of this country whatsoever."
In his 2003 book, Why Societies Need
Dissent, liberal law professor Cass Sunstein pointed out
that, in society,
"a single dissenter or voice of sanity
is likely to have a huge impact."
But the problem for dissenters is that they
"have little incentive to speak out, because they would gain nothing
from dissenting" and in fact might be punished.
Snowden knew this and he did it anyway.
He clearly understands something that those
screaming "traitor" do not: the allegiance we have as Americans is to
the Constitution, not the institution of government.
Snowden summed it up best when he
told a South China Morning Post reporter this week,
"Im neither a traitor nor a hero. Im
an American."
NSA Whistleblower - Why I Did It
He wanted his
identity revealed, so on Sunday The Guardian
newspaper told the world that their NSA
whistleblower is Edward Snowden, 'a 29-year-old
former technical assistant for the CIA and current
employee of the defence contractor Booz Allen
Hamilton.' In this video, Snowden explains why he
leaked top secret information.
