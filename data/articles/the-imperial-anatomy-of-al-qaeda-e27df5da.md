The CIAs Drug-Running Terrorists and The "Arc of Crisis"
September 5, 2010
Introduction
As the 9th anniversary of 9/11 nears, and the war on terror continues to be
waged and grows in ferocity and geography, it seems all the more imperative
to return to the events of that fateful September morning and re-examine the
reasons for war and the nature of the stated culprit, Al-Qaeda.
The events of 9/11 pervade the American and indeed the world imagination as
an historical myth.
The events of that day and those leading up to it remain
largely unknown and little understood by the general public, apart from the
disturbing images repeated ad nauseam in the media.
The facts and troubled
truths of that day are lost in the folklore of the 9/11 myth: that the
largest attack carried out on American ground was orchestrated by 19 Muslims
armed with box cutters and urged on by religious fundamentalism, all under
the direction of
Osama bin Laden, the leader of a global terrorist network
called al-Qaeda, based out of a cave in Afghanistan.
The myth sweeps aside the facts and complex nature of terror, al-Qaeda, the
American empire and literally defies the laws of physics. As John F. Kennedy
once said,
The greatest enemy of the truth is not the lie
- deliberate,
contrived, and dishonest - but the myth - persistent, pervasive, and
unrealistic.
This three-part series on The Imperial Anatomy of Al-Qaeda examines the
geopolitical historical origins and nature of what we today know as
al-Qaeda, which is in fact an Anglo-American intelligence network of
terrorist assets used to advance American and NATO imperial objectives in
various regions around the world.
Part 1 examines the origins of the intelligence network known as the
Safari
Club, which financed and organized an international conglomerate of
terrorists, the CIAs role in the global drug trade, the emergence of the
Taliban and the origins of al-Qaeda.
The Safari Club
Following Nixons resignation as President, Gerald Ford became the new US
President in 1974.
Henry Kissinger remained as Secretary of State and Ford
brought into his administration two names that would come to play important
roles in the future of the American Empire:
-
Donald Rumsfeld as Fords Chief
of Staff
-
Dick Cheney, as Deputy Assistant to the President.
-
The Vice
President was Nelson Rockefeller, David Rockefellers brother.
When Donald Rumsfeld was promoted to Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney was promoted to
Chief of Staff. Ford had also appointed a man named George H.W. Bush as CIA
Director.
In 1976, a coalition of intelligence agencies was formed, which was called
the Safari Club. This marked the discreet and highly covert coordination
among various intelligence agencies, which would last for decades. It formed
at a time when the CIA was embroiled in domestic scrutiny over the Watergate
scandal and a Congressional investigation into covert CIA activities,
forcing the CIA to become more covert in its activities.
In 2002, the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Turki bin Faisal gave a speech
in which he stated that in response to the CIAs need for more discretion,
a group of countries got together in the hope of fighting Communism and
established what was called the Safari Club. The Safari Club included
France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Iran [under the Shah]. [1]
However,
The Safari Club needed a network of banks to finance its
intelligence operations. With the official blessing of George H.W. Bush as
the head of the CIA, Saudi intelligence chief, Kamal Adham, transformed a
small Pakistani merchant bank, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI), into a world-wide money-laundering machine, buying banks around the
world to create the biggest clandestine money network in history. [2]
As CIA director,
George H.W. Bush,
cemented strong relations with the
intelligence services of both Saudi Arabia and the shah of Iran. He worked
closely with Kamal Adham, the head of Saudi intelligence, brother-in-law of
King Faisal and an early BCCI insider.
Adham had previously acted as a
channel between [Henry] Kissinger and [Egyptian President] Anwar Sadat in
1972.
In 1976, Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia formed the Safari Club,
to
conduct through their own intelligence agencies operations that were now
difficult for the CIA, which was largely organized by the head of French
intelligence, Alexandre de Marenches.[3]
The Arc of Crisis and the Iranian Revolution
When Jimmy Carter became President in 1977, he appointed over two-dozen
members of
the Trilateral Commission to his administration, which was an
international think tank formed by
Zbigniew Brzezinski and
David Rockefeller
in 1973.
Brzezinski had invited Carter to join the Trilateral Commission,
and when Carter became President, Brzezinski became National Security
Adviser; Cyrus Vance, also a member of the Commission, became Secretary of
State; and Samuel Huntington, another Commission member, became Coordinator
of National Security and Deputy to Brzezinski.
Author and researcher Peter
Dale Scott deserves much credit for his comprehensive analysis of the events
leading up to and during the Iranian Revolution in his book, The Road to
9/11, which provides much of the information below.
Samuel Huntington and Zbigniew Brzezinski were to determine the US policy
position in the Cold War, and the US-Soviet policy they created was termed,
Cooperation and Competition, in which Brzezinski would press for
Cooperation when talking to the press, yet, privately push for
competition. So, while Secretary of State Cyrus Vance was pursuing détente
with the Soviet Union, Brzezinski was pushing for American supremacy over
the Soviet Union. Brzezinski and Vance would come to disagree on almost
every issue.[4]
In 1978, Zbigniew Brzezinski gave a speech in which he stated,
An arc of
crisis stretches along the shores of the Indian Ocean, with fragile social
and political structures in a region of vital importance to us threatened
with fragmentation. The resulting political chaos could well be filled by
elements hostile to our values and sympathetic to our adversaries.
The Arc
of Crisis stretched from Indochina to southern Africa, although, more
specifically, the particular area of focus was,
the nations that stretch
across the southern flank of the Soviet Union from the Indian subcontinent
to Turkey, and southward through the Arabian Peninsula to the Horn of
Africa.
Further, the,
center of gravity of this arc is Iran, the world's
fourth largest oil producer and for more than two decades a citadel of U.S.
military and economic strength in the Middle East. Now it appears that the
37-year reign of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi is almost over, ended by months
of rising civil unrest and revolution. [5]
With rising discontent in the region,
There was this idea that the Islamic
forces could be used against the Soviet Union. The theory was, there was an
arc of crisis, and so an arc of Islam could be mobilized to contain the
Soviets. It was a Brzezinski concept. [6]
A month prior to Brzezinskis
speech, in November of 1978,
President Carter named the Bilderberg groups
George Ball, another member of the Trilateral Commission, to head a special
White House Iran task force under the National Security Councils
Brzezinski.
Further,
Ball recommended that Washington drop support for the
Shah of Iran and support the fundamentalist Islamic opposition of Ayatollah
Khomeini. [7]
George Balls visit to Iran was a secret mission.[8]
Throughout 1978, the Shah was under the impression that the Carter
administration was plotting to topple his regime.
In 1978, the Queen and
Shahs wife, told Manouchehr Ganji, a minister in the Shahs government,
that,
I wanted to tell you that the Americans are maneuvering to bring down
the Shah, and she continued saying that she believed they even want to
topple the regime. [9]
The US Ambassador to Iran, William Sullivan, thought
that the revolution would succeed, and told this to Ramsey Clark, former US
Attorney General under the Johnson administration, as well as professor
Richard Falk, when they were visiting Sullivan in Iran in 1978.
Clark and
Falk then went from Iran to Paris, to visit Khomeini, who was there in
exile. James Bill, a Carter adviser, felt that,
a religious movement
brought about with the United States assistance would be a natural friend
of the United States. [10]
Also interesting is the fact that the British BBC broadcast pro-Khomeini
Persian-language programs daily in Iran, as a subtle form of propaganda,
which,
gave credibility to the perception of United States and British
support of Khomeini. [11]
The BBC refused to give the Shah a platform to
respond, and [r]epeated personal appeals from the Shah to the BBC yielded
no result. [12]
In the May 1979 meeting of
the Bilderberg Group, Bernard Lewis, a British
historian of great influence (hence, the Bilderberg membership), presented a
British-American strategy which,
endorsed the radical
Muslim Brotherhood
movement behind Khomeini, in order to promote balkanization of the entire
Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines.
Lewis argued that the
West should encourage autonomous groups such as the Kurds, Armenians,
Lebanese Maronites, Ethiopian Copts, Azerbaijani Turks, and so forth. The
chaos would spread in what he termed an Arc of Crisis, which would spill
over into the Muslim regions of the Soviet Union. [13]
Further, it would
prevent Soviet influence from entering the Middle East, as the Soviet Union
was viewed as an empire of atheism and godlessness:
essentially a secular
and immoral empire, which would seek to impose secularism across Muslim
countries.
So supporting radical Islamic groups would mean that the Soviet
Union would be less likely to have any influence or relations with Middle
Eastern countries, making the US a more acceptable candidate for developing
relations.
A 1979 article in Foreign Affairs, the journal of the
Council on Foreign
Relations, described the Arc of Crisis, saying that,
the Middle East
constitutes its central core. Its strategic position is unequalled: it is
the last major region of the Free World directly adjacent to the Soviet
Union, it holds in its subsoil about three-fourths of the proven and
estimated world oil reserves, and it is the locus of one of the most
intractable conflicts of the twentieth century: that of Zionism versus Arab
nationalism.
It went on to explain that post-war US policy in the region
was focused on containment of the Soviet Union, as well as access to the
regions oil.[14]
The article continued, explaining that the most obvious
division within
the Middle East is,
that which separates the Northern Tier
(Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan) from the Arab core, and that, After World War
II, Turkey and Iran were the two countries most immediately threatened by
Soviet territorial expansionism and political subversion. [15]
Ultimately,
the Northern Tier was assured of a serious and sustained American
commitment to save it from sharing the fate of Eastern Europe. [16]
While Khomeini was in Paris prior to the Revolution, a representative of the
French President organized a meeting between Khomeini and,
current world
powers, in which Khomeini made certain demands, such as, the shah's
removal from Iran and help in avoiding a coup d'état by the Iranian Army.
The Western powers, however,
were worried about the Soviet Union's
empowerment and penetration and a disruption in Iran's oil supply to the
west. Khomeini gave the necessary guarantees. These meetings and contacts
were taking place in January of 1979, just a few days before the Islamic
Revolution in February 1979. [17]
In February of 1979, Khomeini was flown
out of Paris on an Air France flight, to return to Iran, with the blessing
of Jimmy Carter. [18]
Ayatollah Khomeini named Mehdi Bazargan as prime
minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government on February 4, 1979. As
Khomeini had demanded during his Paris meeting in January 1979, that western
powers must help in avoiding a coup by the Iranian Army; in that same month,
the Carter administration, under the direction of Brzezinski, had begun
planning a military coup.[19]
Could this have been planned in the event that Khomeini was overthrown, the
US would quickly reinstate order, perhaps even place Khomeini back in power?
Interestingly, in January of 1979,
as the Shah was about to leave the
country, the American Deputy Commander in NATO, General Huyser, arrived and
over a period of a month conferred constantly with Iranian military leaders.
His influence may have been substantial on the military's decision not to
attempt a coup and eventually to yield to the Khomeini forces, especially if
press reports are accurate that he or others threatened to withhold military
supplies if a coup were attempted. [20]
No coup was subsequently undertaken,
and Khomeini came to power as the Ayatollah of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
As tensions increased among the population within Iran, the US sent
security advisers to Iran to pressure the Shahs SAVAK (secret police) to
implement a policy of ever more brutal repression, in a manner calculated
to maximize popular antipathy to the Shah. The Carter administration also
began publicly criticizing the Shahs human rights abuses.[21]
On September
6, 1978, the Shah banned demonstrations, and the following day, between 700
and 2000 demonstrators were gunned down, following advice from Brzezinski
to be firm. [22]
The US Ambassador to the UN, Andrew Young, a Trilateral Commission member,
said that,
Khomeini will eventually be hailed as a saint, and the US
Ambassador to Iran, William Sullivan, said, Khomeini is a Gandhi-like
figure, while Carters adviser, James Bill, said that Khomeini was a man of
impeccable integrity and honesty. [23]
The Shah was also very sick in late 1978 and early 1979. So the Shah fled
Iran in January of 1979 to the Bahamas, allowing for the revolution to take
place.
It is especially interesting to understand the relationship between
David Rockefeller and the Shah of Iran.
-
David Rockefellers personal
assistant, Joseph V. Reed, had been assigned to handle the shahs finances
and his personal needs
-
Robert Armao, who worked for Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller, was sent to act as the shahs public relations agent and
lobbyist
-
Benjamin H. Kean, a longtime associate of Chase Manhattan
Bank chairman David Rockefeller, and David Rockefellers personal
physician, who was sent to Mexico when the shah was there, and advised that
he be treated at an American hospital [24]
It is important to note that Rockefeller interests had directed U.S. policy
in Iran since the CIA coup of 1953. [25]
Following the Shahs flight from
Iran, there were increased pressures within the United States by a handful
of powerful people to have the Shah admitted to the United States.
These
individuals were,
-
Zbigniew Brzezinski
-
former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger
-
John J. McCloy, former statesman and senior member of the
Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign
Relations, who was also a lawyer for Chase Manhattan
-
and of course..., David
Rockefeller.[26]
Chase Manhattan Bank had more interests in Iran than any other US bank.
In
fact, the Shah had,
ordered that all his governments major operating
accounts be held at Chase and that letters of credit for the purchase of oil
be handled exclusively through Chase. The bank also became the agent and
lead manager for many of the loans to Iran. In short, Iran became the crown
jewel of Chases international banking portfolio. [27]
The Iranian interim government, headed by Prime Minister
Bazargan, collapsed
in November of 1979, when Iranian hostages seized the US Embassy in Teheran.
However, there is much more to this event than meets the eye. During the
time of the interim government (February, 1979 to November, 1979), several
actions were undertaken which threatened some very powerful interests who
had helped the Ayatollah into power.
Chase Manhattan Bank faced a liquidity crisis as there had been billions in
questionable loans to Iran funneled through Chase.[28] Several of Chases
loans were possibly illegal under the Iranian constitution. [29]
Further,
in February of 1979, once the interim government was put in power, it began
to take steps to market its oil independently of the Western oil majors.
Also, the interim government wanted Chase Manhattan to return Iranian
assets, which Rockefeller put at more than $1 billion in 1978, although some
estimates ran much higher, which could have created a liquidity crisis for
the bank which already was coping with financial troubles. [30]
With the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran, President Carter took
moves to freeze Iranian financial assets.
As David Rockefeller wrote in his
book,
Carters freeze of official Iranian assets protected our [Chase
Manhattans] position, but no one at Chase played a role in convincing the
administration to institute it. [31]
In February of 1979, Iran had been taking,
steps to market its oil
independently of the Western oil majors. In 1979, as in 1953, a freeze of
Iranian assets made this action more difficult. [32]
This was significant
for Chase Manhattan not simply because of the close interlocking of the
board with those of oil companies, not to mention Rockefeller himself, who
is patriarch of the family whose name is synonymous with oil, but also
because Chase exclusively handled all the letters of credit for the purchase
of Iranian oil.[33]
The Shah being accepted into the United States, under public pressure from
Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller, precipitated the
hostage crisis, which occurred on November 4. Ten days later, Carter froze
all Iranian assets in US banks, on the advice of his Treasury Secretary,
William Miller.
Miller just happened to have ties to Chase Manhattan
Bank.[34]
Although Chase Manhattan directly benefited from the seizure of Iranian
assets, the reasoning behind the seizure as well as the events leading up to
it, such as a hidden role for the Anglo-Americans behind the Iranian
Revolution, bringing the Shah to America, which precipitated the hostage
crisis, cannot simply be relegated to personal benefit for Chase.
There were
larger designs behind this crisis. So the 1979 crises in Iran cannot simply
be pawned off as a spur of the moment undertaking, but rather should be seen
as quick actions taken upon a perceived opportunity. The opportunity was the
rising discontent within Iran at the Shah; the quick actions were in
covertly pushing the country into Revolution.
In 1979,
effectively restricting the access of Iran to the global oil
market, the Iranian assets freeze became a major factor in the huge oil
price increases of 1979 and 1981. [35]
Added to this, in 1979, British
Petroleum cancelled major oil contracts for oil supply, which along with
cancellations taken by Royal Dutch Shell, drove the price of oil up
higher.[36]
With the first major oil price rises in 1973 (urged on by US
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger), the Third World was forced to borrow
heavily from US and European banks to finance development. With the second
oil price shocks of 1979, the
US Federal Reserve, with
Paul Volcker as its
new Chairman, (himself having served a career under David Rockefeller at
Chase Manhattan), dramatically raised interest rates from 2% in the late 70s
to 18% in the early 80s.
Developing nations could not afford to pay such
interest on their loans, and thus the 1980s debt crisis spread throughout
the Third World, with
the IMF and
World Bank coming to the rescue with
their Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs), which ensured western control
over the developing worlds economies.[37]
Covertly, the United States helped a radical Islamist government come to
power in Iran, the center of the Arc of Crisis, and then immediately
stirred up conflict and war in the region. Five months before Iraq invaded
Iran, in April of 1980, Zbigniew Brzezinski openly declared the willingness
of the US to work closely with Iraq. Two months before the war, Brzezinski
met with Saddam Hussein in Jordan, where he gave support for the
destabilization of Iran.[38]
While Saddam was in Jordan, he also met with
three senior CIA agents, which was arranged by King Hussein of Jordan.
He
then went to meet with King Fahd in Saudi Arabia, informing him of his plans
to invade Iran, and then met with the King of Kuwait to inform him of the
same thing. He gained support from America, and financial and arms support
from the Arab oil producing countries. Arms to Iraq were funneled through
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.[39]
The war lasted until 1988 and resulted
in over a million deaths.
This was the emergence of the strategy of tension in the Arc of Crisis,
in particular, the covert support (whether in arming, training, or
financing) of radical Islamic elements to foment violence and conflict in a
region. It was the old imperial tactic of divide and conquer: pit the
people against each other so that they cannot join forces against the
imperial power.
This violence and radical Islamism would further provide the
pretext for which the US and its imperial allies could then engage in war
and occupation within the region, all the while securing its vast economic
and strategic interests.
The Arc of Crisis in Afghanistan
- The Safari Club in Action
In 1978, the progressive Taraki government in Afghanistan managed to incur
the anger of the United States due to its egalitarian and collectivist
economic policies. [40]
The Afghan government was widely portrayed in the
West as Communist and thus, a threat to US national security. The
government, did, however, undertake friendly policies and engagement with
the Soviet Union, but was not a Communist government.
In 1978, as the new government came to power, almost immediately the US
began covertly funding rebel groups through the CIA.[41] In 1979, Zbigniew
Brzezinski worked closely with his aid from the CIA, Robert Gates (who is
currently Secretary of Defense), in shifting President Carters Islamic
policy. As Brzezinski said in a 1998 interview with a French publication:
According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen
began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded
Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979.
But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is
completely otherwise: Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter
signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet
regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which
I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet
military intervention.[42]
Brzezinski elaborated, saying he,
Knowingly increased the probability that
[the Soviets] would invade, and he recalled writing to Carter on the day of
the Soviet invasion that, We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR
its Vietnam war. Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war
unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about the
demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.
When asked
about the repercussions for such support in fostering the rise of Islamic
fundamentalism, Brzezinski responded,
What is most important to the history
of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some
stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the
cold war? [43]
As author Peter Dale Scott pointed out in, The Road to 9/11:
For generations in both Afghanistan and the Soviet Muslim Republics the
dominant form of Islam had been local and largely Sufi. The decision to work
with the Saudi and Pakistani secret services meant that billions of CIA and
Saudi dollars would ultimately be spent in programs that would help enhance
the globalistic and Wahhabistic jihadism that are associated today with al
Qaeda.[44]
Hafizullah Amin, a top official in Tarakis government, who many believed to
be a CIA asset, orchestrated a coup in September of 1979, and,
executed Taraki, halted the reforms, and murdered, jailed, or exiled thousands of
Taraki supporters as he moved toward establishing a fundamentalist Islamic
state. But within two months, he was overthrown by PDP remnants including
elements within the military. [45]
The Soviets also intervened in order to
replace Amin, who was seen as unpredictable and extremist with the more
moderate Barbak Karmal. [46]
The Soviet invasion thus prompted the US national security establishment to
undertake the largest covert operation in history. When Ronald Reagan
replaced Jimmy Carter in 1981, the covert assistance to the Afghan
Mujahideen not only continued on the path set by Brzezinski but it rapidly
accelerated, as did the overall strategy in the Arc of Crisis.
When Reagan
became President, his Vice President became
George H.W. Bush, who, as CIA
director during the Ford administration, had helped establish the Safari
Club intelligence network and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI) in Pakistan.
In the,
campaign to aid the Afghan rebels... BCCI
clearly emerged as a U.S. intelligence asset, and CIA Director, Casey began
to use the outside - the Saudis, the Pakistanis, BCCI - to run what they
couldnt get through Congress. [BCCI president] Abedi had the money to
help, and the CIA director had met repeatedly with the president of BCCI.[47]
Thus, in 1981, Director Casey of the CIA worked with Saudi Prince Turki bin
Faisal who ran the Saudi intelligence agency GID, and the Pakistani ISI,
to
create a foreign legion of jihadi Muslims or so-called Arab Afghans.
This
idea had,
originated in the elite Safari Club that had been created by
French intelligence chief Alexandre de Marenches. [48]
In 1986, the CIA backed a plan by the Pakistani ISI to recruit people from
around the world to join the Afghan jihad.
Subsequently:
More than 100,000 Islamic militants were trained in Pakistan between 1986
and 1992, in camps overseen by CIA and MI6, with the SAS [British Special
Forces] training future al-Qaida and Taliban fighters in bomb-making and
other black arts. Their leaders were trained at a CIA camp in Virginia. This
was called Operation Cyclone and continued long after the Soviets had
withdrawn in 1989.[49]
CIA funding for the operations was funneled through General Zia and the ISI
in Pakistan. [50]
Interestingly, Robert Gates, who previously served as
assistant to Brzezinski in the National Security Council, stayed on in the
Reagan-Bush administration as executive assistant to CIA director Casey, and
who is currently Secretary of Defense.
The Global Drug Trade and the CIA
As a central facet of the covert financing and training of the Afghan
Mujahideen, the role of the drug trade became invaluable. The
global drug
trade has long been used by empires for fuelling and financing conflict with
the aim of facilitating imperial domination.
In 1773, the British colonial governor in Bengal established a colonial
monopoly on the sale of opium.
As Alfred W. McCoy explained in his
masterful book,
The Politics of Heroin:
As the East India Company expanded production, opium became Indias main
export. [...] Over the next 130 years, Britain actively promoted the
export of Indian opium to China, defying Chinese drug laws and fighting two
wars to open Chinas opium market for its merchants.
Using its military and
mercantile power, Britain played a central role in making China a vast drug
market and in accelerating opium cultivation throughout China. By 1900 China
had 13.5 million addicts consuming 39,000 tons of opium.[51]
In Indochina in the 1940s and 50s, the French intelligence services enabled
the opium trade to survive government suppression efforts, and
subsequently, CIA activities in Burma helped transform the Shan states from
a relatively minor poppy-cultivating area into the largest opium-growing
region in the world. [52]
The CIA did this by supporting the Kuomintang (KMT)
army in Burma for an invasion of China, and facilitated its monopolization
and expansion of the opium trade, allowing the KMT to remain in Burma until
a coup in 1961, when they were driven into Laos and Thailand.[53]
The CIA
subsequently played a very large role in the facilitation of the drugs trade
in Laos and Vietnam throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s.[54]
It was during the 1980s that,
the CIAs covert war in Afghanistan
transformed Central Asia from a self-contained opium zone into a major
supplier of heroin for the world market, as:
Until the late 1970s, tribal farmers in the highlands of Afghanistan and
Pakistan grew limited quantities of opium and sold it to merchant caravans
bound west for Iran and east to India. In its decade of covert warfare
against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the CIAs operations provided
the political protection and logistics linkages that joined Afghanistans
poppy fields to heroin markets in Europe and America.[55]
In 1977, General Zia Ul Haq in Pakistan launched a military coup, imposed a
harsh martial-law regime, and executed former President Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto
(father to Benazir Bhutto).
When Zia came to power, the Pakistani ISI was a
minor military intelligence unit, but, under the advice and assistance of
the CIA, General Zia transformed the ISI into a powerful covert unit and
made it the strong arm of his martial-law regime. [56]
The CIA and Saudi money flowed not only to weapons and training for the
Mujahideen, but also into the drug trade.
Pakistani President Zia-ul-Haq
appointed General Fazle Haq as the military governor of Pakistans
North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), who would consult with Brzezinski on
developing an Afghan resistance program, and who became a CIA asset. When
CIA Director Casey or Vice President George H.W. Bush reviewed the CIA
Afghan operation, they went to see Haq; who by 1982, was considered by
Interpol to be an international narcotics trafficker.
Haq moved much of the
narcotics money through
the BCCI.[57]
In May of 1979, prior to the December invasion of the Soviet Union into
Afghanistan, a CIA envoy met with Afghan resistance leaders in a meeting
organized by the ISI.
The ISI offered the CIA envoy an alliance with its
own Afghan client, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who led a small guerilla group. The
CIA accepted, and over the following decade, half of the CIAs aid went to
Hekmatyars guerillas.[58]
Hekmatyar became Afghanistans leading mujahideen
drug lord, and developed a,
complex of six heroin labs in an ISI-controlled
area of Baluchistan (Pakistan). [59]
The US subsequently, through the 1980s, in conjunction with Saudi Arabia,
gave Hekmatyar more than $1 billion in armaments. Immediately, heroin began
flowing from Afghanistan to America.
By 1980, drug-related deaths in New
York City rose 77% since 1979.[60] By 1981, the drug lords in Pakistan and
Afghanistan supplied 60% of Americas heroin. Trucks going into Afghanistan
with CIA arms from Pakistan would return with heroin protected by ISI
papers from police search. [61]
Haq, the CIA asset in Pakistan, was also running the drug trade, of which
the bank BCCI was completely involved. In the 1980s, the CIA insisted that
the ISI create a special cell for the use of heroin for covert actions.
Elaborating:
This cell promoted the cultivation of opium and the extraction of heroin in
Pakistani territory as well as in the Afghan territory under Mujahideen
control for being smuggled into Soviet controlled areas in order to make the
Soviet troops heroin addicts.[62]
This plan apparently originated at the suggestion of French intelligence
chief and founder of the Safari Club, Alexandre de Marenches, who
recommended it to CIA Director Casey.[63]
In the 1980s, one program undertaken by the United States was to finance
Mujahideen propaganda in textbooks for Afghan schools.
The US gave the Mujahideen $43 million in non-lethal aid for the textbook project alone,
which was given by USAID:
The U.S. Agency for International Development, [USAID]
coordinated its work with the CIA, which ran the weapons program, and The
U.S. government told the AID to let the Afghan war chiefs decide the school
curriculum and the content of the textbooks. [64]
The textbooks were,
filled with violent images and militant Islamic
teachings, and were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of
guns, bullets, soldiers and mines.
Even since the covert war of the 1980s,
the textbooks,
have served since then as the Afghan school system's core
curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books.
The books
were developed through a USAID grant to the,
University of Nebraska-Omaha
and its Center for Afghanistan Studies, and when the books were smuggled
into Afghanistan through regional military leaders, Children were taught to
count with illustrations showing tanks, missiles and land mines.
USAID
stopped this funding in 1994.[65]
The Rise of the Taliban
When the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, the fighting continued
between the Afghan government backed by the USSR and the Mujahideen backed
by the US, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.
When the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991, so too did its aid to the Afghan government, which itself was
overthrown in 1992. However, fighting almost immediately broke out between
rival factions vying for power, including Hekmatyar.
In the early 1990s, an obscure group of Pashtun country folk had become a
powerful military and political force in Afghanistan, known as the
Taliban.[66]
The Taliban,
surfaced as a small militia force operating near
Kandahar city during the spring and summer of 1994, carrying out vigilante
attacks against minor warlords.
As growing discontent with the warlords
grew, so too did the reputation of the Taliban.[67]
The Taliban acquired an alliance with the ISI in 1994, and throughout 1995,
the relationship between the Taliban and the ISI accelerated and,
became
more and more of a direct military alliance. The Taliban ultimately became
an asset of the ISI and a client of the Pakistan army. [68]
Further,
Between 1994 and 1996, the USA supported the Taliban politically through
its allies Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, essentially because Washington viewed
the Taliban as anti-Iranian, anti-Shia, and pro-Western. [69]
Selig Harrison, a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for
Scholars and a leading US expert on South Asia, said at a conference in
India that the CIA worked with Pakistan to create the Taliban.
Harrison has
extensive contact with the CIA, as,
he had meetings with CIA leaders at
the time when Islamic forces were being strengthened in Afghanistan, while
he was a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
As he further revealed in 2001,
The CIA still has close links with the ISI.
[70]
By 1996, the Taliban had control of Kandahar, but still fighting and
instability continued in the country.
Osama and Al-Qaeda
-
Between 1980 and 1989, roughly $600 million was passed through Osama bin
Ladens charity front organizations, specifically the Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK),
also known as Al-Kifah.
The money mostly originated with wealthy donors in
Saudi Arabia and other areas in the Persian Gulf, and was funneled through
his charity fronts to arm and fund the mujahideen in Afghanistan.[71]
-
In the 1980s, the British Special Forces (SAS) were training mujahideen in
Afghanistan, as well as in secret camps in Scotland, and the SAS is largely
taking orders from the CIA. The CIA also indirectly begins to arm Osama bin
Laden.[72]
Osama bin Ladens front charity, the MAK, was nurtured by the
Pakistani ISI.[73]
Osama bin Laden was reported to have been personally recruited by the CIA in
1979 in Istanbul. He had the close support of Prince Turki bin Faisal, his
friend and head of Saudi intelligence, and also developed ties with
Hekmatyar in Afghanistan,[74] both of whom were pivotal figures in the
CIA-Safari Club network.
General Akhtar Abdul Rahman, the head of the
Pakistani ISI from 1980 to 1987, would meet regularly with Osama bin Laden
in Pakistan, and they formed a partnership in demanding a tax on the opium
trade from warlords so that by 1985, bin Laden and the ISI were splitting
the profits of over $100 million per year.[75]
-
In 1985, Osama bin Ladens
brother, Salem, stated that Osama was the liaison between the US, the Saudi
government, and the Afghan rebels. [76]
-
In 1988, Bin Laden discussed the establishment of a new military group,
which would come to be known as Al-Qaeda.[77]
Osama bin Ladens charity
front, the MAK, (eventually to form Al-Qaeda) founded the al-Kifah Center in
Brooklyn, New York, to recruit Muslims for the jihad against the Soviets.
The al-Kifah Center was founded in the late 1980s with the support of the
U.S. government, which provided visas for known terrorists associated with
the organization, including Ali Mohamed, the blind sheik Omar Abdel Rahman
and possibly the lead 9/11 hijacker, Mohamed Atta.[78]
This coincided with the creation of Al-Qaeda, of which the al-Kifah Center
was a recruiting front. Foot soldiers for Al-Qaeda were admitted to the
United States for training under a special visa program. The FBI had been
surveilling the training of terrorists, however, it terminated this
surveillance in the fall of 1989.
-
In 1990, the CIA granted Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman a visa to come run the al-Kifah Center, who was considered an
untouchable as he was being protected by no fewer than three agencies,
including the State Department, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the
CIA.[79]
Robin Cook, a former British MP and Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote that
Al-Qaeda,
literally the database, was originally the computer file of the
thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the
CIA to defeat the Russians. [80]
Thus, Al-Qaeda was born as an instrument
of western intelligence agencies.
This account of al-Qaeda was further
corroborated by a former French military intelligence agent, who stated
that, In the mid-1980s, Al Qaida was a database, and that it remained as
such into the 1990s.
He contended that,
Al Qaida was neither a terrorist
group nor Osama bin Laden's personal property, and further:
The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al Qaida.
And any informed intelligence officer knows this. But there is a propaganda
campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an identified entity
representing the 'devil' only in order to drive the 'TV watcher' to accept a
unified international leadership for a war against terrorism.
The country
behind this propaganda is the US and the lobbyists for the US war on
terrorism are only interested in making money.[81]
The creation of Al-Qaeda was thus facilitated by the CIA and allied
intelligence networks, the purpose of which was to maintain this database
of Mujahideen to be used as intelligence assets to achieve US foreign policy
objectives, throughout both the Cold War, and into the post-Cold War era of
the new world order.

Part II
Empire, Energy and Al-Qaeda - The Anglo-American Terror Network
September 8, 2010
The End of the Cold War and Strategy for the New World Order
With the end of the Cold War a new strategy had to be determined to manage
the global system.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, declarations of a
New World Order sprang forward, focusing on the United States as the
single world superpower. This presented a great many challenges as well as
opportunities for the worlds most powerful hegemon.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, a number of new Central Asian and
Eastern European nations were formed and became independent, and with that,
their immense deposits of natural gas and energy became available for
exploitation.
Afghanistan itself was considered,
a major strategic pivot,
as it was the primary gateway to Central Asia and the immense energy
deposits therein.[1]
Western oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Texaco,
Unocal, BP Amoco, Shell, and Enron begin pouring billions of dollars into
the countries of Central Asia in the early 1990s.[2]
In 1992, a Pentagon document titled Defense Planning Guidance was leaked
to the press, in which it described a strategy for the United States in the
new world order, and it was drafted by George H.W. Bushs Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney.
It stated that,
Americas political and military
mission in the post-cold-war era will be to ensure that no rival superpower
is allowed to emerge in Western Europe, Asia or the territories of the
former Soviet Union, and that, The classified document makes the case for
a world dominated by one superpower whose position can be perpetuated by
constructive behavior and sufficient military might to deter any nation or
group of nations from challenging American primacy.[3]
Further,
the new draft sketches a world in which there is one dominant
military power whose leaders must maintain the mechanisms for deterring
potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global
role.
Among the necessary challenges to American supremacy, the document
postulated regional wars against Iraq and North Korea, and identified
China and Russia as its major threats.
It further,
suggests that the United
States could also consider extending to Eastern and Central European nations
security commitments similar to those extended to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
other Arab states along the Persian Gulf.[4]
Similarly, in 1992, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, one of
the most influential think tanks in the United States, had established a
commission to determine a new foreign policy for the United States in the
wake of the Cold War.
Participants included,
-
Madeleine Albright
-
Henry
Cisneros
-
John Deutch
-
Richard Holbrooke
-
Alice Rivlin
-
David Gergen
-
Admiral William Crowe
In the summer of 1992, the final report, Changing
Our Ways: America and the New World, was published.
The report urged,
a new
principle of international relations: the destruction or displacement of
groups of people within states can justify international intervention.
It
suggested that the US,
realign NATO and OSCE [Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe] to deal with new security problems in Europe, and
urged military intervention under humanitarian guises.
This report
subsequently,
planted the policy seedlings for the Kosovo war as it
provided both the rationale for U.S. interventionism and a policy
recommendation about the best means - NATO - for waging that war.[5]
Another Carnegie publication in the same year,
Self-Determination in the
New World Order, furthered imperialist goals for America, as it set
criteria for officials to use in deciding when to support separatist ethnic
groups seeking independence, and advocated military force for that purpose.
It recommended that,
international military coalitions, preferably U.N.-led,
could send armed force not as peacekeepers but peacemakers - to prevent
conflict from breaking out and stay in place indefinitely.
It further
stated that,
the use of military force to create a new state would require
conduct by the parent government so egregious that it has forfeited any
right to govern the minority claiming self-determination.[6]
The United States and its NATO allies soon undertook a new strategy, seeking
to maintain dominance over the world, expand their hegemony over regions
previously under the influence of the Soviet Union (such as in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia), and prevent the rise of a resurgent Russia or
China.
One of the key facets of this strategy was the notion of
humanitarian intervention.
Yugoslavia Dismantled by Design
In the 1990s, the United States and its NATO allies, in particular Germany
and the UK, undertook a strategy of destabilization in Yugoslavia, seeking
to dismantle and ultimately fracture the country.
To do this, the imperial
strategy of divide and conquer was employed, manipulating various ethnic
tensions and arming and training various militias and terrorist
organizations. Throughout this strategy, the database, or Al-Qaeda was
used to promote the agenda of the destabilization and dismantling of
Yugoslavia.
In 1989, Yugoslavia had to seek financial aid from the
World Bank and
IMF,
which implemented a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), which resulted in
the dismantling of the public state, exacerbating social issues and fueling
secessionist tendencies, leading to Croatia and Slovenia seceding from the
republic in 1991.[7] In 1990, the US intelligence community had released a
report predicting that Yugoslavia would break apart and erupt in civil war,
and it blamed Milosevic for the impending disaster.[8]
As far back as 1988, the leader of Croatia met with the German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl to create a joint policy to break up Yugoslavia, and bring
Slovenia and Croatia into the German economic zone. So, US Army officers
were dispatched to Croatia, Bosnia, Albania, and Macedonia as advisers and
brought in US Special Forces to help.[9]
Fighting broke out between Yugoslavia and Croatia when the latter declared
independence in 1991. The fighting subsequently lasted until 1995, and
merged in part with the Bosnian war. The US supported the operation and the
CIA actively provided intelligence to Croat forces, leading to the
displacement of between 150,000 and 200,000 Serbs, largely through means of
murder, plundering, burning villages and ethnic cleansing.[10]
The Croatian
Army was trained by U.S. advisers and a general later put on trial at the
Hague for war crimes was personally supported by the CIA.[11]
So we see the
double standard of ethnic cleansing and genocide: when the US does it or
supports it, its humanitarian intervention, politically justified, or it
is simply unacknowledged; when an enemy state does it, (or is accused of
doing it), the international community demands action and any means is
deemed necessary to prevent genocide, including committing genocide.
The Clinton administration gave the green light to Iran to arm the Bosnian
Muslims and from 1992 to January 1996, there was an influx of Iranian
weapons and advisers into Bosnia.
Further,
Iran, and other Muslim states,
helped to bring Mujahideen fighters into Bosnia to fight with the Muslims
against the Serbs, 'holy warriors' from Afghanistan, Chechnya, Yemen and
Algeria, some of whom had suspected links with Osama bin Laden's training
camps in Afghanistan.[12]
During the war in Bosnia, there,
was a vast secret conduit of weapons
smuggling though Croatia. This was arranged by the clandestine agencies of
the US, Turkey and Iran, together with a range of radical Islamist groups,
including Afghan mojahedin and the pro-Iranian Hizbullah.
Further, the
secret services of Ukraine, Greece and Israel were busy arming the Bosnian
Serbs.[13]
Germanys intelligence agency, the BND, also ran arms shipments
to the Bosnian Muslims and Croatia to fight against the Serbs.[14]
Thus,
every side was being funded and armed by outside powers seeking to foment
conflict and ultimately break up Yugoslavia to serve their own imperial
objectives in the region.
-
In 1992, the al-Kifah Center in Brooklyn, the recruiting center for
al-Qaeda, made Bosnia its chief target. By 1993, it opened a branch in
Croatia. The recruitment operation for Bosnian Muslims was a covert action
project sponsored not only by Saudi Arabia but also in part by the US
government.[15]
-
In 1996, the Albanian Mafia, in collaboration with the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), a militant guerilla organization, took control over the enormous
Balkan heroin trafficking routes. The KLA was linked to former Afghan
Mujaheddin fighters in Afghanistan, including Osama bin Laden.[16]
-
In 1997, the KLA began fighting against Serbian forces,[17] and in 1998, the
US State Department removed the KLA from its list of terrorist
organizations.[18] Before and after 1998, the KLA was receiving arms,
training and support from the US and NATO, and Clintons Secretary of State,
Madeline Albright, was close with KLA leader Hashim Thaci.[19]
Both the CIA and German intelligence, the BND, supported the KLA terrorists
in Yugoslavia prior to and after the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The
BND had KLA contacts since the early 1990s, the same period that the KLA was
establishing its Al-Qaeda contacts.[20]
KLA members were trained by Osama
bin Laden at training camps in Afghanistan. Even the UN stated that much of
the violence at the time came from KLA members,
especially those allied
with Hashim Thaci.[21]
The March 1999 NATO bombing of Kosovo was justified on the pretense of
putting an end to Serbian oppression of Kosovo Albanians, which was termed
genocide.
The Clinton Administration made claims that at least 100,000
Kosovo Albanians were missing and may have been killed by the Serbs. Bill
Clinton personally compared events in Kosovo to the Holocaust. The US State
Department had stated that up to 500,000 Albanians were feared dead.
Eventually, the official estimate was reduced to 10,000, however, after
exhaustive investigations, it was revealed that the death of less than 2,500
Albanians could be attributed to the Serbs. During the NATO bombing
campaign, between 400 and 1,500 Serb civilians were killed, and NATO
committed war crimes, including the bombing of a Serb TV station and a
hospital.[22]
Ultimately the strategy of the destabilization of Yugoslavia served various
imperial objectives. The war in Yugoslavia was waged in order to enlarge
NATO, Serbia was to be excluded permanently from European development to
justify a US military presence in the region, and expansion was ultimately
designed to contain Russia.[23]
An op-ed in the New York Times in 1996 stated that,
instead of seeing
Bosnia as the eastern frontier of NATO, we should view the Balkans as the
western frontier of America's rapidly expanding sphere of influence in the
Middle East.
Further:
The fact that the United States is more enthusiastic than its European
allies about a Bosnian Muslim state reflects, among other things, the new
American role as the leader of an informal collection of Muslim nations from
the Persian Gulf to the Balkans. The regions once ruled by the Ottoman Turks
show signs of becoming the heart of a third American empire.
[...] Now, in the years after the cold war, the United States is again
establishing suzerainty over the empire of a former foe. The disintegration
of the Soviet Union has prompted the United States to expand its zone of
military hegemony into Eastern Europe (through NATO) and into formerly
neutral Yugoslavia. And - most important of all - the end of the cold war
has permitted America to deepen its involvement the Middle East.[24]
Further, with the dismantling of the former Yugoslavia, a passageway for the
transport of oil and natural gas from the Caspian region was to be
facilitated through the construction of the Trans-Balkan pipeline, which
will,
run from the Black sea port of Burgas to the Adriatic at Vlore,
passing through Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania. It is likely to become the
main route to the west for the oil and gas now being extracted in central
Asia. It will carry 750,000 barrels a day: a throughput, at current prices,
of some $600m a month.
As the Guardian reported:
The project is necessary, according to a paper published by the US Trade and
Development Agency last May, because the oil coming from the Caspian Sea
"will quickly surpass the safe capacity of the Bosphorus as a shipping
lane".
The scheme, the agency notes, will "provide a consistent source of
crude oil to American refineries", "provide American companies with a key
role in developing the vital east-west corridor", "advance the
privatization
aspirations of the US government in the region" and "facilitate rapid
integration" of the Balkans "with western Europe".
In November 1998, Bill Richardson, then US energy secretary, spelt out his
policy on the extraction and transport of Caspian oil.
"This is about
America's energy security," he explained. "It's also about preventing
strategic inroads by those who don't share our values. We're trying to move
these newly independent countries toward the west.
"We would like to see them reliant on western commercial and political
interests rather than going another way. We've made a substantial political
investment in the Caspian, and it's very important to us that both the
pipeline map and the politics come out right."[25]
The pipeline project, supported since 1994,
featured prominently in Balkan
war politics. On December 9 1998, the Albanian president attended a meeting
about the scheme in Sofia, and linked it inextricably to Kosovo.
The
message given at the meeting was that,
if you [the United States] want
Albanian consent for the Trans-Balkan pipeline, you had better wrest Kosovo
out of the hands of the Serbs.[26]
And so, with the help of an international network of CIA-trained Islamic
militants, American political and economic hegemony expanded into Central
Asia and the Caspian region.
The Spread of Al-Qaeda
Al-Qaeda did not just spread to Bosnia and Albania/Kosovo, but rather a
great many places around the world saw the spread of this vast database of
Islamist fighters, and always aided by Western intelligence agencies or
their regional conduits (such as the ISI and Saudi intelligence agencies).
Following on the heels of the established American and NATO strategy
following the Cold War, Islamic fundamentalism also came to play a part in
this strategy.
Bernard Lewis was a former British intelligence officer and historian who is
infamous for explaining Arab discontent towards the West as not being rooted
in a reaction toward imperialism, but rather that it is rooted in Islam; in
that Islam is incompatible with the West, and that they are destined to
clash, using the term, Clash of Civilizations.
For decades,
Lewis played
a critical role as professor, mentor, and guru to two generations of Orientalists, academics, U.S. and British intelligence specialists, think
tank denizens, and assorted neoconservatives.
In the 1980s, Lewis,
was
hobnobbing with top Department of Defense officials.[27]
He was also one of
the originators, along with Brzezinski, of the Arc of Crisis strategy
employed in the late 1970s.
Lewis wrote a 1992 article in Foreign Affairs, the journal of the Council on
Foreign Relations, titled, Rethinking the Middle East.
In this article,
Lewis raised the prospect of another policy towards the Middle East in the
wake of the end of the Cold War and beginnings of the New World Order,
which could even be precipitated by fundamentalism, is what has of late
become fashionable to call 'Lebanonization.' Most of the states of the
Middle East - Egypt is an obvious exception - are of recent and artificial
construction and are vulnerable to such a process.
If the central power is
sufficiently weakened, there is no real civil society to hold the polity
together, no real sense of common national identity or overriding allegiance
to the nation-state. The state then disintegrates - as happened in Lebanon -
into a chaos of squabbling, feuding, fighting sects, tribes, regions and
parties.[28]
Thus, the database of Al-Qaeda could be spread internationally so as to
destabilize various regions, and thus provide the justification for
intervention or even war.
All that was needed was well-placed intelligence
operatives to control key leadership positions within the terrorist
organization. The great majority of both its higher-ups and nearly all
al-Qaeda operatives would not have to be made aware of the organizations
covert use as an arm of US geo-policy.
In the 1990s,
Osama bin Laden,
built a shadow air force to support his
terrorist activities, using Afghanistan's national airline, a surplus U.S.
Air Force jet and clandestine charters.
Further, as the Los Angeles Times
revealed:
With the Taliban's blessing, Bin Laden effectively had hijacked Ariana, the
national civilian airline of Afghanistan. For four years, according to
former U.S. aides and exiled Afghan officials, Ariana's passenger and
charter flights ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash and opium through the
United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.
Members of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network were provided false Ariana identification that gave them free run of
airports in the Middle East.
[...] Taliban authorities also opened the country's airstrips to
high-ranking Persian Gulf state officials who routinely flew in for lavish
hunting parties. Sometimes joined by Bin Laden and Taliban leaders, the
dignitaries, who included several high-ranking officials from Saudi Arabia
and the Emirates - left behind money, vehicles and equipment with their
hosts, according to U.S. and Afghan accounts.[29]
Bin Ladens secret purchase of a US Air Force jet in 1992,
was used to ferry
Al Qaeda commanders to East Africa, where they trained Somali tribesmen for
attacks on U.S. peacekeeping forces, and Americans had unwittingly helped
bin Laden disguise the plane as a civilian jet. US security officials were
well aware of Ariana airlines being used by al-Qaeda.[30]
Among the high-ranking Persian Gulf officials who flew to Afghanistan for
hunting trips were Prince Turki al Faisal who ran Saudi intelligence until
August 2001, maintaining close ties with Bin Laden and the Taliban, as
well as Sheik Mohammed ibn Rashid al Maktum, the Dubai crown prince and
Emirates defense minister.
On occasions both Osama bin Laden and Omar, the
head of the Taliban, mingled with the hunters.
Upon their departure,
the
wealthy visitors often left behind late-model jeeps, trucks and supplies,
which was one way the Taliban got their equipment.[31]
What the article does not mention, however, was that the ISI was the prime
sponsor of the Taliban, with the complete backing and facilitation of the
CIA.
The connection to the Saudi intelligence chief further strengthens the
thesis that the Safari Club, created in 1976 by the French intelligence
chief, may have survived as a covert intelligence network encompassing
western intelligence agencies working through regional agencies such as
those of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
The German intelligence agency, the BND, revealed in 2004 that two Saudi
companies that were linked with financing al-Qaeda throughout the 1990s were
in fact front organizations for Saudi intelligence, with close connections
to its chief, Prince Turki bin Faisal.[32]
Between 1989 and 2001, Billy Waugh, a CIA contractor, trained several
al-Qaeda operatives around the world.[33]
In 2002, it was revealed that,
British intelligence paid large sums of money to an al-Qaeda cell in Libya
in a doomed attempt to assassinate Colonel Gadaffi in 1996 and thwarted
early attempts to bring Osama bin Laden to justice.
In 1998, Libya had
issued an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden, yet:
British and US intelligence agencies buried the fact that the arrest warrant
had come from Libya and played down the threat. Five months after the
warrant was issued, al-Qaeda killed more than 200 people in the truck
bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.[34]
However,
the resistance of Western intelligence agencies to the Libyan
concerns can be explained by MI6's involvement with the al-Qaeda coup plot.
Anas al-Liby, a Libyan al-Qaeda leader,
was given political asylum in
Britain and lived in Manchester until May of 2000 when he eluded a police
raid on his house and fled abroad.[35]
Following the end of the Cold War, many mujahideen fighters were relocated
to Russias unstable region of Chechnya, where the two main rebel leaders
who came to power had previously been trained and funded by the CIA in
Afghanistan.
The war in Chechnya was planned in a secret meeting in 1996
attended by Osama bin Laden and high-ranking officials of the Pakistani ISI,
whose involvement in Chechnya went,
far beyond supplying the Chechens with
weapons and expertise: the ISI and its radical Islamic proxies are actually
calling the shots in this war.[36]
In other words, the CIA was directing
the war through the ISI.
The US and U.K. have supported Chechen separatism as it,
weakens Russia,
advances U.S. power in the vital Caspian Sea region, and cripples a
potential future rival.[37]
Mikhail Gorbachev, former President of Russia,
claimed that the British had been arming the Chechen rebels.[38]
Oil also
features prominently in the Chechen conflict, as Chechnya is home to large
reserves of oil, as well as pipeline corridor routes being competed over by
Russian and Anglo-American oil conglomerates. Thus, the Anglo-Americans
support the Chechen separatists, while the Russians send in the
military.[39]
US intelligence helped fund and transport al-Qaeda into
Chechnya in the early 1990s, American intelligence remained involved until
the end of the decade, seeing the,
sponsorship of Islamist jihad in the
Caucasus as a way to deprive Russia of a viable pipeline route through
spiraling violence and terrorism.[40]
The Global Domination Strategy for a New Century
Following upon the strategic objectives set out in the early 1990s for the
United States and NATO to expand their hegemony across the world, in
preventing the rise of rivals (China and Russia), and expanding the access
of western economic interests to the Caspian region, new designs were being
drawn in the powerful think-tank community in the United States as well as
being outlined by highly influential strategic thinkers.
The renewed
strategy, hardly a break from the previously determined aim of encirclement
and containment of China and Russia, simply expanded the scope of this
strategy.
From one faction, the neo-conservatives, came the initial aim at
expanding militarily into the Middle East, starting with Iraq, while the
more established hard-line realist hawks such as Zbigniew Brzezinski
outlined a far more comprehensive and long-term strategy of world domination
by controlling the entirety of Eurasia (Europe and Asia), and subsequently,
Africa.
The neo-Conservative hawks in the US foreign policy establishment formed the
think tank, the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) in the 1990s. In
2000, they published their report, Rebuilding Americas Defenses, in which
they outlined a strategy for the United States in the new century.
Following where the Defense Planning Guidance document left off (during the
first Bush administration), the report stated that,
the United States must
retain sufficient forces able to rapidly deploy and win multiple
simultaneous large-scale wars, and that there is a, need to retain
sufficient combat forces to fight and win, multiple, nearly simultaneous
major theatre wars, as the Pentagon needs to begin to calculate the force
necessary to protect, independently, US interests in Europe, East Asia and
the Gulf at all times.[41]
It recommended the regime change of Saddam Hussein in Iraq as the
immediate justification for a US military presence in the Gulf; however,
the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends
the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.
In advocating for a massive
increase in defense spending, and outlining military operations against
Iraq, North Korea, and possibly Iran, the report stated that,
further, the
process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely
to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new
Pearl Harbor.[42]
Zbigniew Brzezinski outlined a long-term American imperial strategy to
control Eurasia in his book,
The Grand Chessboard.
He stated bluntly that,
it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges, capable of dominating
Eurasia and thus of also challenging America,
...and then made clear the
imperial nature of his strategy:
To put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of
ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to
prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to
keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from
coming together.[43]
He further explained that the Central Asian nations (or Eurasian Balkans
as he refers to them):
are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions
to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors,
namely Russia, Turkey and Iran, with China also signaling an increasing
political interest in the region. But the Eurasian Balkans are infinitely
more important as a potential economic prize: an enormous concentration of
natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region, in addition to
important minerals, including gold.[44]
Brzezinski emphasizes,
that America's primary interest is to help ensure
that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the
global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it.[45]
Preparing for War Against Afghanistan
In 1997, Taliban officials traveled to Texas to meet with Unocal Oil Company
to discuss the possibility of a pipeline being built from Turkmenistan
across Afghanistan and to Pakistan.
Unocal had agreements with Turkmenistan
to sell its gas and with Pakistan to buy it. The missing link was getting
the gas to Pakistan through Afghanistan, which is where the Taliban came
into the picture. Unocals main competitor in the pipeline bid was with Bridas, an Argentine firm. However, at this time, Afghanistan was still
embroiled in civil war, making the prospect of a pipeline being built an
unstable venture.[46]
A month before the Taliban visited Texas, Bridas, Unocals main competitor,
merged its oil and gas assets with Amoco-Argentina Oil, a subsidiary of
British Petroleum (BP), one of the worlds top three oil companies.[47]
Shortly before this merger was finalized, Bridas had announced that it was
close to signing a 2 billion dollar deal with the Taliban, saying,
the talks
were in their final stages.[48]
After meeting with Unocal officials in Texas, the Taliban announced in
January of 1998 that,
they're close to reaching a final agreement on the
building of a gas pipeline across Afghanistan, however, they didn't
indicate which of two competing companies the Taliban favored.[49]
It is significant to note some of the important figures that were involved
with the oil companies in relation to Central Asian gas reserves and
pipeline projects.
In 1997, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the (self-proclaimed)
mastermind for the Afghan-Soviet War, Jimmy Carters National Security
Adviser, and cofounder with David Rockefeller of
the Trilateral Commission,
was an adviser to BP-Amoco, specifically dealing with the Caspian
region.[50]
Unocal, in an effort to try to secure their pipeline contract
with the Taliban, hired former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Afghan-born Zalmay Khalilzad, former Reagan State Department Advisor on
Afghanistan during the Afghan-Soviet War, was also brought on as a
consultant for a group hired by Unocal. He would later become US envoy to
Afghanistan after the US invasion in 2001.[51]
The pipeline project then ran into significant problems when, in December of
1998, Unocal announced that it quit its Afghan pipeline project.[52] Between
1996 and 2001, Enron bosses had given millions of dollars in bribes to
Taliban officials to secure contracts for building pipelines. After Unocal
withdrew from the deal, Enron continued to pressure the Taliban to continue
with a pipeline.
In 1996, neighboring Uzbekistan signed a deal with Enron to
develop Uzbek natural gas fields.[53] In 1997, Halliburton, with Dick Cheney
as its CEO, secured a contract in Turkmenistan for exploration and drilling
in the Caspian Sea basin.[54]
However, in December of 2001, Enron filed for
bankruptcy.
Eventually, Unocal pulled out of the deal as a result of Afghanistans
Taliban government not being fully recognized internationally as the
legitimate Afghan government, and therefore, the pipeline project could not
receive funding from international financial institutions like the World
Bank. Unocal also pulled out as a result of the continual conflict raging in
Afghanistan between various groups.[55]
In 1999, the Pentagon issued a secret document confirmed by the Joint Chiefs
of Staff and Secretary of Defense, which stated that,
Oil conflicts over
production facilities and transport routes, particularly in the Persian Gulf
and Caspian regions, are specifically envisaged in the near future, stating
that, energy and resource issues will continue to shape international
security.
The document,
vividly highlights how the highest levels of the US Defence community accepted the waging of an oil war as a legitimate military
option.[56]
Before
George W. Bush became President in January of 2001, there were plans
at the highest levels of the United States government in beginning
preparations for a war against Afghanistan, which included attempts to
secure an alliance with the Russians in calling for military action against
Afghanistan.[57]
In March of 2001 it was reported that India has joined the US, Russia and
Iran in an effort to militarily replace the Afghan Taliban government, with
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to be used as bases to launch incursions into
Afghanistan against the Taliban.[58]
In the Spring of 2001, the US military
envisaged and war gamed the entire scenario of a US attack on Afghanistan,
which subsequently became the operational plan for the war.[59]
In the summer of 2001, the Taliban were leaked information from top-secret
meetings that the Bush regime was planning to launch a military operation
against the Taliban in July to replace the government. A US military
contingency plan existed on paper to attack Afghanistan from the north by
the end of the summer of 2001, as in, prior to 9/11.[60]
A former Pakistani diplomat told the BBC that the US was planning military
action against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban before the 9/11 attacks.
Niaz
Naik, former Pakistani Foreign Secretary,
was told by senior American
officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go
ahead by the middle of October.
The invasion subsequently took place on
October 7, 2001. Naik was told of this information at a secretive
UN-sponsored meeting which took place in Berlin in July 2001, with officials
from the US, Russia, and many Central Asian countries.
He also stated that
the US would launch the operation from their bases in Tajikistan,
where
American advisers were already in place.[61]
As revealed by MSNBC,
President Bush was expected to sign detailed plans
for a worldwide war against al-Qaida two days before Sept. 11, and that,
The plan dealt with all aspects of a war against al-Qaida, ranging from
diplomatic initiatives to military operations in Afghanistan.
It outlined
essentially the same war plan as was put into action following the 9/11
attacks.
The National Security document was also submitted to Condoleezza
Rice prior to the attacks, and included plans to attack the Taliban and
remove them from power in Afghanistan.[62]
Former British Prime Minister
Tony Blair stated that,
To be truthful about it, there was no way we could
have got the public consent to have suddenly launched a campaign on
Afghanistan but for what happened on September 11.[63]
Following the start of the war on Afghanistan in October of 2001, the
Guardians George Monbiot wrote that the war,
may also be a late colonial
adventure, as Afghanistan is as indispensable to the regional control and
transport of oil in central Asia as Egypt was in the Middle East.
It is
worth quoting Monbiot at some length:
Afghanistan has some oil and gas of its own, but not enough to qualify as a
major strategic concern. Its northern neighbors, by contrast, contain
reserves which could be critical to future global supply. In 1998, Dick
Cheney, now US vice-president but then chief executive of a major oil
services company, remarked: "I cannot think of a time when we have had a
region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the
Caspian." But the oil and gas there is worthless until it is moved.
The only
route which makes both political and economic sense is through Afghanistan.
Transporting all the Caspian basin's fossil fuel through Russia or
Azerbaijan would greatly enhance Russia's political and economic control
over the central Asian republics, which is precisely what the west has spent
10 years trying to prevent. Piping it through Iran would enrich a regime
which the US has been seeking to isolate.
Sending it the long way round
through China, quite aside from the strategic considerations, would be
prohibitively expensive.
But pipelines through Afghanistan would allow the
US both to pursue its aim of "diversifying energy supply" and to penetrate
the world's most lucrative markets. Growth in European oil consumption is
slow and competition is intense. In south Asia, by contrast, demand is
booming and competitors are scarce. Pumping oil south and selling it in
Pakistan and India, in other words, is far more profitable than pumping it
west and selling it in Europe.
As the author Ahmed Rashid has documented, in 1995 the US oil company Unocal
started negotiating to build oil and gas pipelines from Turkmenistan,
through Afghanistan and into Pakistani ports on the Arabian sea. The
company's scheme required a single administration in Afghanistan, which
would guarantee safe passage for its goods.
Soon after the Taliban took
Kabul in September 1996, the Telegraph reported that,
"oil industry insiders
say the dream of securing a pipeline across Afghanistan is the main reason
why Pakistan, a close political ally of America's, has been so supportive of
the Taliban, and why America has quietly acquiesced in its conquest of
Afghanistan".
Unocal invited some of the leaders of the Taliban to Houston,
where they were royally entertained. The company suggested paying these
barbarians 15 cents for every thousand cubic feet of gas it pumped through
the land they had conquered.
For the first year of Taliban rule, US policy towards the regime appears to
have been determined principally by Unocal's interests.
In 1997 a US
diplomat told Rashid,
"the Taliban will probably develop like the Saudis did.
There will be Aramco [the former US oil consortium in Saudi Arabia]
pipelines, an emir, no parliament and lots of Sharia law. We can live with
that."
[...] In February 1998, John Maresca, [Unocals] head of international
relations, told representatives that the growth in demand for energy in Asia
and sanctions against Iran determined that Afghanistan remained "the only
other possible route" for Caspian oil. The company, once the Afghan
government was recognized by foreign diplomats and banks, still hoped to
build a 1,000-mile pipeline, which would carry a million barrels a day. Only
in December 1998, four months after the embassy bombings in east Africa, did
Unocal drop its plans.
But Afghanistan's strategic importance has not changed.
In September, a few
days before the attack on New York, the US energy information administration
reported that,
"Afghanistan's significance from an energy standpoint stems
from its geographical position as a potential transit route for oil and
natural gas exports from central Asia to the Arabian sea. This potential
includes the possible construction of oil and natural gas export pipelines
through Afghanistan".
Given that the US government is dominated by former
oil industry executives, we would be foolish to suppose that such plans no
longer figure in its strategic thinking.
As the researcher Keith Fisher has
pointed out, the possible economic outcomes of the war in Afghanistan mirror
the possible economic outcomes of the war in the Balkans, where the
development of "Corridor 8", an economic zone built around a pipeline
carrying oil and gas from the Caspian to Europe, is a critical allied
concern.
American foreign policy is governed by the doctrine of "full-spectrum
dominance", which means that the US should control military, economic and
political development worldwide.
China has responded by seeking to expand
its interests in central Asia. The defense white paper Beijing published
last year argued that,
"China's fundamental interests lie in... the
establishment and maintenance of a new regional security order".
In June,
China and Russia pulled four central Asian republics into a "Shanghai
cooperation organization".
Its purpose, according to Jiang Zemin, is to,
"foster world multi-polarization", by which he means contesting US
full-spectrum dominance.
If the US succeeds in overthrowing the Taliban and replacing them with a
stable and grateful pro-western government and if the US then binds the
economies of central Asia to that of its ally Pakistan, it will have crushed
not only terrorism, but also the growing ambitions of both Russia and China.
Afghanistan, as ever, is the key to the western domination of Asia.[64]
As revealed by the San Francisco Chronicle in November of 2001,
the United
States and Pakistan decided to install a stable regime in place in
Afghanistan around 1994 - a regime that would end the country's civil war
and thus ensure the safety of the Unocal pipeline project.
And so:
the State Department and Pakistan's Inter- Services Intelligence agency
agreed to funnel arms and funding to the Taliban in their war against the
ethnically Tajik Northern Alliance. As recently as 1999, U.S. taxpayers paid
the entire annual salary of every single Taliban government official, all in
the hopes of returning to the days of dollar-a- gallon gas. Pakistan,
naturally, would pick up revenues from a Karachi oil port facility.[65]
Clearly, the plans and purposes for war on Afghanistan had been well
established.
What was needed was the public justification. The people will
not readily support a war to dominate strategic energy reserves and pipeline
routes halfway around the world. Besides the fact that this would be an
admission of empire, something that still a great many in the American
public have failed to reconcile and accept, it would be a difficult task to
ask Americans to die for Unocal.
What the American people needed to rouse
their appetite for war was to have their collective consciousness reshaped
by fear; what was needed was terror.

9/11 ANALYSIS - 9/11 and Americas Secret Terror Campaign
September 10, 2010
Anticipating An Attack
For several years prior to the events of 9/11, top American strategists had
been acknowledging the necessity of what they oft-termed a new Pearl
Harbor, a momentous attack upon America itself, in order to mobilize the
American populace for a new global war of domination.
As
Zbigniew Brzezinski
wrote in his 1997 book
The Grand Chessboard,
America's primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to
control this geopolitical space [of Central Asia] and that the global
community has unhindered financial and economic access to it.[1]
Brzezinski
acknowledged in his book that,
the pursuit of power is not a goal that
commands popular passion, except in conditions of a sudden threat or
challenge to the publics sense of domestic well-being.[2]
He also wrote
that,
The public supported Americas engagement in World War II largely
because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.[3]
In 1999, Andrew Krepinevich, Executive Director of the Center for Strategic
and Budgetary Assessments testified before the Senate Armed Services
Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.
He stated that the US
faces an unprecedented challenge:
[T]he need to transform our armed forces into a very different kind of
military from that which exists today, while sustaining the militarys
ability to play a very active role in supporting U.S. near-term efforts to
preserve global stability within a national security strategy of engagement
and enlargement.[4]
After advocating a massive re-imagining of the role and nature of US
military might, pushing the notion of a revolution in military affairs and
an acceleration of imperial ambitions, he told the Senate Committee:
There appears to be general agreement concerning the need to transform the
U.S. military into a significantly different kind of force from that which
emerged victorious from the Cold and Gulf Wars. Yet this verbal support has
not been translated into a defense program supporting transformation.
[...] While there is growing support in Congress for transformation, the
critical mass [i.e., public support] needed to effect it has not yet been
achieved. One may conclude that, in the absence of a strong external shock
to the United States - a latter-day Pearl Harbor of sorts - surmounting the
barriers to transformation will likely prove a long, arduous process.[5]
In 1999, Graham Fuller, former Deputy Director of the CIAs National Council
on Intelligence, advocated using Muslim forces to further US interests in
Central Asia.
He stated that,
The policy of guiding the evolution of Islam
and of helping them against our adversaries worked marvelously well in
Afghanistan against [the Russians]. The same doctrines can still be used to
destabilize what remains of Russian power, and especially to counter the
Chinese influence in Central Asia.[6]
In June of 2000, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Pentagon released Joint
Vision 2020, outlining the American military strategy that the Department of
Defense will follow in the future.
The emphasis in the report was put on
the notion of Full Spectrum Dominance, which means,
the ability of U.S.
forces, operating alone or with allies, to defeat any adversary and control
any situation across the range of military operations:
Joint Vision 2020 addresses full-spectrum dominance across the range of
conflicts from nuclear war to major theater wars to smaller-scale
contingencies. It also addresses amorphous situations like peacekeeping and
noncombat humanitarian relief.[7]
The neoconservative think tank the Project for the New American Century (PNAC)
released a report in September of 2000 called Rebuilding Americas Defenses
in which they advocated for a massive expansion of Americas empire and
full spectrum dominance as well as the necessity to undertake a
Revolution in military affairs, and undertake multiple simultaneous wars
in different regions of the world.
Several members of the think tank and
authors of the report would go on to enter key policy positions within the
Bush administration several months later (including, but not limited to Dick
Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Zalmay Khalilzad). While
acknowledging the massive undertaking this project would be, the report
stated:
Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary
change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing
event - like a new Pearl Harbor.[8]
In January of 2001, the Rumsfeld Commission, which was set up to analyze the
US National Security Space Management and Organization, chaired by incoming
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld (who had also been a signatory to
and member of the Project for the New American Century at the same time).
It
advocated an expansion of military capabilities in Space and a total
reorganization of the armed forces and intelligence agencies of the United
States.
The report stated that:
History is replete with instances in which warning signs were ignored and
change resisted until an external, improbable event forced resistant
bureaucracies to take action. The question is whether the US will be wise
enough to act responsibly and soon enough to reduce US space vulnerability.
Or whether, as in the past, a disabling attack against the country and its
people - a Space Pearl Harbor - will be the only event able to galvanize
the nation and cause the US Government to act.[9]
As early as 1998, the President was warned in his CIA daily briefing that,
bin Laden and his allies are preparing for an attack in the US, including
an aircraft hijacking.
NORAD, the,
North American Aerospace Defense command
also conducted an exercise to counter a terrorist attack involving smashing
an airplane into a building.
In August 1999,
the Federal Aviation
Administration's intelligence branch warned of a possible "suicide hijacking
operation" by Osama Bin Laden.[10]
In October of 2000, the Pentagon undertook an emergency response exercise in
which,
there was a mock terrorist incident at the Pentagon Metro stop and a
construction accident, and it further envisioned a downed passenger
aircraft in the Pentagon courtyard.[11]
For years, NORAD had been conducting military exercises and drills in which
it envisioned planes being hijacked and flown into buildings in the United
States.[12]
One of the intended targets in the NORAD drills was the World
Trade Center:
In another exercise, jets performed a mock shoot-down over the Atlantic Ocean
of a jet supposedly laden with chemical poisons headed toward a target in
the United States. In a third scenario, the target was the Pentagon - but
that drill was not run after Defense officials said it was unrealistic.[13]
As the Guardian revealed in April of 2004:
Five months before the September 11 attacks, US military planners suggested
a war game to practice a response to a terrorist attack using a commercial
airliner flown into the Pentagon, but senior officers rejected the scenario
as "too unrealistic".[14]
In May of 2001, an exercise involving U.S. Central Command, U.S. Special
Operations Command and U.S. Joint Forces Command took place in which the
military establishment forecasted the first war of the 21st century so
closely that,
Nostradamus couldn't have nailed the first battle of the next
war any closer than we did, as articulated by a former top official with
the exercise, Dave Ozolek.
The exercise, Unified Vision 2001:
[G]rew out of the realization that the threat was changing. Ozolek said the
scenario was a major regional threat emanating from the Middle East. The
scenario called for global deployment into a landlocked country with hostile
terrain and a lack of basing and agreements with neighboring countries for
U.S. access.
[...] The threat we portrayed was an unstable and hostile state, but the
primary enemy was not the state itself but a transnational actor based out
of that area, globally connected, capable and willing to conduct terrorist
attacks in the U.S. as part of that campaign.
[...] "Many of the participants in Unified Vision, 100 days later, were
war planners," Ozolek said. They took their experiences in Unified Vision
back to their commands and put them to use as the commands created plans for
operations Enduring Freedom and Noble Eagle, he said. They had an idea of
the tactics, techniques and procedures needed to operate against such an
enemy, he noted.
Ozolek said Unified Vision refutes the pundits who make a living out of
critiquing the Department of Defense. "The first thing they like to talk
about is that we always dwell on the last battle of the last war," he said.
"What we're showing them is that this time we got it right: We really were
looking at the first battle of the next war, and we nailed it pretty darned
close."[15]
After 9/11, in May of 2002, Condoleezza Rice stated that,
I don't think
anybody could have predicted that... they would try to use an airplane as a
missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile.[16]
So Condi is a fool or a
liar, because that statement is nothing if not entirely and utterly false.
The national security apparatus had fully anticipated, and even war gamed
and drilled this very scenario.
It was expected, planned for, and no less
with war plans waiting in the wings.
The 9/11 Commission
Of critical importance in understanding the events of 9/11 is taking note of
the funding for the operation. The 9/11 Commission itself stated:
To date the U.S. government has not been able to determine the origin of the
money used for the 9/11 attacks. Ultimately the question is of little
practical significance.[17]
However, one should take issue with this claim. The fact is that any
comprehensive investigation, criminal or otherwise, should pay special
attention to the role of financing; follow the money. This is not the only
failure of the 9/11 Commission, as has been amply documented.
From its inception, the 9/11 Commission was plagued with problems. The Bush
administration had resisted attempts to form a commission to investigate the
attacks of 9/11 for over a year, even pressuring Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle not to launch an inquiry.[18] In May of 2002, President Bush voiced
his opposition to the formation of a 9/11 commission.[19]
In September of 2002, Bush reversed his previous decision and backed the
proposal to form an independent commission to investigate the attacks.[20]
Within a month of this statement, the White House began undermining the
process, as,
an almost completed Congressional deal was suddenly undone in
October after a Republican lawmaker involved in the final negotiations
received a call from Vice President Dick Cheney, which led to a stalling of
the process.[21]
In mid-November, Congress approved the creation of a bi-partisan 9/11
Commission to investigate the attacks, with 10 Congressmen, 5 Democrats and
5 Republicans, with the Chairman appointed by the Bush administration and
the Vice Chair appointed by the Democrats.[22]
The Bush administration chose as the Chairman none other than Henry
Kissinger, former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State for Nixon
and Ford, a consummate Washington insider, not to mention war criminal.
Even the New York Times had to admit:
Unfortunately, his affinity for power and the commercial interests he has
cultivated since leaving government may make him less than the staunchly
independent figure that is needed for this critical post. Indeed, it is
tempting to wonder if the choice of Mr. Kissinger is not a clever maneuver
by the White House to contain an investigation it long opposed.[23]
Two week later,
Facing questions about potential conflicts of interest,
Henry Kissinger resigned as Chairman of the 9/11 Commission.[24]
He was
replaced with former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean. As of November 2003,
one Commissioner, Max Cleland, claimed that the investigation is now
compromised by the White House.[25]
Shortly after the release of the final 9/11 Commission Report in 2004,
Harpers Magazine called it a cheat and a fraud, declaring the report a
whitewash.[26]
In 2006, the two co-Chairs of the Commission published a book in which they
claimed that the Commission was lied to by both the FAA and the Department
of Defense, specifically NORAD.[27]
Several commissioners are on the record
as saying they felt that the Pentagon purposely lied to them in order to
mislead them.[28] Further, much of the information the commission received
and used in its report was the product of harsh interrogations of al-Qaida
operatives - interrogations that many critics have labeled torture.[29]
As it turned out, the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission, Philip Zelikow, was a man of dubious priorities and connections. He was the
ultimate author of the final report and controlled the research staff of the
commission.
Zelikow,
a former colleague of then-National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice, was appointed executive director of the 9/11 Commission
despite his close ties to the Bush White House, and he remained in regular
contact with [Karl] Rove while overseeing the commission.
Zelikow secretly
spoke with President Bush's close adviser Karl Rove and others within the
White House while the ostensibly autonomous commission was completing its
report.
Zelikow had even previously co-authored a book with Condoleezza
Rice.
Following the publication of the report, Zelikow then went to work as
an adviser to Condoleezza Rice in the White House.[30]
The Bin Ladens
There are many fascinating and important revelations regarding the intricate
relationship between the CIA, the ISI, and al-Qaeda in the lead-up to the
events of 9/11 that deserve to be subjected to more scrutiny.
First, lets take a look at Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden, whose relationship
with the CIA in the past had been well documented, reportedly acted as a
rogue following the 1991 US Gulf War against Iraq and American stationing of
troops and military bases in Saudi Arabia. However, there are reports that
would indicate that the relationship between bin Laden and the US
intelligence apparatus remained, at least to some degree, for many years.
We must remember the nature of al-Qaeda, as an organization, or network, of
intelligence assets funded, armed, trained and dispersed around the world by
a complex network of intelligence agencies from the United States, France,
Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.
A French court undertook a probe into the financial network of Osama bin
Laden, who was widely assumed to simply be independently wealthy, and
financed al-Qaeda operations through his own funds. However, it was revealed
that Osama maintained a joint bank account with his half-brother Yeslam bin
Laden in Switzerland between 1990 and 1997.
Of particular interest to
investigators was,
a 241 million Euro transfer made to Pakistan in 2000 from
an account belonging to a company called Cambridge, a SBG [Saudi Bin Laden
Group] subsidiary, that was opened at Deutsche Bank in Geneva, with the
funds transferred into an account belonging jointly to Osama bin Laden and
someone of Pakistani nationality.[31]
Der Spiegel, a major German newspaper, was granted access to thousands of
pages of intelligence documents relating to bin Laden and al-Qaeda. In the
report on the documents, the authors revealed that when bin Laden needed
financing,
The Saudi elite - and his own family
- came to his
assistance.
The list of financiers:
is a veritable who's who of the Middle Eastern monarchy, including the
signatures of two former cabinet ministers, six bankers and twelve prominent
businessmen. The list also mentions "the bin Laden brothers."... Did "the
bin Laden brothers," who first pledged money to Al-Qaida and then, in 1994,
issued a joint press statement declaring that they were ejecting Osama from
the family as a "black sheep," truly break ties with their blood relatives
- or were they simply pulling the wool over the eyes of the world? [32]
Osama bin Ladens sister-in-law even stated:
I absolutely do not believe that the bin Ladens disowned Osama. In this
family, a brother is always a brother, no matter what he has done. I am
convinced that the complex and tightly woven network between the bin Laden
clan and the Saudi royal family is still in operation.[33]
Following the death of Osamas father, Salem bin Laden, Osamas brother,
became head of the company, Saudi Binladen Group (SBG). As Der Spiegel
reported:
Salem bin Laden established the company's ties to the American political
elite when, according to French intelligence sources, he helped the Reagan
administration circumvent the US Senate and funnel $34 million to the
right-wing Contra rebels operating in Nicaragua. He also developed close
ties with the Bush family in Texas.[34]
While Osama was fighting in Afghanistan against the Soviets, he would often
be personally visited by Saudi Prince Turki, the head of Saudi intelligence,
and was funded by both the Saudi Binladen Group (SBG) and the Saudi royal
family. In 1990, when King Fahd of Saudi Arabia allowed the Americans to
establish military bases in Saudi Arabia, the SBG got the contract to build
the bases.[35]
Though the Bin Laden family claimed Osama was a black sheep and that they
cut off ties with him in the early 1990s, the evidence remains strong that
not only did Osama maintain ties with his family, but he maintained his ties
with Saudi intelligence. While Osama was in Sudan in the early 1990s, Saudi
intelligence would so frequently send his family over to meet with him, and
kept in such close contact with him, that the Israeli intelligence agency,
Mossad, believed Osama was a Saudi spy.
In 1994, under intense public
pressure, both Saudi Arabia and the bin Laden family publicly revoked their
ties with Osama.[36]
Yet, even after this, when Osama returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s to
work with the Taliban, Prince Turki of Saudi intelligence would still
maintain contact and even visit Osama, even bringing gifts such as dozens
of trucks:
According to a former member of the Taliban intelligence service, Prince
Turki and OBL [Osama bin Laden] made a deal: The Saudis would support al-Qaida
financially, but only under the condition that there would be no attacks on
Saudi soil.[37]
On January 9, 2001, Osama attended his sons wedding in Afghanistan,
accompanied by his mother and two brothers, hardly the actions of a black
sheep.
Further, two of Osamas sisters traveled to Abu Dhabi in February of
2001 to deliver large sums of cash to an al-Qaeda agent. In the United
States, the Bin Laden family had diplomatic passports, so following the 9/11
attacks, they could not be questioned, but instead were flown out of the
country.
The Bin Ladens were also in business with the Bush family through
the investment company, the Carlyle Group.[38] No one ever seemed to
question why the bin Laden family had diplomatic passports, a strange
occurrence, it would seem, for a Saudi business family who werent engaged
in any official or formal diplomacy.
In March of 2000, it was reported that
Osama bin Laden was sick and
suffering from kidney and liver disease.[39] A western intelligence source
told the Hong-Kong based magazine, Asiaweek, that bin Laden was dying of
kidney failure.[40]
In July of 2001, Osama bin Laden spent 10 days at the American hospital in
Dubai for treatment. He traveled from Pakistan to Dubai on July 4, 2001, to
be treated in the urology department. While he was in the hospital, Osama
was visited by several members of his family, Saudi officials, and the CIA.
One visitor was Saudi Prince Turki al Faisal, the head of Saudi
intelligence, and the CIA station chief in Dubai, who was soon after
recalled back to Washington.[41]
On September 10, 2001, the night before the attacks of 9/11, Osama bin Laden
was in Pakistan,
getting medical treatment with the support of the very
military that days later pledged its backing for the U.S. war on terror in
Afghanistan.
Pakistani intelligence reported that bin Laden was quickly
taken to a military hospital in Rawalpindi for kidney dialysis treatment.
As
one medical worker said,
they moved out all the regular staff in the
urology department and sent in a secret team to replace them.
Pakistani
President Musharraf openly stated in public that Osama suffers from kidney
disease and is near death.[42]
The Pakistani ISI and 9/11
Throughout the entire time of overt and covert assistance by Pakistans ISI
to both the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, the CIA had maintained its
close ties with the ISI that they had developed during the Soviet-Afghan war
in the 1980s, in which they used the ISI as a conduit; as was set up through
the Safari Club in the 1970s, which was the organization of western
intelligence agencies which used Middle Eastern and Asian intelligence
agencies as conduits for their covert activities.
Thus, the CIA maintained
its extensive contact with the ISI, and so would be well aware of its
activities.[43]
A top Indian intelligence official even stated that,
America's Defence
Intelligence Agency was aware that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)
was sponsoring the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but the Bush Administration chose
to ignore its findings.[44]
Is it inconceivable that since the CIA
maintained its extensive contacts with the ISI, and the ISI maintained and
expanded its contacts with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, that the CIA was not in
fact sponsoring both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda through the ISI as well?
We
know that the CIA was supporting the Taliban through the same network of the ISI that was supporting al-Qaeda operatives,[45] thus it would take a
stretch of the imagination to think that the CIA would be unaware of its
subsequent support for al-Qaeda. Whether direct or indirect, the CIA was
supporting al-Qaeda.
Shortly after 9/11, Indian intelligence became aware of the fact that
General Mahmoud Ahmad, head of Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence (ISI)
had wired $100,000 from Saeed Sheikh, a convicted terrorist who had
associations with the ISI, to Mohamed Atta, the purported ringleader and one
of the 9/11 hijackers.
Thus, the ISI in effect, financed the 9/11 attacks.
However, there are several more ambiguous facets to this story. It just so
happens that General Mahmoud Ahmad went to Washington, D.C. on September
4th, 2001 for a weeklong visit.
On September 10, the day before 9/11, a
Pakistani newspaper ran a story on Ahmads visit:
ISI Chief Lt-Gen Mahmood's week-long presence in Washington has triggered
speculation about the agenda of his mysterious meetings at the Pentagon and
National Security Council. Officially, State Department sources say he is on
a routine visit in return to CIA Director George Tenet's earlier visit to
Islamabad. Official sources confirm that he met Tenet this week. He also
held long parleys with unspecified officials at the White House and the
Pentagon. But the most important meeting was with Mark Grossman, US Under
Secretary of State for Political Affairs.
... What added interest to his visit is the history of such visits. Last
time Ziauddin Butt, Mahmood's predecessor, was here during Nawaz Sharif's
government the domestic politics turned topsy-turvy within days. That this
is not the first visit by Mahmood in the last three months shows the urgency
of the ongoing parleys.[46]
General Ahmad, while in Washington, met with CIA Director George Tenet and
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. On the morning of 9/11, General
Ahmad was in a meeting with the Chairmen of the House and Senate
Intelligence Committees, Senator Bob Graham and Representative Porter Goss,
a former 10-year veteran of CIA clandestine operations. Porter Goss was
later put in charge of a joint House-Senate investigation into the Sept. 11
attacks, and later became the CIA director.[47]
General Mahmoud, having wired $100,000 to Mohamad Atta, the purported lead
9/11 hijacker, implicates the ISI in the attacks of 9/11, at least from a
financial standing.
The FBI even confirmed the transaction took place.[48]
The ISIs extensive ties to American intelligence and the fact that Ahmad
was in D.C. talking to high level legislators, State Department, Pentagon
and intelligence officials begs the question of what the precise nature of
these secret meetings were.
Michael Meacher, a former British MP and member of Tony Blairs cabinet,
wrote in the Guardian that:
Ahmed, the paymaster for the hijackers, was actually in Washington on 9/11,
and had a series of pre-9/11 top-level meetings in the White House, the
Pentagon, the national security council, and with George Tenet, then head of
the CIA, and Marc Grossman, the under-secretary of state for political
affairs. When Ahmed was exposed by the Wall Street Journal as having sent
the money to the hijackers, he was forced to "retire" by President Pervez
Musharraf.[49]
Meacher further discussed the case of Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI
translator-turned-whistleblower who tried to expose evidence of what she saw
as collusion between intelligence agencies and the terrorists behind 9/11.
She was subsequently gagged by the U.S. Department of Justice:
She is a 33-year-old Turkish-American former FBI translator of intelligence,
fluent in Farsi, the language spoken mainly in Iran and Afghanistan, who had
top-secret security clearance. She tried to blow the whistle on the cover-up
of intelligence that names some of the culprits who orchestrated the 9/11
attacks, but is now under two gagging orders that forbid her from testifying
in court or mentioning the names of the people or the countries involved.
She has been quoted as saying:
"My translations of the 9/11 intercepts
included [terrorist] money laundering, detailed and date-specific
information ... if they were to do real investigations, we would see several
significant high-level criminal prosecutions in this country [the US]...
and believe me, they will do everything to cover this up".[50]
In August of 2009, Sibel Edmonds revealed that,
the US was on 'intimate'
terms with the Taliban and al-Qaeda using the militants to further certain
goals in central Asia, and stated, With those groups, we had operations in
Central Asia. She explained that Washington used those groups as we did
during the Afghan and Soviet conflict.[51]
In other words, the US was
arming, funding and using al-Qaeda for its own objectives, just as it always
had.
On September 11, 2009, 8 years to the day of the events of 9/11, a major
British newspaper, the Daily Mail, ran a story critical of the official
story regarding Osama bin Laden. In it, the author posed the question:
What if he has been dead for years, and the British and U.S. intelligence
services are actually playing a game of double bluff? What if everything we
have seen or heard of him on video and audio tapes since the early days
after 9/11 is a fake - and that he is being kept 'alive' by the Western
allies to stir up support for the war on terror?[52]
The article quoted former U.S. foreign intelligence officer and senior
editor Angelo M. Codevilla, a professor of international relations at Boston
University as saying,
All the evidence suggests Elvis Presley is
more alive today than Osama Bin Laden
Prof Codevilla asserted: 'The video and audio tapes alleged to be Osama's
never convince the impartial observer,' he asserted. 'The guy just does not
look like Osama. Some videos show him with a Semitic, aquiline nose, while
others show him with a shorter, broader one. Next to that, differences
between the colours and styles of his beard are small stuff.'[53]
Interesting to note is that following the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, in
at least four separate statements to Middle Eastern press and media, stated
that he did not take part in the 9/11 attacks, while the video in which he
supposedly claimed responsibility for the attacks has him wearing gold
rings, which is forbidden by his Wahhabist religion, as well as writing with
his right hand, whereas the FBI website says that he is left handed, and his
face is blurred and difficult to make out.
On September 28, 2001, Osama bin
Laden said,
'I have already said I am not involved. As a Muslim, I try my
best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge... nor do I consider the
killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable
act.[54]
Osama bin Laden was even reported to have died of kidney failure on December
13, 2001, in the mountains of Tora Bora on the Afghan-Pakistan border.
On
that same day, the U.S. government released the fateful videotape in which
Osama claimed responsibility for the attacks. However, the bin Laden in the
video was very different from the known images of the real bin Laden, and
even had a different shaped nose, his beard was darker, his skin paler, and
his fingers were no longer long and thin, as well as the fact that he looked
to be in good health.[55]
As the Los Angeles Times reported in November of 2009, the extensive and
close relationship between the CIA and the ISI has not diminished since
9/11, but had in fact, accelerated:
the CIA has funneled hundreds of
millions of dollars to Pakistan's intelligence service since the Sept. 11
attacks, accounting for as much as one-third of the foreign spy agency's
annual budget.
Further,
the payments to Pakistan are authorized under a
covert program initially approved by then-President Bush and continued under
President Obama.
Further,
the CIA has routinely brought ISI operatives to
a secret training facility in North Carolina, and as the article pointed
out, the CIA also directs millions of dollars to other foreign spy
services. But the magnitude of the payments to the ISI reflect Pakistan's
central role.
As the report in the Los Angeles Times explained, the CIA
financial support to the ISI began during the Afghan-Soviet conflict, and
has not stopped since then, and since 9/11, it has actually accelerated.[56]
The Nexus Personified
- The Case of Ali Mohamed
Perhaps the perfect example of the complex relationship and nexus between
intelligence agencies and al-Qaeda is the case of a man named Ali Mohamed.
As the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2001,
A former U.S. Army
sergeant who trained Osama bin Laden's bodyguards and helped plan the 1998
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya was a U.S. government informant during
much of his terrorist career.
Ali Mohamed, an Egyptian-born US citizen had
approached the CIA in the mid-1980s to inform for them.
He also spent years
as an FBI informant, all the while being a top-level al-Qaeda operative,
even training Osama bin Ladens bodyguards, as well as training terrorists
in camps in Afghanistan and Sudan, and planned the 1998 US Embassy bombing
in Kenya.[57]
State Department officials proclaimed this was merely a sign of the problems
associated with recruiting informants, that Mohamed was a double agent
working for al-Qaeda, and they should have known better. However, the
ignorance plea can only go so far, and considering Mohameds extensive ties
to not one, but several US agencies, there is no doubt he was a double
agent, but perhaps it is more likely he was working as an al-Qaeda operative
for the US government.
After all, it is one thing to say the Ali Mohamed was
lucky in his evading being caught, but he was continuously lucky, over and
over again. One wonders when luck is organized.
In 1971, Ali Mohamed joined the Egyptian Army, rising to the rank of major.
Well educated in Egypt, he was fluent in English.
In 1981, he joined the
Egyptian Islamic Jihad,
a group of radical Muslim fundamentalists opposed
to the Egyptian government's ties to the United States and Israel that
included members of the Egyptian military.
The very same year, in 1981,
Mohamed traveled to the United States for the first time,
graduating from a
special program for foreign officers at the U.S. Army Special Forces school
at Fort Bragg, N.C.
In 1984, Mohamed left the Egyptian military.[58]
In 1984, Ali Mohamed approached the CIA office in Egypt offering to be a
spy. Officially, the CIA then cut off contact with him shortly thereafter,
as he made contact with terrorist organizations and informed them he was
working with the CIA, supposedly proposing to spy on US intelligence
agencies. So the CIA had the State Department add him to a watch list so
that he could not enter the United States.
However, the next year, Ali
Mohamed obtained a visa from the American Embassy and went to the United
States. He then joined the American Army and served with one of its most
elite units.[59]
From 1986 until 1989, Ali Mohamed served at the Armys Special Forces base
in Fort Bragg, N.C., until he was honorably discharged in 1989. While on
active duty, he went to New York where he trained local Muslims in military
tactics to go fight in the Afghan-Soviet war.
One of his students was,
El Sayyid A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted of killing Rabbi Meir
Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League, in 1990, which was the
first recorded al-Qaeda operation on U.S. soil.[60]
In the early 1990s, Ali Mohamed began working for the FBI.
Mohamed then
forged ties with Osama bin Laden as early as 1991, and assisted in a variety
of ways, such as helping bin Laden and al-Qaeda obtain fake documents,
assisted with logistical tasks, and even helped Osama relocate from
Afghanistan to the Sudan in 1991. Many terrorists that Mohamed trained were
subsequently involved in the 1993 plot to blow up the World Trade Center. In
1992, Mohamed returned to Afghanistan to continue training militants. That
same year, he was detained by officials in Rome, yet was released shortly
thereafter.[61]
In 1992, Ali Mohamed created an al-Qaeda terrorist cell in Kenya, and in
1993, bin Laden asked Mohamed to scout for potential terrorist targets in
Nairobi, Kenya. He took photos of and scouted the French Embassy, the US AID
office and the American Embassy. Bin Laden subsequently chose the American
Embassy as the target.[62]
In 1993, he was detained by the RCMP in Vancouver, Canada,
while traveling
in the company of a suspected associate of Mr. bin Laden's who was trying to
enter the United States using false documents.[63]
However, after the RCMP
were told to contact his FBI handlers, Mohamed was released.[64] He
subsequently masterminded the American Embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania in 1998.[65]
However, there are implications that may suggest that Ali Mohameds ties to
the CIA did not end or evaporate in the 1980s.
Following 9/11, several
revelations were reported in the media about a covert program of allowing
high-level terrorists to enter the United States under a secret CIA program
which had the State Department issue visas to terrorists in order to enter
the United States.
The CIA Brings Terrorists to America
Michael Springman, former State Department official and head of the US Visa
Bureau in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from 1987 to 1989, went public with his
experiences.
He stated that,
In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by
high level State Dept officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants,
and that he would complain to an assortment of different departments and
agencies, however, his complaints were met with silence.
He elaborated,
What I was protesting was, in reality, an effort to bring recruits, rounded
up by Osama Bin Laden, to the US for terrorist training by the CIA. They
would then be returned to Afghanistan to fight against the then-Soviets.
Further:
The attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 did not shake the State
Department's faith in the Saudis, nor did the attack on American barracks at
Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia three years later, in which 19 Americans died.
FBI agents began to feel their investigation was being obstructed. Would you
be surprised to find out that FBI agents are a bit frustrated that they
can't be looking into some Saudi connections?[66]
As Springman further revealed in an interview with the CBC, Sheikh
Abdel
Rahman, the terrorist widely considered to have played a key role in the
first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, was issued a visa from a CIA case
officer in Sudan,
And that 15 or so of the people who came from Saudi
Arabia to participate in the attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon [on 9/11]
had gotten their visas through the American consular general at Jeddah.
The
interviewer asked if this suggests that this pipeline of visa applications
issued by the CIA to terrorists was never wrapped up, and Springman replied:
Exactly. I had thought it had been, because I had raised sufficient hell
that I thought they had done it. I had complained to the embassy in Riyadh,
I had complained to the diplomatic security in Washington, I had complained
to the General Accounting Office, I had complained to the State Department
Inspector General's office, and I had complained to the Bureau of Consular
Affairs at the State Department. Apparently the reverberations from this
where heard all over the State Department.[67]
Eventually, the State Department fired Springman without a sufficient
reason.
As he explained, the same program in which he was ordered to allow
terrorists to enter the United States in the late 1980s had continued and 15
of the 19 suspected 9/11 hijackers were issued visas through this network.
It further turned out that Ali Mohamed was,
admitted to the United States
under a special visa program controlled by the C.I.A.'s clandestine
service, and he had claimed to be working for the CIA.[68]
In the mid-1990s, Ali Mohamed helped al-Qaedas current number two,
presumably after Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, to come to California
and raise money for al-Qaeda operations.
In 2000, Ali Mohamed was called in
for questioning and was subsequently arrested in relation to involvement
with the 1998 embassy bombings and is being kept in an undisclosed
location.[69]
Thus, we have a perfect example of the terror nexus in Ali Mohamed:
simultaneously having connections with the CIA, the FBI, the Army, and
al-Qaeda.
His high-level status within al-Qaeda could not have taken place
without the knowledge and support of his handlers. Mohamed was a double
agent, that much is for sure, but for whom was he really working?
Considering he has disappeared into the abyss of National Security, the
answers might never be fully known.
However, this does provide more evidence
as to the covert relationship that the United States maintained with
al-Qaeda.
Able Danger - Tracking the 9/11 Terrorists
Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, a military intelligence officer, revealed his
in-depth knowledge of having worked with the Pentagons ultra-secret Able
Danger program.
Able Danger,
was begun in 1999 at the request of General
Hugh Shelton, then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and under the
direct supervision of General Pete Schoomaker, then the commander of the
Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
The CIA, however, had refused to
cooperate with the
Able Danger program, which was designed to track down
terrorists, and developed a specific focus on al-Qaeda.
Raytheon, a private
military contracting corporation, was involved in this data-mining military
intelligence program.
Once Schaffer went public with information about the
program, the,
then deputy director of operations at the Defense Intelligence
Agency essentially pulled the plug on his involvement with Able Danger.[70]
In September of 2000, more than a year before 9/11, Able Danger,
a small,
highly classified military intelligence unit identified Mohammed Atta and
three other future hijackers as likely members of a cell of Al Qaeda
operating in the United States, and in the summer of 2000, Able Danger
recommended that the information be shared with the FBI to go in and remove
the terrorist cell.
However, the information was not shared and the
recommendation was rejected, apparently because,
Mr. Atta, and the others
were in the United States on valid entry visas.
Further:
A former spokesman for the Sept. 11 commission, Al Felzenberg, confirmed
that members of its staff, including Philip Zelikow [a friend of Condi Rice
who later joined the Bush administration], the executive director, were told
about the program on an overseas trip in October 2003 that included stops in
Afghanistan and Pakistan.[71]
A Pentagon spokesman said that the 9/11 Commission looked into the issue
during the Commission hearings; however, they chose not to include it in
the final report.[72]
Other intelligence officers and sources came forward
to reveal and validate the claims made about Able Danger, including J.D.
Smith, a defense contractor who confirmed that Able Danger had identified Atta.
Further, Navy Captain Scott Philpott has also gone on record along
with Schaffer, claiming that they were discouraged from looking further
into Atta and their attempts to share information with the FBI were
thwarted.[73] Congress then began an investigation into the Able Danger
program.
According to Congressional testimony:
Pentagon lawyers during the Clinton administration ordered the destruction
of intelligence reports that identified September 11 leader Mohamed Atta
months before the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center.[74]
Further, in 2004, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),
destroyed files on
the Army's computer data-mining program known as Able Danger to avoid
disclosing the information:
Retired Army Maj. Erik Kleinsmith, former director of the Army Land
Information Warfare Center, told the panel he was directed by Pentagon
lawyers to delete 2 terabytes of computer data - the equivalent of
one-quarter of the information in the Library of Congress - on Able Danger
in May or June 2000 because of legal concerns about information on U.S.
citizens.[75]
In September of 2005, as the Senate investigation into Able Danger was
underway, several Senators from both parties accused the Defense Department,
of obstructing an investigation into whether a highly classified
intelligence program known as Able Danger did indeed identify Mohamed Atta
and other future hijackers as potential threats well before the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
This occurred after the Pentagon blocked
several witnesses from testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a
public hearing.[76]
The Pentagon even acknowledged that,
it had blocked several military
officers and intelligence analysts from testifying at an open Congressional
hearing about a highly classified intelligence program.
A Pentagon
spokesman said open testimony would not be appropriate.[77]
The 9/11 Commission, despite testimony from Col. Schaffer and other
individuals about the Able Danger program, had dismissed Able Danger as not
historically significant, and justified leaving it out of the final report,
which stated that,
American intelligence agencies were unaware of Mr. Atta
until the day of the attacks.
Louis Freeh, a former FBI Director, wrote in
an article in the Wall Street Journal, that this assertion by the 9/11
Commission is embarrassingly wrong, especially since Commission members
had acknowledged in 2005 (a year after the release of the 9/11 Commission
Report), that they had met with Able Danger officials who did mention they
were tracking Atta prior to 9/11.[78]
Further, more information was revealed regarding the relationship many
supposed hijackers had with the US intelligence community, as it was
revealed by Newsweek in 2002 that two hijackers were identified by the CIA
in January of 2000 when they attended an al-Qaeda meeting in Malaysia.
However, the two men then went to San Diego where they attended flight
school, where they,
moved into the home of a Muslim man who had befriended
them at the local Islamic Center. The landlord regularly prayed with them
and even helped one open a bank account.
However, their landlord also
happened to be an undercover asset for the FBI, yet nothing was done.[79]
Immediately following the 9/11 attacks, it was reported by Newsweek that the
military gave information to the FBI which alleged that 5 of the 9/11
hijackers had,
received training at secure U.S. military installations in
the 1990s.
Further,
three of the alleged hijackers listed their address on
drivers licenses and car registrations as the Naval Air Station in
Pensacola.
Newsweek continued:
But there are slight discrepancies between the military training records and
the official FBI list of suspected hijackers-either in the spellings of
their names or with their birthdates. One military source said it is
possible that the hijackers may have stolen the identities of the foreign
nationals who studied at the U.S. installations.[80]
Could the use of false identities or dual identities be the reason why, in
late September of 2001, it was reported that four of the alleged 9/11
hijackers had turned out to be alive and well, and living in the Middle
East?
The FBI released the list of the 19 purported 9/11 hijackers, and some
of the names and photographs on the list show people who were still alive, a
remarkable feat for someone accused of crashing a plane in a suicide
mission. Even the FBI director in late September of 2001 agreed that the
identity of many of the hijackers was still in doubt.[81]
Yet, these were
not questions addressed by the 9/11 Commission.
It must be looked at and addressed much more closely and critically; the
role between the U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies to what is
known as al-Qaeda.
Given our historical understanding of al-Qaeda as a
database of intelligence assets, which were recruited to fight the
Afghan-Soviet war, and our more recent understanding of the relationships
between various intelligence agencies historically and presently to these
groups and individuals, does it not seem plausible that the operation of
al-Qaeda as a covert branch of U.S. policy has continued?
Certainly, more
research needs to be undertaken, but what is clear is that any and all
official investigations thus far have been nothing but concocted lies: that
is, willful and intended deception, designed to hide the truth, not reveal
it.
It is also within this context, of understanding the deep nexus of
intelligence and terrorism in international relations and imperial
stratagems (that is, strategic deception), that we must view the rise, role,
evolution and purpose of the Global War on Terror, now in its 9th year,
spending trillions to send poor Americans to kill poor Muslims in nations
across the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South Asia.
