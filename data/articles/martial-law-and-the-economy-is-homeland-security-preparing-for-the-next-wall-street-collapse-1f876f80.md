Reports are that the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) is engaged in a massive, covert military buildup.
An article in the Associated Press in February confirmed an open
purchase order by DHS for 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
According to an op-ed in Forbes, thats enough to sustain an Iraq-sized
war for over twenty years. DHS has also acquired heavily armored tanks,
which have been seen roaming the streets. Evidently somebody in government
is expecting some serious civil unrest.
The question is, why?
Recently revealed statements by former UK Prime
Minister Gordon Brown at the height of the banking crisis in October 2008
could give some insights into that question.
An
article on BBC News
on September 21, 2013, drew from an explosive autobiography called
Power Trip
by Browns spin doctor Damian McBride, who said the prime minister
was worried that law and order could collapse during the financial crisis.
McBride quoted Brown as saying:
If the banks are shutting their doors, and
the cash points arent working, and people go to Tesco [a grocery chain]
and their cards arent being accepted, the whole thing will just
explode.
If you cant buy food or petrol or medicine
for your kids, people will just start breaking the windows and helping
themselves.
And as soon as people see that on TV, thats
the end, because everyone will think thats OK now, thats just what we
all have to do. Itll be anarchy. Thats what could happen tomorrow.
How to deal with that threat?
Brown said,
"Wed have to think: do we have curfews, do
we put the Army on the streets, how do we get order back?"
McBride wrote in his book Power Trip,
"It
was extraordinary to see Gordon so totally gripped by the danger of what he
was about to do, but equally convinced that decisive action had to be taken
immediately."
He compared the threat to the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Fear of this threat was echoed in September 2008
by US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, who
reportedly warned that the US government might have to resort to martial
law if Wall Street were not bailed out from the credit collapse.
In both countries, martial law was avoided when
their legislatures succumbed to pressure and bailed out the banks. But many
pundits are saying that another collapse is imminent; and this time,
governments may not be so willing to step up to the plate.
The Next Time WILL Be
Different
What triggered the 2008 crisis was
a run, not in the conventional banking system, but in
the "shadow" banking
system, a collection of non-bank financial intermediaries that provide
services similar to traditional commercial banks but are unregulated.
They include,
Investment banks and commercial banks may also conduct
much of their business in the shadows of this unregulated system.
The shadow financial casino has only grown
larger since 2008; and in the next Lehman-style collapse, government
bailouts may not be available. According to President Obama in his
remarks on the Dodd-Frank Act on July 15, 2010,
"Because of this reform... there will be no
more taxpayer funded bailouts period."
Governments in Europe are also shying away from
further bailouts.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) in Switzerland has
therefore required the systemically risky banks to devise "living wills"
setting forth what they will do in the event of insolvency.
The template
established by the FSB requires them to "bail in" their creditors; and
depositors, it turns out, are the largest class of bank creditor. (For
fuller discussion, see my earlier article
here.)
When depositors cannot access their bank
accounts to get money for food for the kids, they could well start breaking
store windows and helping themselves. Worse, they might plot to overthrow
the financier-controlled government.
Witness Greece, where increasing
disillusionment with the ability of the government to rescue the citizens
from the worst depression since 1929 has precipitated
riots and threats of violent overthrow.
Fear of that result could explain the massive,
government-authorized spying on American citizens, the domestic use of
drones, and the elimination of due process and of "posse comitatus" (the
federal law prohibiting the military from enforcing "law and order" on
non-federal property).
Constitutional protections are being thrown out the
window in favor of protecting the elite class in power.
The Looming Debt Ceiling
Crisis
The next crisis on the agenda appears to be the
October 17th deadline for agreeing on a federal budget or
risking default on the governments loans.
It may only be a coincidence, but two
large-scale drills are scheduled to take place the same day,
According to a Bloomberg news clip on
the bank drill, the attacks being prepared for are from hackers,
state-sponsored espionage, and organized crime (financial fraud).
One
interviewee stated,
"You might experience that your online banking is
down... You might experience that you cant log in."
It sounds like a dress
rehearsal for the Great American Bail-in.
Ominous as all this is, it has a bright side.
Bail-ins and martial law can be seen as the last desperate thrashings of a
dinosaur. The exploitative financial scheme responsible for turning millions
out of their jobs and their homes has reached the end of the line. Crisis in
the current scheme means opportunity for those more sustainable solutions
waiting in the wings.
Other countries faced with a collapse in their
debt-based borrowed currencies have survived and thrived by issuing their
own.
When the dollar-pegged currency collapsed in Argentina in 2001, the
national government returned to issuing its own pesos; municipal governments
paid with "debt-canceling bonds" that circulated as currency; and
neighborhoods traded with community currencies.
After the German currency
collapsed in the 1920s, the government turned the economy around in the
1930s by issuing "MEFO" bills that circulated as currency. When England ran
out of gold in 1914,
the government issued "Bradbury pounds" similar to the Greenbacks issued
by Abraham Lincoln during the US Civil War.
Today our government could avoid the debt
ceiling crisis by doing something similar: it could simply mint some
trillion dollar coins and deposit them in an account. That alternative could
be pursued by the Administration immediately, without going to Congress or
changing the law, as discussed in my earlier article
here.
It need not be inflationary, since Congress could still spend only
what it passed in its budget.
And if Congress did expand its budget for
infrastructure and job creation, that would actually be good for the
economy, since
hoarding cash and paying down loans have significantly shrunk the
circulating money supply.
Peer-to-peer Trading and
Public Banks
At the local level, we need to set up an
alternative system that provides safety for depositors, funds small and
medium-sized businesses, and serves the needs of the community.
Much progress has already been made on that
front in the peer-to-peer economy.
In a September 27th article titled "Peer-to-Peer
Economy Thrives as Activists Vacate the System," Eric Blair reports that
the Occupy Movement is engaged in a peaceful revolution in which people are
abandoning the established system in favor of a "sharing economy."
Trading
occurs between individuals, without taxes, regulations or licenses, and in
some cases without government-issued currency.
Peer-to-peer trading happens largely on the
Internet, where customer reviews rather than regulation keep sellers honest.
It started with eBay and Craigslist and has grown exponentially since.
Bitcoin is a private currency outside the prying eyes of regulators.
Software is being devised that
circumvents NSA spying. Bank loans are being shunned in favor of
crowdfunding.
Local food co-ops are also a form of opting out of the
corporate-government system.
Peer-to-peer trading works for local exchange,
but we also need a way to protect our dollars, both public and private. We
need dollars to pay at least some of our bills, and businesses need them to
acquire raw materials.
We also need a way to protect our public revenues,
which are currently deposited and invested in Wall Street banks that have
heavy derivatives exposure.
To meet those needs, we can set up
publicly-owned banks on the model of the Bank of North Dakota, currently our
only state-owned depository bank. The BND is mandated by law to receive all
the states deposits and to serve the public interest. Ideally, every state
would have one of these "mini-Feds." Counties and cities could have them as
well.

Preparations for martial law have been reported
for decades, and it hasnt happened yet.
Hopefully, we can sidestep that
danger by moving into a saner, more sustainable system that makes military
action against American citizens unnecessary.
