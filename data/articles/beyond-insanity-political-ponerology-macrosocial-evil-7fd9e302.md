We used to call them psychopaths - these
creatures that appear on our planet physically in human form, but
are not human beings.
-
We noted they are amoral. That should
have given us a clue.
-
We noted they do not FEEL feelings. That
should have instructed us.
-
We noted they are heartless. That should
have set off the alarm.
-
These creatures lack elements which
distinguish the human being.
-
They exhibit no connection with, no
understanding of what we call "morality," "honesty," "decency,"
"fair play," etc.
-
They lack the faculty we call empathy.
-
They lack the faculty we call
introspection.
Mankind has spent centuries trying to make sense
of these creatures as some form of human being. All in vain. Not only in
vain, but at enormous on-going cost to our civilization. These creatures are
not human beings gone wrong. They are a different species... dedicated to
the murder of human values... as a prelude to the murder of human beings...
e.g., the tactics used by Nazis, past and present.
They laugh at us.
They say:
"No one understands us. People can't put
themselves in the minds of men who act without a conscience. They try to
understand, but they can't."
These creatures do not THINK human. They do not
SPEAK human. They do not know what it is to BE human.
We classify them as "humanoid."
Yes, they have human form. If we manage to resist their onslaught long
enough, we will eventually develop technical scanning equipment which will
measure how different they are from human beings, despite their similarity
of form.
In the meantime, the quality of our lives... and often our very lives...
depends on our recognizing these creatures for what they are, and taking
steps to neutralize their attempts to destroy us.
EVIDENCE OF HUMANOID
BEHAVIOR
They make pronouncements without substantiation. To them, these
pronouncements represent what reality is... pronouncement by pronouncement.
The present pronouncement may contradict what they said a moment ago. This
means nothing to them. They make no attempt to deal with the contradiction.
They demonstrate a total lack of understanding what we mean by a "fact." In
their writings and in their speech, they do not use that word.
We humans find this hard to believe. The use of facts is such a basic part
of our lives. We base our conclusions and our actions on them. We go on from
there to test things and establish more facts. When we debate, we present
facts, and show how we derive our observations and our positions from them.
Without facts, all we have is what we call "fantasy."
Since these
creatures have a human appearance, we assume they must think
like us... be aware of what we are aware. We think they MUST know what facts
are. When they don't address the facts, we say they are playing a game. We
think they do know what the facts are, but don't want to admit it.
Not so! They DON'T know what a fact is. When we speak of facts and ask them
to address the facts, they look at us with vacant eyes. They don't know what
we're talking about.
They study us because their strategy is to pass as human. They hear us use
the words -- facts, evidence, substantiation. They lack the human capacity
to understand what we mean. What they do is ignore our reference to facts,
ignore our requests for them to supply facts, and hope we won't notice it's
due to their lack of comprehension.
Let's look at examples of what THEY use for what WE mean by "facts."
-
The Association for the Advancement of Gestalt Therapy (AAGT) held an open
conference at which three "master" therapists worked with three volunteers.
Dr. Jeffrey A. Schaler published a critique entitled "BAD THERAPY" in which
he cited examples not only of bad therapy, but also of systematic abuse of a
volunteer by the "master" therapist. (The Interpsych Newsletter, Vol 2,
Issue 9, Nov 95.)
On their official Internet mail list (aagt@netride.com),
members of the Association launched an attack on Dr. Schaler, culminating in
their adoption of the slogan: "Saving Gestalt Therapy from Jeff Schaler,"
used as the subject line in a discussion thread. Under this heading they
"SAVED" Gestalt therapy by sending in e-mails labeling Jeff Schaler as
"arrogant, snide, hair-splitting, nit-picking, disturbed, mean- spirited,
ranting, self-serving," etc.
When asked how this labeling "SAVED" Gestalt therapy, they ignored the
question. When asked in what way Gestalt therapy was endangered by Jeff
Schaler, they ignored the question.
It became clear they thoroughly believed their pronouncements erased not
only the evidence presented but also erased Jeff Schaler himself. They
"pronounced" him to be no longer in existence. For them, whatever they
"declare" is what's real. What WE call reality is not real to them. THEY
"pronounce" what is to be considered real.

Here's another example. I asked a psychotherapy client to look at a chair
which was situated about six feet away near a wall. I then asked her to
describe the chair. She did, in rather complete detail, except for the legs.
THE CHAIR SHE DESCRIBED HAD NO LEGS!
I pointed this out, and asked how the chair could be suspended in air, with
no legs to support it.
She said: "I put it there."
I asked: "If you look away, will it fall to
the floor?"
She said: "No. If I look away, the chair is
no longer there."
I asked: "If you look away... and it turns
out the chair is still there?"
She ignored the question.
-
Here's another example. During a discussion on CD@maelstrom.stjohns.edu
earlier this year, the statement was made:
"If enough people believe something to be
true, then what they believe is what reality IS."
A question was then asked:
"There was a time when everyone, as far as
we know, believed the sun revolved around the earth. Are you saying at
that time the sun did, in fact, revolve around the earth... and it was
only in obedience to a change in what people believed that the earth
came to revolve around the sun?"
The question was ignored.
You might think their refusals to answer constitute an admission... an
admission what they are saying is totally outlandish and indefensible.
Experience has shown you would be wrong. Experience has shown they go right
on making the same statements, even after evidence is produced to the
contrary.
You see how different these creatures are? You see how far off their
thinking and behavior are from human thinking and behavior?
Nothing of what WE call reality is real to THEM.
I repeat...
Nothing of what we call reality is REAL to them.
When a human being mentions a chair, the reference is to a chair that sits
there on its own legs. It's there whether anyone sees it or not, whether
anyone mentions it or not, whether anyone "declares" it to be there or not.
It's there ON ITS OWN.
A basic element in the profile of humanoids is their lack of comprehension
that anything exists on its own, separate from their say-so. They don't SEE
it. The only objects humanoids see are the ones they "declare"... the ones
they imagine.
We use the phrase "my perception" to mean an appraisal, a measurement of
something separate from ourselves. We don't announce it as "fact." We are
open to consider other views if given facts to consider.
Humanoids use the phrase "my perception" as a buzz word. They imagine what
they choose, and tell us it is their "perception"... which, in their minds,
ESTABLISHES reality. What we call "facts" do not exist for them. That's why
they whine and claim they are being attacked whenever substantiation is
requested.
Humanoids claim their statements are valid simply because they make them!!!
They elaborate on this:
"I honor integrity in this regard. As an
egoist, I make statements which are valid to me. Validity to my 'self'
comes first. I grant other people this same respect assuming they say
things valid to themselves."
Among human beings, for something to be deemed
valid it has to be substantiated with facts. Nothing is valid simply because
someone says it.
When humanoids are asked how they determine what someone says is valid to
that person, and not something made up or imagined, they ignore the
question.
Note the strange use of the word "integrity." Humans define integrity as
uprightness of character; probity; honesty. We refer to sticking to the
facts, sticking to the truth, not selling out. Humanoids use "integrity" to
mean insisting what they imagine is what's real. No measurement. No
evaluation.
When the demand is made for their pronouncements to be evaluated, they claim
the confronter is the one who has no integrity... meaning the confronter is
not upholding THEIR position: what THEY imagine is what's real.
On what basis do they claim this?
Humanoids treat the world as if it were their
own private holodeck. They "declare" things into being. Everything is a
hologram. They program the holograms. They interact with them in any way
they choose. They have them under total control. When they decide to cancel
a hologram, it vanishes.
A hologram is a hologram is a hologram. A hologram is not supposed to have
the ability to think for itself. A hologram is not supposed to have the
ability to measure, evaluate, appraise, etc. Most importantly, a hologram is
not supposed to be able to break out of its holographic state and critique
its master.
When this does happen, they first chastise it to bring it back into line. If
that doesn't work, they "vanish" it. When that fails, they run for cover by
abandoning the program and calling up another one.
Experience has shown no matter what we say, no matter what we point out, no
matter how much evidence is given, it has no meaning for these creatures.
They have one goal: to fool us into classifying them as human so they can
concentrate on murdering our human values. Without human values, the next
step is murdering human beings.
In the film "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers," aliens are shown to be
taking over by occupying the bodies of human beings.
The aliens take over not only the physical body
but also the mind, memories, abilities, etc. In every way the people seem to
be the same as always, except for one thing. They mention events, but with
no feeling of them or about them. THEY DO NOT FEEL FEELINGS.
We see a child struggling to get away from what appears to be its mother.
The next day they walk hand-in-hand. The child has been taken over.
The lovers in the film try to stay awake so they won't be taken over. She
succumbs... and "she," now a creature, tries to fool him. When she doesn't
fool him, she tries to betray him.
These creatures do not FEEL alive. They do not FEEL feelings. In order to
pass as humans, they know they have to give the appearance of knowing they
are alive. Their only recourse is to DECLARE they are alive.
The declaration does not produce the quality of FEELING alive. They still
don't FEEL feelings. The only thing they have to go on, to refer to, is
their own declaration. If "declaring" is shown to be insufficient... if they
are called upon to discuss feelings, give evidence of feelings, distinguish
between feelings, etc., they are lost.
Their inner emptiness is apparent. Their
un-human status is exposed.
Here's a final example.
In the course of a discussion on psych-ci@maelstrom.stjohns.edu
some time ago, a humanoid said:
"You hurt my feelings."
The humanoid was
asked to identify the exact statements, and explain in what way these
statements caused hurt to what particular feelings.
Answer: (Whining)
"I've
said you hurt my feelings. I don't know what else to say... You are
attacking."
Question:
"In what way do you a consider a request for substantiation and
clarification to be an attack?"
No answer.
AN OVERVIEW
Humanoids:
-
Make pronouncements without
substantiation. These pronouncements are to be accepted as defining
what reality is... moment by moment.
-
Ignore requests to provide the basis for
their pronouncements.
-
Sneer at the human valuing of facts,
honesty, decency, fair play.
-
Applaud the use of lies, deceit, etc.
-
Whine they are being "attacked" whenever
they are questioned. Give no explanation of what the "attack" is or
of what is being attacked.
-
Do not FEEL feelings.
-
View the world as their private holodeck.
-
Apply themselves to keeping humans in
their place - namely, insignificance.
FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Humanoids do not understand the distinction we humans make between good and
evil. When they harm us, they do not understand why we call them evil. They
do not understand why we have laws against murder. Their approach is to
boast, even moralize over their victims.
Since they do not understand the reason for such laws, they argue they
cannot be held accountable for their actions.
Not so. While they take the position the law does not apply to them, they do
know the law was enacted to apply to everyone.
Furthermore, if they try to
claim they didn't know there was such a law, we respond with a firmly
established principle:
"Ignorance of the law is no excuse."
When they use those arguments, they make it
clear they will continue to operate in accordance with their structure.
We
may look for remorse (a human capacity). We find none. They do not think of
themselves as promulgating evil. They are simply doing what it is in their
structure to do. The rattlesnake does not think of itself as evil when it
injects poison. It is simply doing what it is in its structure to do.
Experience has shown humanoids continue to behave in the ways of their
species... murdering human values as a prelude to murdering human beings.
Nazis demonstrate this graphically.
The issue as to whether to hold them "accountable," in our human sense of
the word, has to be divided into two parts. We do not hold them accountable
for BEING what they are. We do hold them accountable for the damage they DO.
When a dog gets rabies, we don't hold the dog accountable for becoming
rabid. What we do, as a matter of self-protection, is put the dog down
BEFORE it bites us, BEFORE it infects us.
We do not hold the rattlesnake accountable for HAVING poison fangs. What we
do, as a matter of self-protection, is kill the rattlesnake BEFORE it kills
us.
So with the humanoid.
We need to be on our guard at the first sign of a
murder of human values.
