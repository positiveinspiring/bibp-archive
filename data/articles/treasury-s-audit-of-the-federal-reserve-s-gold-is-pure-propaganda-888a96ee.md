The U.S. Treasury just released
a new report claiming to have performed an audit of
U.S. gold held by the Federal Reserve.
To be blunt, the report is a complete joke. The
report says that the Treasurys Office of Inspector General performed an
audit of the U.S. Treasurys schedule of U.S. gold reserves held by the
Federal Reserve.
In other words the report states that they
performed an audit of a paper trail and not the actual gold itself. What
good is this so-called audit if all they did was check some numbers listed
on a schedule?
There is little doubt that this report is part
of a deliberate disinformation campaign to mislead people into believing
that a real audit of U.S. gold reserves was performed.
This is a direct quote from the Treasurys
report stating that they audited a schedule.
We have
audited the accompanying Department of the Treasurys Schedule of United
States Gold Reserves Held by Federal Reserve Banks as of September 30,
2012 (the Schedule). This report presents our unqualified opinion on
this Schedule.
In fact the entire section dedicated to
describing the scope of the audit only mentions auditing and confirming that
the numbers in the schedule are correct.
There is nothing in the report that talks about
a physical audit of the gold itself so even calling this an audit is
generous at best. As expected their opinion on the schedule claims
that nothing is wrong and that the general public should assume that
everything is fine with the gold reserves.
Heres the full opinion from the
Treasury Inspector General as stated in the report.
In our
opinion, the accompanying Schedule presents fairly, in all material
respects, the balance of the Department of the Treasurys United States
Gold Reserves Held by Federal Reserve Banks as of September 30, 2012, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Whats really strange about this is that there
are reports from the
Los Angeles Times and other news outlets
quoting some mystery representative from the Treasurys Office of Inspector
General who says that they spent time counting and testing the purity of the
gold bars held by the FED.
The mystery representative even goes on to claim
that three of the gold bars they tested were of higher purity than they
originally thought.
Specifically, the Los Angeles Times report says
that weeks were spent counting and testing the gold. If they spent all of
this time doing this than why is there no reference to these activities
listed in the report? One would think that it would be important to mention
these things if a real accounting of the gold took place. Most likely
however, these statements from this unnamed source are either grossly
exaggerated or outright lies.
The vast majority of U.S. gold is not held by
the FED but elsewhere in places like Fort Knox and Denver. So even if we
assume that this was a legitimate audit, the Treasurys report fails to
account for most of the gold reserves. What good is this report if it only
examined a small fraction of the aggregate total of gold?
In order to get a real handle on whats going on
with these gold reserves, a true independent audit needs to be performed.
Can anyone really expect an institution that has
been as historically dishonest as the U.S. government to be able to police
itself and offer any sort of transparency?
Even the White House press corps is starting to
complain about the lack of transparency from the Obama regime and this is
coming from some of the most biased so-called journalists on the entire
planet. To top it all off this is happening while Obama boasts that he is
running the most transparent government in the history of the country.
This is a total lie, because honesty and
transparency from the U.S. government does not exist presently.
To put it mildly, this so-called audit is almost
as ridiculous as the
Queen of England inspecting the Bank of Englands gold
reserves a few months back. With bogus propaganda stunts like
these it is no wonder why Germany is now demanding physical delivery of
their gold from the FED and other central banks.
Unfortunately for Germany it is going to take
until the year 2020 for them to get roughly half of their gold.
Meanwhile
the Chinese are buying huge amounts of gold on the open market comparable to
what Germany is requesting and the Chinese are having no logistical
difficulties in obtaining immediate delivery.
If all of the gold reserves were fully accounted
for and no funny business was taking place, Germany should have been able to
receive their gold in a matter of months not years.
Theres not much else to say about this
so-called audit of the FEDs gold reserves.
It is total garbage on so many different levels
and shows once again that the U.S. government is afraid to conduct a true
independent audit of the gold reserves.
