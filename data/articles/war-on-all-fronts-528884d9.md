The Russian government has finally caught on that its political opposition
is being financed by the US taxpayer-funded
National Endowment for
Democracy and other CIA/State Department fronts in an attempt to
subvert the Russian government and install an American puppet state in the
geographically largest country on earth, the one country with a nuclear
arsenal sufficient to deter Washingtons aggression.
Just as earlier this year Egypt expelled hundreds of people associated with
foreign-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for instilling
dissent and meddling in domestic policies, the Russian Duma (parliament)
has just passed a law that Putin is expected to sign that requires political
organizations that receive foreign funding to register as foreign agents.
The law is based on the US law requiring the
registration of foreign agents.
Much of the Russian political opposition consists of foreign-paid agents,
and once the law passes leading elements of the Russian political opposition
will have to sign in with the Russian Ministry of Justice as foreign agents
of Washington.
The Itar-Tass News Agency reported on July 3
that there are about 1,000 organizations in Russia that are funded from
abroad and engaged in political activity. Try to imagine the outcry if the
Russians were funding 1,000 organizations in the US engaged in an effort to
turn America into a Russian puppet state. (In the US the Russians would find
a lot of competition from Israel.)
The Washington-funded Russian political opposition masquerades behind human
rights and says it works to open Russia.
What the disloyal and treasonous
Washington-funded Russian political opposition means by open Russia is
to open Russia for brainwashing by Western propaganda, to open Russia to
economic plunder by the West, and to open Russia to having its domestic and
foreign policies determined by Washington.
Non-governmental organizations are very
governmental.
They have played pivotal roles in both financing
and running the various color revolutions that have established American
puppet states in former constituent parts of the Soviet Empire.
NGOs have been called coup d'Ã©tat machines,
and they have served Washington well in this role.
They are currently working in Venezuela against
Chavez.
Of course, Washington is infuriated that its plans for achieving hegemony
over a country too dangerous to attack militarily have been derailed by
Russias awakening, after two decades, to the threat of being politically
subverted by Washington-financed NGOs. Washington requires foreign-funded
organizations to register as foreign agents (unless they are Israeli
funded).
However, this fact doesnt stop Washington from
denouncing the new Russian law as anti-democratic, police state,
blah-blah.
Caught with its hand in subversion, Washington
calls Putin names. The pity is that most of the brainwashed West will fall
for Washingtons lies, and we will hear more about gangster state Russia.
China is also in Washingtons crosshairs. Chinas rapid rise as an economic
power is perceived in Washington as a dire threat. China must be contained.
Obamas US Trade Representative has been secretly negotiating for the last 2
or 3 years a Trans Pacific Partnership, whose purpose is to derail Chinas
natural economic leadership in its own sphere of influence and replace it
with Washingtons leadership.
Washington is also pushing to form new military alliances in Asia and to
establish new military bases in,
-
the Philippines
-
South Korea
-
Thailand
-
Vietnam
-
Australia
-
New Zealand,
...and elsewhere.
Washington quickly inserted itself into disputes between China and Vietnam
and China and the Philippines.
Washington aligned with its former Vietnamese
enemy in Vietnams dispute with China over the resource rich Paracel and
Spratly islands and with the Philippines in its dispute with China over the
resource rich
Scarborough Shoal.
Thus, like Englands interference in the dispute between Poland and National
Socialist Germany over the return to Germany of German territories that were
given to Poland as World War I booty, Washington sets the stage for war.
China has been cooperative with Washington, because the offshoring of the US
economy to China was an important component in Chinas unprecedented high
rate of economic development. American capitalists got their short-run
profits, and China got the capital and technology to build an economy that
in another 2 or 3 years will have surpassed the sinking US economy.
Jobs offshoring, mistaken for free trade by free
market economists, has built China and destroyed America.
Washingtons growing interference in Chinese affairs has convinced Chinas
government that military countermeasures are required to neutralize
Washingtons announced intentions to build its military presence in Chinas
sphere of influence. Washingtons view is that only Washington, no one else,
has a sphere of influence, and Washingtons sphere of influence is the
entire world.
On July 14 Chinas official news agency, Xinhua, said that Washington was
interfering in Chinese affairs and making Chinas disputes with Vietnam and
the Philippines impossible to resolve.
It looks as if an over-confident US government is determined to have a
three-front war:
This would appear to be an ambitious agenda for
a government whose military was unable to occupy Iraq after nine years or to
defeat the lightly-armed Taliban after eleven years, and whose economy and
those of its NATO puppets are in trouble and decline with corresponding
rising internal unrest and loss of confidence in political leadership.
