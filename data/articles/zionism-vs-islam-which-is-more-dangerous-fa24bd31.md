Zionism vs. Islam.
Which is more dangerous?
So much focus has been placed upon radical Islamic terrorism
that Zionist deceit and crime is overlooked.

Zionism is a massively important piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding the forces that shape the world today.
It is a fundamental part of the drive towards global governance, a One World Government or a New World Order.
Yet, because of the widespread Zionist control of the MSM (Mainstream Media) and Western governments, its pervasive - and I mean pervasive - influence is cunningly cloaked.
These days, the Zionist MSM has successfully diverted attention away from its own crimes of theft and genocide against the Palestinians to put the spotlight on Islam, or rather, the migration of Arabian people and certain violent acts of an incredibly small percentage of such people.
Yet, watching the MSM news, listening to Trump and even reading a big portion of the Alternative Media, you would think that Islam is the biggest ever threat to Western civilization.
The point of this article is to dispel such a myth.
As you read this, please bear in mind that I have nothing against Judaism or Jews, I emphasize the distinction between Zionism and Judaism, I don't belong to any particular religion, and I believe is only fair to treat Islam like Christianity, Judaism or any other religion.
From one perspective, all religions (especially as opposed to spirituality) are bogged down in dogma and are a form of mind control. From another perceptive, all religions contain a core of truth which you can use to spiritually evolve.
It really depends on how you look at it.
I'm going to start with a point of commonality - the problems and faults of Islam that have people so concerned.
Islam, like any religion, has its shortcomings.
There are people who are nominally Muslim who use Islam as an excuse for theft, violence and war (as with other religions. In fact, Zionists themselves claim that "god gave them the right" to the land of Israel despite the fact that other people inconveniently happened to be living there when they took over by force in 1948).
Islam also has adherents who are extremists, who want to interpret everything literally and/or insist that only their clan's interpretation is the "correct" interpretation (does this sound familiar to any Christians and Jews out there?).
From this rigid and narrow line of thinking comes Sharia Law with all of its rules and laws that favor men over women, and make theft, adultery, heresy, blasphemy and apostasy punishable with whippings, amputations and death.
Additionally, there is a disturbing thread of pedophilia that runs through Islam, allegedly starting at the very top with the founder prophet Muhammad himself, who supposedly married a 6 year old girl and consummated that marriage when she was 9, although given that it was 1400 years ago, we cannot know for sure.
No doubt, these are shortcomings.
In the last year, with the mass migration of Arabs to Europe and the ensuing migrant rape crisis (especially in Sweden and Germany), people are rightfully worried.
It is troubling to hear some of these migrants boast about wanting to take over Europe and establish Sharia Law there. I wonder though - how many migrants really want to do that? After all, it's usually the loudest and most outrageous people that get the attention.
We must also remember why many of the migrants are there anyway. Is it because they want to take over Europe, because they want a better life or because the West (US, UK, France, Germany) bombed their countries with their kindhearted "humanitarian interventions" in the first place?
An important question to consider is this: are the people who criticize Islam judging the main religion of the West, Christianity, by the same standards?
After all, the Catholic Church has been a beacon of tyranny throughout the ages.
It has condemned, stolen, invaded, guilt-tripped, tortured and murdered literally millions of people throughout the ages - when it wasn't branding its enemies as heretics, native peoples as savages, and woman as witches in order to burn them at the stake.
These days, the Vatican is home to all sorts of orgies and scandals, the Catholic Church remains Pedophilia Central (including conducting child trafficking) and its priests and missionaries vaccinate third world women (e.g. in the Philippines and Africa) with surreptitious birth control as part of the NWO depopulation agenda.
Then, there are the Christian cults like Jehovah's Witnesses who teach there are just 144,000 places reserved in Heaven (so act now and reserve your place!) and who disown family members that refuse to stay in or join the church.
Yet, there are still those who get up on their high horse and condemn Islam in the light of "Western civilized values based on Christianity" all the while forgetting that there's nothing Islam is doing that hasn't already been done by Christianity.
Christianity has already done a great job of paving the way to Hell for us, thank you very much.
Of course, it's not fair to judge all Christians by the actions of the Catholic Church and other Christian churches or cults. Likewise, it's not fair to judge all Muslims by Islamic extremists. Islam is a massive religion of 1.6 billion.
Clearly, you can't judge something by what less than 1% of that thing, group, teaching, culture, nation or organization does or says. Yet people do.
So, yes, Islam has its faults.
However overall, Muslims are being used as pawns and scapegoats in a bigger agenda. Islamic terrorism is just a symptom, not the deeper cause or driver of the world's ills.
With that said, let's get a bit clearer about what is - and what is not - Islam.
First of all, why is everyone labeling the issue as "Islamic terrorism", "Islamic migration", etc. when what we're talking about is actually a group of people?
We're talking about Arabs...
To state the obvious, Arabs are people and Islam is a religion. Not all Arabs are Muslim! Furthermore, just as with Christianity and Judaism, some Arabs are Muslim in name only but do not actively practice their religion or espouse their faith.
It's important to be accurate with language if you want a clear understanding of a topic - but how many people are actually making this rather obvious distinction?
Is it Islamic terrorism?
Arabian terrorism?
Or perhaps Zio-Islamic terrorism?

Secondly, many of these so-called Islamic terrorist events are committed not by Muslims but by Arabs (there is more to the story here but I will get to that later).
These so-called Islamic terrorists are about as Islamic as a piece of pork.
Take Mohammad Atta for example, the supposed ringleader of the 9/11 false flag attack.
Did you know that he was found smoking, gambling, drinking alcohol, whoring and eating pork in the days leading up to 9/11? He might have a first name of Mohammad but there doesn't appear to be anything else remotely Muslim about this guy.
You can find a similar pattern with many of the false flag operations of the last few years which have been blamed on Arabian patsies.
As Kevin Barrett writes in his article, Gen. H.R. McMaster is right! There is no "radical Islamic terrorism", none of the terrorists who commit the attacks and bombings are truly Islamic:
"The new National Security Advisor, Gen. H.R. McMaster, seems an unusually sane appointment by Trump standards. McMaster has a reputation as one of those rare military folks who has been known to flout CYA protocol and tell difficult truths. During Thursday's National Security Council meeting, McMaster reportedly said, "that the label 'radical Islamic terrorism' was not helpful because terrorists are 'un-Islamic,' according to people who were in the meeting." McMaster is right. Islamic law clearly prohibits targeting innocent civilians. Additionally, FBI data shows that American "radically un-Islamic nominally Muslim terrorists" commit less terrorism than American Jews, leftists, and Hispanics. And polls show that Muslims oppose terrorism more than non-Muslims do."

Guess what?
FBI data shows that Islamic terrorism
is less common than Latino terrorism,
Jewish terrorism, Leftist terrorism and more.
But I thought all Muslims were evil and out to get us? Terrorist attacks on US land
by group, 1980 to 2005,
according to the FBI.
Thirdly, a group like ISIS, despite its name, does not represent Islam, any more than the Ku Klux Klan represents Christianity or the Mossad represents Judaism.
ISIS is a US-Israeli creation whose targets are 90% Muslim. Its savagery has nothing to do with real Islam.
It's the same case when any extremist or group of extremists hijack a religion and use it to justify whatever nefarious agenda they have. Killing in God's name.
The Crusades did that, as have many before them, as will many after them. ISIS is just the latest player.
Obviously, terrorism and murder go against the pure heart of any true religion. When you strip away the dogma of religion, you are (hopefully) left with a path whose mission is to help you find God or achieve self-realization (however you want to put it).
Judging, deceiving, lying, stealing and killing have nothing to do with any true religion.
People since time immemorial have always used religion to justify whatever acts they want to, even if those acts were despicable and contrary to the teachings of their religion.
That's the history of mankind.
Let us turn away from Islam and towards Zionism.
To begin with, Zionism is political philosophy that is separate from Judaism the religion.
Zionism is all about the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and some Jewish groups (as I wrote about in Jews Against Zionism) such as True Torah Jews and Neturei Karta believe Zionism is a bastardization of Judaism.
David Icke has done tremendous research on Zionism over the years, and he coined the term Rothschild Zionism to make it abundantly clear who is behind Zionism - the Rothschilds, the key NWO family who started the modern international banking scam that entraps people to this day.
The Rothschilds funded Zionism, were the recipients of the Balfour Declaration and essentially own Israel.
Zionism functions as a secret society. It dominates the US, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Canada and other Western powers, and has even infiltrated the UN to some degree.
It has a nefarious history to say the least.
It has been behind many key political events, assassinations and false flag operations of the last 50 years.
The article How Israel Out-Foxed US Presidents does a great job of summarizing how Zionism has influenced and controlled US presidents ever since the inception of Israel in 1948.
Meanwhile, here is my own brief list of Zionist crimes:
Zionists have continuously and illegally expanded Israel's territory by stealing land, eradicating villages and committing genocide against a sovereign people (the Palestinians) During the 1950s Cold War, Israel makes a secret arrangement with the UK and France and then invades the Suez Canal. The Soviets threaten to intervene on the side of Egypt. The US president Eisenhower, trying to avoid a US-Russia nuclear showdown, demands the Israeli-spearheaded invasion of Sinai be stopped. A ceasefire is declared, the British and French depart, but the Israelis drag their heels. Eisenhower gives then Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion an ultimatum (a threat to cut off all US aid). In March 1957 the Israelis finally withdraw Zionists have a hand in the JFK assassination, due to their dislike of Kennedy pushing them hard to disclose their secret nuclear program at Dimona Israel initiates attacks against both Egypt and Syria in the 6 Day War, where it captured territory such as the Golan Heights which it has not returned to this day. During this 6 Day War, Israel attacks the USS Liberty in 1967 (even though the US and Israel were supposed allies at the time) with unmarked aircraft Israel attacks Lebanon in 1982. Israel attempts to kill as many PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) fighters as possible. Israel uses its long-running trick of claiming that its attacks and offensive aggression are "defense". Then US president Reagan says, "When PLO sniper fire is followed by fourteen hours of Israeli bombardment that is stretching the definition of defensive action too far" Zionists are intimately involved in the planning and execution of the 9/11 false flag operation Israel consistently lies and exaggerates the threat of the Iranian nuclear intentions, while harboring a nuclear arsenal of its own, and refusing to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

Another important aspect to consider is that much of the Islamophobia is being generated by Zionist organizations to distract people away from their own crimes.
The Mossad motto is,
"By way of deception, thou shalt do war".
In so many ways, Israel is behind the invention and creation of radical Islam, Islamic terrorism, Islamophobia and the demonization of Islam.
It's behind the creation of the latest bogeyman group ISIS, including making and releasing fake footage of supposed beheadings via its front group SITE. If we're going to use the label Islamic terrorism, then Zio-Islamic terrorism is more accurate.
The war on terror is fake. The Pentagon was caught paying a British PR firm $540 million to make fraudulent Islamic terrorist videos. Israel framed 19 Arabs for the 9/11 hijacking.
Check out chapter 7 of Masters of Deception by Zander Fuerza, a chapter entitled The Myth of Osama bin Laden & the Nineteen Arab Oswalds:
"It is the Mossad's specialty to frame Arabs and Muslims for acts of terror that they commit themselves, just as it is generally the Jewish specialty to frame non-Jews for their own misdeeds and to fabricate the extent of non-Jewish persecution of Jews. As we learned earlier in this text, on 9/11 the Mossad tried to trick the NYPD into thinking Palestinians were going to bomb the Holland tunnel when in reality two Israelis attempted to explode a truck bomb on the George Washington Bridge. We also witnessed the Jewish-owned news media promulgate a fraudulent video clip purporting to show Palestinians celebrating the 9/11 attacks in the West Bank, when five Israelis were actually celebrating the attacks in New Jersey, right across the Hudson river! The myth of Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda has been used to hoodwink the American public into supporting the imperial schemes of Zionism."

He's referring to the incident that Trump got wrong:
the dancing Israelis celebrating the destruction of the WTC.
The brainwashing is so heavy that people can't even remember who the supposed terrorists are.
In the weeks after 911, evidence suggests it was Israel that framed Muslims in the anthrax murders. Israel's fingerprints were over the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks and the 2016 Brussels bombing which we were told was committed by 2 Arabs.
In so many of these cases, Israel controls the security before the event, and thus can dismantle cameras, weaken vigilance and order stand-downs to secretly orchestrate or allow the event to happen.
People are having the wool pulled over their eyes big time.
The Mossad have been framing Muslims and Arabs for decades, an age-old ploy to fool people into thinking Arabs are the perpetrators.
The article Israeli Terrorism and the Framing of Muslims has many examples of how the Israelis are doing this:
"Operation Trojan: Israel purposely manufactured false evidence of Arab terrorism tricking the US to go to war against an innocent nation The Israeli secret spy agency planted a transmitter in Tripoli Libya and then broadcast terrorist messages in Libyan code making Libya responsible for the killing of two Americans in the bombing of the La Belle discothèque in Germany. It was later proven that Libya had nothing to do with the bombing. By use of this fraud Israel induced the American bombing of Libya resulting in the death of countless civilians including the adopted infant daughter of its president Moammar Al-Qaddafi."
"Operation Trojan:

Other examples include fake IDs used by Mossad agents, the Israeli use of fake passports to implicate Arabs and the use of stolen or forged passports in Mossad terror operations.
Retired CIA agent Philip Geraldi also explains how Mossad officers have approached American Muslims in an effort to recruit them.
Israeli spying upon the US is the most aggressive of any US ally:
"There have been a number of cases reported to the FBI about Mossad officers who have approached leaders in Arab-American communities and have falsely represented themselves as 'U.S. intelligence'," Giraldi wrote recently in American Conservative magazine. "Because few Muslims would assist an Israeli, this is done to increase the likelihood that the target will cooperate. It's referred to as a 'false flag' operation."

We could be here for a very, very long time presenting all the evidence of Mossad framing Muslims and Arabs, Zio-Islamic terrorism and Zionist crimes.
If the evidence and examples in this article aren't enough for you, please go and conduct your own research. The proof is truly overwhelming and shows beyond all doubt that Zionism has been the driver of so much crime, theft, spying, murder, assassination and war since 1948.
Based on this, it is hardly controversial to say that, in Zionism vs Islam, Zionism is more dangerous than Islam to the West.
However, to stop there is not enough. Islam is a religion and Zionism is a political philosophy, but neither of them is the real enemy of freedom. They are both manifestations of a deeper force.
What kind of behavior drives the worst attitudes, behaviors and crimes committed by that using Islam as an excuse and by that which identifies with Zionism? What's behind the pedophilia, terrorism and war?
If we want to understand the New World Order, we need to see the thread of Satanism underpinning all of this. We need to understand the original distortion that caused all these symptoms, isms, religions and movements - and it can be found within each of us.
It is the work of each person to identify, integrate and heal it within himself or herself.
