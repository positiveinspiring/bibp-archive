I know many people have a great deal of
difficulty comprehending just how many wars are started for no other purpose
than to force private central banks onto nations, so let me share a few
examples, so that you understand why the US Government is mired in so many
wars against so many foreign nations.
There is ample precedent for this.
The United States fought the American Revolution
primarily over King George III's Currency Act, which forced the colonists to
conduct their business only using printed bank notes borrowed from the Bank
of England at interest.
After the revolution, the new United States
adopted a radically different economic system in which the government issued
its own value-based money, so that private banks like the Bank of England
were not siphoning off the wealth of the people through interest-bearing
bank notes.
"The refusal of King George 3rd to allow the
colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man
from the clutches of the money manipulators, was probably the prime
cause of the revolution."
Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father
But bankers are nothing if not dedicated to
their schemes to acquire your wealth, and know full well how easy it is to
corrupt a nation's leaders.
Just one year after
Mayer Amschel Rothschild had
uttered his infamous,
"Let me issue and control a nation's money
and I care not who makes the laws",
...the bankers succeeded in setting up a new
Private Central Bank called the First Bank of the United States, largely
through the efforts of the Rothschild's chief US supporter, Alexander
Hamilton.
Founded in 1791, by the end of its twenty year
charter the First Bank of the United States had almost ruined the nation's
economy, while enriching the bankers.
Congress refused to renew the charter
and signaled their intention to go back to a state issued value based
currency on which the people paid no interest at all to any banker.
This resulted in a threat from Nathan Mayer
Rothschild against the US Government,
"Either the application for renewal of the
charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a
most disastrous war."
Congress still refused to renew the charter for
the First Bank of the United States, whereupon Nathan Mayer Rothschild
railed,
"Teach those impudent Americans a lesson!
Bring them back to colonial status!"
Financed by
the Rothschild controlled Bank of
England, Britain then launched the war of 1812 to recolonize the United
States and force them back into the slavery of the Bank of England, or to
plunge the United States into so much debt they would be forced to accept a
new private central bank.
And the plan worked.
Even though the War of 1812
was won by the United States, Congress was forced to grant a new charter for
yet another private bank issuing the public currency as loans at interest,
the Second Bank of the United States.
Once again, private bankers were in
control of the nation's money supply and cared not who made the laws or how
many British and American soldiers had to die for it.
Once again the nation was plunged into debt,
unemployment, and poverty by the predations of the private central bank, and
in 1832 Andrew Jackson successfully campaigned for his second term as
President under the slogan, "Jackson And No Bank!"
True to his word, Jackson succeeds in blocking
the renewal of the charter for the Second Bank of the United States.
"Gentlemen!
I too have been a close observer
of the doings of the Bank of the United States. I have had men watching
you for a long time, and am convinced that you have used the funds of
the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country.
When you won, you divided the profits
amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me
that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall
ruin ten thousand families.
That may be true, gentlemen, but that is
your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families,
and that would be my sin!
You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have
determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, (bringing his fist down
on the table) I will rout you out!".
Andrew Jackson, shortly before ending the
charter of the Second Bank of the United States. From the original
minutes of the Philadelphia committee of citizens sent to meet with
President Jackson (February 1834), according to Andrew Jackson and the
Bank of the United States (1928) by Stan V. Henkels
Shortly after President Jackson (the only
American President to actually pay off the National Debt) ended the Second
Bank of the United States, there was an attempted assassination which failed
when both pistols used by the assassin, Richard Lawrence, failed to fire.
Lawrence later said that with Jackson dead,
"Money would be more plenty."
Of course, the public school system is as
subservient to the bankers' wishes to keep certain history from you, just as
the corporate media is subservient to
Monsanto's wishes to keep the dangers
of
GMOs from you, and
the global warming cult's wishes to conceal from you
that the Earth has actually been cooling for the last 16 years.
Thus is should come as little surprise that much
of the real reasons for the events of the Civil War are not well known to
the average American.
When the Confederacy seceded from the United
States, the bankers once again saw the opportunity for a rich harvest of
debt, and offered to fund Lincoln's efforts to bring the south back into the
union, but at 30% interest. Lincoln remarked that he would not free the
black man by enslaving the white man to the bankers and using his authority
as President, issued a new government currency, the greenback.
This was a direct threat to the wealth and power
of the central bankers, who quickly responded.
"If this mischievous financial policy, which
has its origin in North America, shall become endurated down to a
fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money without cost.
It will pay off debts and be without debt. It will have all the money
necessary to carry on its commerce.
It will become prosperous without precedent
in the history of the world. The brains, and wealth of all countries
will go to North America. That country must be destroyed or it will
destroy every monarchy on the globe."
The London Times responding to Lincoln's
decision to issue government Greenbacks to finance the Civil War, rather
than agree to private banker's loans at 30% interest
In 1872 New York bankers sent a letter to every
bank in the United States, urging them to fund newspapers that opposed
government-issued money (Lincoln's greenbacks).
"Dear Sir:
It is advisable to do all in your power to
sustain such prominent daily and weekly newspapers... as will oppose the
issuing of greenback paper money, and that you also withhold patronage
or favors from all applicants who are not willing to oppose the
Government issue of money.
Let the Government issue the coin and the
banks issue the paper money of the country...
[T]o restore to circulation the Government
issue of money, will be to provide the people with money, and will
therefore seriously affect your individual profit as bankers and
lenders."
Triumphant plutocracy; the story of American
public life from 1870 to 1920, by Lynn Wheeler
"It will not do to allow the greenback, as
it is called, to circulate as money any length of time, as we
cannot control that."
Triumphant plutocracy; the story of American
public life from 1870 to 1920, by Lynn Wheeler
"Slavery is likely to be abolished by the
war power, and chattel slavery destroyed. This, I and my European
friends are in favor of, forslavery is but the owning of labor and
carries with it the care for the laborer, while the European plan, led
on by England, is for capital to control labor by controlling the
wages.
THIS CAN BE DONE BY CONTROLLING THE MONEY."
Triumphant plutocracy; the story of American
public life from 1870 to 1920, by Lynn Wheeler
Goaded by the private bankers, much of Europe
supported the Confederacy against the Union, with the expectation that
victory over Lincoln would mean the end of the Greenback.
France and Britain
considered an outright attack on the United States to aid the confederacy,
but were held at bay by Russia, which had just ended the serfdom system and
had a state central bank similar to the system the United States had been
founded on. Left free of European intervention, the Union won the war, and
Lincoln announced his intention to go on issuing greenbacks.
Following
Lincoln's assassination, the Greenbacks were pulled from circulation and the
American people forced to go back to an economy based on bank notes borrowed
at interest from the private bankers.
Finally, in 1913, the Private Central Bankers of
Europe, in particular the Rothschilds of Great Britain and the Warburgs of
Germany, met with their American financial collaborators on Jekyll Island,
Georgia to form a new banking cartel with the express purpose of forming the
Third Bank of the United States, with the aim of placing complete control of
the United States money supply once again under the control of private
bankers.
Owing to hostility over the previous banks, the name was changed to
"The Federal Reserve" system in order to grant the new bank a
quasi-governmental image, but in fact it is a privately owned bank, no more
"Federal" than Federal Express.
Indeed, in 2012,
the Federal Reserve
successfully rebuffed a Freedom of Information Lawsuit by Bloomberg News on
the grounds that as a private banking corporation and not actually a part of
the government, the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to the
operations of the Federal Reserve.
1913 proved to be a transformative year
for the nation's economy, first with the passage of the 16th "income tax"
Amendment and the
false claim that it had been ratified.
"I think if you were to go back and and try
to find and review the ratification of the 16th amendment, which was the
internal revenue, the income tax, I think if you went back and examined
that carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never
ratified that amendment."
U.S. District Court Judge James C. Fox,
Sullivan Vs. United States, 2003.
Later that same year, and apparently unwilling
to risk another questionable amendment, Congress passed the Federal Reserve
Act over Christmas holiday 1913, while members of Congress opposed to the
measure were at home.
This was a very underhanded deal, as the Constitution
explicitly vests Congress with the authority to issue the public currency,
does not authorize its delegation, and thus should have required a new
Amendment to transfer that authority to a private bank. But pass it Congress
did, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it as he promised the bankers he
would in exchange for generous campaign contributions.
Wilson later
regretted that decision.
"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly
ruined my country. A great industrial nation is now controlled by its
system of credit.
We are no longer a government by free opinion, no
longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a
government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."
Woodrow Wilson 1919
The next year, World War One started, and it is
important to remember that prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve,
there was no such thing as a world war.
World War One started between Austria-Hungary
and Serbia, but quickly shifted to focus on Germany, whose industrial
capacity was seen as an economic threat to Great Britain, who saw the
decline of the British Pound as a result of too much emphasis on financial
activity to the neglect of agriculture, industrial development, and
infrastructure (not unlike the present day United States).
Although pre-war
Germany had a private central bank, it was heavily restricted and inflation
kept to reasonable levels. Under government control, investment was
guaranteed to internal economic development, and Germany was seen as a major
power. So, in the media of the day, Germany was portrayed as the prime
opponent of World War One, and not just defeated, but its industrial base
flattened.
Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was ordered to pay
the war costs of all the participating nations, even though Germany had not
actually started the war.
This amounted to three times the value of all of
Germany itself. Germany's private central bank, to whom Germany had gone
deeply into debt to pay the costs of the war, broke free of government
control, and massive inflation followed (mostly triggered by currency
speculators), permanently trapping the German people in endless debt.
When the Weimar Republic collapsed economically,
it opened the door for the National Socialists to take power.
Their first
financial move was to issue their own state currency which was not borrowed
from private central bankers. Freed from having to pay interest on the money
in circulation, Germany blossomed and quickly began to rebuild its industry.
The media called it "The German Miracle".
TIME magazine lionized Hitler for
the amazing improvement in life for the German people and the explosion of
German industry, and even named him TIME Magazine's Man Of The Year in 1938.
Once again, Germany's industrial output became a
threat to Great Britain.
"Should Germany merchandise (do
business) again in the next 50 years we have led this war (WW1) in
vain."
Winston Churchill in The Times (1919)
"We will force this war upon Hitler, if he wants it or not."
Winston Churchill (1936 broadcast)
"Germany becomes too powerful. We have to crush it."
Winston
Churchill (November 1936 speaking to US - General Robert E.
Wood)
"This war is an English war and its goal is the destruction of Germany."
Winston Churchill (- Autumn 1939
broadcast)
Germany's state-issued value based currency was
also a direct threat to the wealth and power of the private central banks,
and as early as 1933 they started to organize a global boycott against
Germany to strangle this upstart ruler who thought he could break free of
private central bankers!
As had been the case in World War One, Great
Britain and other nations threatened by Germany's economic power looked for
an excuse to go to war, and as public anger in Germany grew over the
boycott, Hitler foolishly gave them that excuse.
Years later, in a spirit of
candor, the real reasons for that war were made clear.
"The war wasn't only about abolishing
fascism, but to conquer sales markets. We could have, if we had intended
so, prevented this war from breaking out without doing one shot, but we
didn't want to."
Winston Churchill to Truman (Fultun, USA March
1946)
"Germany's unforgivable crime before
WW2 was its attempt to loosen its economy out of the world trade system
and to build up an independent exchange system from which the
world-finance couldn't profit anymore... We butchered the wrong pig."
Winston Churchill (The Second World War -
Bern, 1960)
As a side note, we need to step back before WW2
and recall Marine Major General Smedley Butler.
In 1933,
Wall Street bankers
and financiers had bankrolled the successful coups by both Hitler and
Mussolini. Brown Brothers Harriman in New York was financing Hitler right up
to the day war was declared with Germany.
And they decided that a fascist
dictatorship in the United States based on the one on Italy would be far
better for their business interests than Roosevelt's "New Deal" which
threatened massive wealth re-distribution to recapitalize the working and
middle class of America.
So the Wall Street tycoons recruited General Butler
to lead the
overthrow of the US Government and install a "Secretary of General
Affairs" who would be answerable to Wall Street and not the people, would
crush social unrest and shut down all labor unions.
General Butler pretended
to go along with the scheme but then exposed the plot to Congress. Congress,
then as now in the pocket of the Wall Street bankers, refused to act.
When
Roosevelt learned of the planned coup he demanded the arrest of the
plotters, but the plotters simply reminded Roosevelt that if any one of them
were sent to prison, their friends on Wall Street would deliberately collapse
the still-fragile economy and blame Roosevelt for it.
Roosevelt was thus
unable to act until the start of WW2, at which time he prosecuted many of
the plotters under the Trading With The Enemy act.
The Congressional minutes
into the coup were finally released in 1967 and became the inspiration for
the movie, "Seven Days in May" but with the true financial villains erased
from the script.
"I spent 33 years and four months in active
military service as a member of our country's most agile military force
- the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from second
lieutenant to Major General.
And during that period I spent more of my
time being a high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street
and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for
capitalism.
I suspected I was just a part of a racket at the time. Now
I am sure of it. Like all members of the military profession I never had
an original thought until I left the service. My mental faculties
remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of the
higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.
Thus
I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil
interests in 1914.
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the
National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping
of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall
Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua
for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-12.
I
brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in
1916. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that the Standard Oil went its
way unmolested. During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room
would say, a swell racket. I was rewarded with honors, medals and
promotion.
Looking back on it, I feel I might have given Al Capone a few
hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three city
districts. I operated on three continents."
General Smedley Butler,
former US Marine Corps Commandant,1935
As President, John F. Kennedy understood the
predatory nature of private central banking.
He understood why Andrew
Jackson fought so hard to end the Second Bank of the United States. So
Kennedy wrote and signed
Executive Order 11110 which ordered the US Treasury
to issue a new public currency, the United States Note.
Kennedy's United States Notes were not borrowed
form the Federal Reserve but created by the US Government and backed by the
silver stockpiles held by the US Government.
It represented a return to the
system of economics the United States had been founded on, and was perfectly
legal for Kennedy to do. All told, some four and one half billion dollars
went into public circulation, eroding interest payments to the Federal
Reserve and loosening their control over the nation.
Five months later John
F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas Texas, and the United States Notes
pulled from circulation and destroyed (except for samples held by
collectors).
John J. McCloy, President of the Chase Manhattan Bank, and
President of the World Bank, was named to the Warren Commission, presumably
to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were
concealed from the public.
As we enter the eleventh year of what future
history will most certainly describe as World War Three, we need to examine
the financial dimensions behind the wars.
Towards the end of World War Two, when it became
obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war
environment, the major world economic powers met at Bretton Woods, a luxury
resort in New Hampshire in July of 1944, and hammered out the Bretton Woods
agreement for international finance.
The British Pound lost its position as
the global trade and reserve currency to the US dollar (part of the price
demanded by Roosevelt in exchange for the US entry into the war). Absent the
economic advantages of being the world's "go-to" currency, Britain was
forced to nationalize the Bank of England in 1946.
The
Bretton Woods
agreement, ratified in 1945, in addition to making the dollar the global
reserve and trade currency, obligated the signatory nations to tie their
currencies to the dollar.
The nations that ratified Bretton Woods did so on
two conditions.
The first was that the Federal Reserve would refrain from
over-printing the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from
other nations in exchange for ink and paper; basically an imperial tax.
That
assurance was backed up by the second requirement, which was that the US
dollar would always be convertible to gold at $35 per ounce.
Of course,
the Federal Reserve, being a
private
bank and not answerable to the US Government, did start overprinting paper
dollars, and much of the perceived prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s was the
result of foreign nations' obligations to accept the paper notes as being
worth gold at the rate of $35 an ounce.
Then in 1970, France looked at the
huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults, for which real French
products like wine and cheese had been traded, and notified the United
States government that they would exercise their option under Bretton Woods
to return the paper notes for gold at the $35 per ounce exchange rate.
Of
course, the United States had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper
notes, so on August 15th, 1971, Richard Nixon "temporarily" suspended the
gold convertibility of the US Federal Reserve Notes.
This "Nixon shock"
effectively ended Bretton Woods and many global currencies started to delink
from the US dollar. Worse, since the United States had collateralized their
loans with the nation's gold reserves, it quickly became apparent that the
US Government did not in fact have enough gold to cover the outstanding
debts.
Foreign nations began to get very nervous about their loans to the US
and understandably were reluctant to loan any additional money to the United
States without some form of collateral.
So Richard Nixon started the
environmental movement, with the EPA
and its various programs such as
"wilderness zones", Roadless areas", Heritage rivers", "Wetlands", all of
which took vast areas of public lands and made them off limits to the
American people who were technically the owners of those lands.
But Nixon
had little concern for the environment and the real purpose of this land
grab under the guise of the environment was to pledge those pristine lands
and their vast mineral resources as collateral on the national debt.
The
plethora of different programs was simply to conceal the true scale of how
much American land was being pledged to foreign lenders as collateral on the
government's debts; eventually almost 25% of the nation itself.
With open lands for collateral already in short supply,
the US Government embarked on a new program to shore up sagging
international demand for the dollar.
The United States approached the
world's oil producing nations, mostly in the Middle East, and offered them a
deal.
In exchange for only selling their oil for dollars, the United States
would guarantee the military safety of those oil-rich nations.
The oil rich
nations would agree to spend and invest their US paper dollars inside the
United States, in particular in US Treasury Bonds, redeemable through future
generations of US taxpayers.
The concept was labeled the "petrodollar".
In
effect, the US, no longer able to back the dollar with gold, was now backing
it with oil. Other peoples' oil. And that necessity to keep control over
those oil nations to prop up the dollar has shaped America's foreign policy
in the region ever since.
But as America's manufacturing and agriculture has
declined, the oil producing nations faced a dilemma. Those piles of US
Federal Reserve notes were not able to purchase much from the United States
because the United States had little (other than real estate) anyone wanted
to buy. Europe's cars and aircraft were superior and less costly, while
experiments with GMO food crops led to nations refusing to buy US food
exports.
Israel's constant belligerence against its neighbors caused them to
wonder if the US could actually keep their end of the petrodollar
arrangement.
Oil producing nations started to talk of selling their oil for
whatever currency the purchasers chose to use. Iraq, already hostile to the
United States following Desert Storm, demanded the right to sell their oil
for Euros in 2000 and in 2002,
the United Nations agreed to allow it under
the "Oil for food" program instituted following Desert Storm.
One year later
the United States re-invaded Iraq, lynched Saddam Hussein, and placed Iraq's
oil back on the world market only for US dollars.
The clear US policy shift
following 9-11, away from being
an impartial broker of peace in the Mideast to one of unquestioned support
for Israel's aggressions only further eroded confidence in the Petrodollar
deal and even more oil producing nations started openly talking of oil trade
for other global currencies.
Over in Libya, Muammar Gaddafi had instituted a
state-owned central bank and a value based trade currency, the Gold Dinar.
Gaddafi announced that Libya's oil was for sale, but only for the Gold
Dinar.
Other African nations, seeing the rise of the Gold Dinar and the
Euro, even as the US dollar continued its inflation-driven decline, flocked
to the new Libyan currency for trade. This move had the potential to
seriously undermine the global hegemony of the dollar.
French President
Nicolas Sarkozy
reportedly went so far as to call Libya,
a threat to the financial
security of the world.
So, the United States
invaded Libya, brutally
murdered Qaddafi (the object lesson of Saddam's lynching not being enough
of a message, apparently), imposed a private central bank, and returned
Libya's oil output to dollars only.
The gold that was to have been made into
the Gold Dinars is, as of last report, unaccounted for.
According to General Wesley Clark, the master plan for
the "dollarification" of the world's oil nations included seven targets,
Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran (Venezuela, which
dared to sell their oil to China for the Yuan, is a late addition).
What is
notable about the original seven nations originally targeted by the US is
that none of them are members of the
Bank for International Settlements, the
private central bankers private central bank, located in Switzerland. This
meant that these nations were deciding for themselves how to run their
nations' economies, rather than submit to the international private banks.
Now the bankers' gun sights are on Iran, which dares to
have a government central bank and sell their oil for whatever currency they
choose. The war agenda is, as always, to force Iran's oil to be sold only
for dollars and to force them to accept a privately owned central bank.
The German government recently
asked for the return of
some of their gold bullion from the Bank of France and the New York Federal
Reserve. France has said it will take 5 years to return Germany's gold. The
United States has said they will need 8 years to return Germany's gold.
This
suggests strongly that the Bank of France and the NY Federal Reserve have
used the deposited gold for other purposes, and they are scrambling to find
new gold to cover the shortfall and prevent a gold run.
So it is inevitable
that
suddenly France invades Mali, ostensibly to combat Al Qaeda, with the
US joining in. Mali just happens to be one of the world's largest gold
producers with gold accounting for 80% of Mali exports.
War for the bankers
does not get more obvious than that!
You have been raised by a public school system and media
that constantly assures you that the reasons for all these wars and
assassinations are many and varied.
The US claims to bring democracy to the
conquered lands, butthey haven't; the usual result of a US overthrow is the
imposition of a dictatorship, such as,
-
the 1953 CIA overthrow of Iran's
democratically elected government of
Mohammad Mosaddegh and the imposition of the Shah
-
the 1973 CIA
overthrow of Chile's democratically elected government of President
Salvador Allende, and the imposition of
Augusto Pinochet
-
to save a people from a cruel oppressor
-
revenge
for 9-11
-
the tired worn-out catch all excuse for invasion,
'weapons of
mass destruction'
Assassinations are always passed off as "crazed lone nuts"
to obscure the real agenda.
The real agenda is simple. It is enslavement of the
people by creation of a false sense of obligation. That obligation is false
because the Private Central Banking system, by design, always creates more
debt than money with which to pay that debt.
Private Central Banking is not
science, it is a religion; a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the
priesthood, meaning the owners of the Private Central Bank. The fraud
persists, with often lethal results, because the people are tricked into
believing that this is the way life is supposed to be and no alternative
exists or should be dreamt of.
The same was true of two earlier systems of
enslavement,
-
Rule by Divine Right
-
Slavery,
...both systems built to trick
people into obedience, and both now recognized by modern civilization as
illegitimate.
Now we are entering a time in human history where we will
recognize that rule by debt, or rule by Private Central Bankers issuing the
public currency as a loan at interest, is equally illegitimate.
It only
works as long as people allow themselves to believe that this is the way
life is supposed to be.
But understand this above all,
Private Central Banks do
not exist to serve the people, the community, or the nation.
Private Central
Banks exist to serve their owners, to make them rich beyond the dreams of
Midas and all for the cost of ink, paper, and the right bribe to the right
official.
Behind all these wars, all these assassinations, the
hundred million horrible deaths from all the wars lies a single policy of
dictatorship.
The private central bankers allow rulers to rule only on the
condition that the people of a nation be enslaved to the private central
banks. Failing that, said ruler will be killed, and their nation invaded by
those other nations enslaved to private central banks.
The so-called "clash of civilizations" we read about on
the corporate media is really a war between banking systems, with the
private central bankers forcing themselves onto the rest of the world, no
matter how many millions must die for it.
Indeed the constant hatemongering
against Muslims lies in a simple fact.
Like the ancient Christians (prior to
the Knights Templars private banking system), Muslims forbid usury, or the
lending of money at interest.
And that is the reason our government and
media insist they must be killed or converted.
They refuse to submit to
currencies issued at interest. They refuse to be debt slaves.
So off to war your children must go, to spill their blood
for the money-junkies' gold. We barely survived the last two world wars. In
the nuclear/bioweapon age, are the private central bankers willing to risk
incinerating the whole planet just to feed their greed?
Apparently so.
And as we
continue our tour of dead worlds, we come to this one,
which the former inhabitants called "Earth", which is
kind of weird because when it was still alive, the surface
was mostly water. Go figure.
Anyway,
near as we can tell, they burned their own world to a
crisp because of a religious war over some god named 'Dol-Arh'.
But
happily, there was no intelligent life on that planet,
so
no real loss.
Know what
I mean?
Flag waving and propaganda aside, all modern wars are
wars
by and for the private bankers, fought and bled for by third parties
unaware of the true reason they are expected to gracefully be killed and
crippled for.
The process is quite simple.
As soon as the Private Central
Bank issues its currency as a loan at interest, the public is forced deeper
and deeper into debt.
When the people are reluctant to borrow any more, that
is when the Keynesian economists demand the government borrow more to keep
the pyramid scheme working.
When both the people and government refuse to
borrow any more, that is when wars are started, to plunge everyone even
deeper into debt to pay for the war, then after the war to borrow more to
rebuild.
When the war is over, the people have about the same as they did
before the war, except the graveyards are far larger and everyone is in debt
to the private bankers for the next century.
This is why
Brown Brothers Harriman
in New York was funding the rise of Adolf Hitler.
As long as Private Central Banks are allowed to exist,
inevitably as the night follows day there will be poverty, hopelessness, and
millions of deaths in endless World Wars, until the Earth itself is

Those who control the debt, control everything.
