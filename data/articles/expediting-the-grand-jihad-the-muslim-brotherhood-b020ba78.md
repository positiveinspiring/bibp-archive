Part One
Barack Obama and The Muslim Brotherhood
January 11, 2008
As these authors
write these words, Israel is conducting a major ground assault in the Gaza
Strip. Israeli ground troops and heavy armor have moved deep into the Gaza
Strip ("Israeli forces split Gaza in two" - see below 'Sources
Cited' ).
According to the BBC, the move has, in effect,
cut the territory in two (ibid).

This ground assault followed hot on the heels of
Operation Cast Lead, a December 27-28 series of Israeli airstrikes conducted
in Gaza in response to Hamas' refusal to renew the truce brokered by Egypt
in the summer of 2008 (Khalil, "The already-strained Hamas-Egypt
relationship sours").
Hamas had been launching rocket attacks into Israel
since December 24, when no less than 70 rockets hit the small Jewish state,
and Israel decided to strike back ("Israeli jets hit Hamas target, killing
1").
Doubtless, the conflict between Israel and Hamas is one of the many issues
that Obama will have to address when he enters the Oval Office. Is the
President-elect sincere in his opposition to the terrorists responsible for
the current Middle East crisis? Obama has repeatedly condemned Hamas,
calling the group a terrorist organization (Oinounou, "A Hamas problem for
Obama?")
The President-elect even went as far as to
condemn former President Jimmy Carter for meeting with Hamas (ibid). But the
words of Ahmed Yousef, a top Hamas political advisor, during a WABC
interview, seem to suggest that Obama's opposition to Hamas may be a mere
public relations ploy.
During the interview, Yousef stated:
"We don't mind-actually we like Mr. Obama.
We hope he will (win) the election and I do believe he is like John
Kennedy, great man with great principle, and he has a vision to change
America to make it in a position to lead the world community but not
with domination and arrogance." (Ibid)
Why would Hamas support an Obama presidency? The
answer may lie in a group known as the Muslim Brotherhood.
The Muslim Brotherhood
Hassan al-Banna
According to former CIA operative Robert Baer,
Hamas was an offshoot of the Egyptian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood
(172).
Founded in 1928 by an Egyptian schoolteacher named Hassan al-Banna
with the expressed purpose of purifying Islam, the Muslim Brotherhood is
anything but a benign Muslim organization (172).
According to Baer, the Brotherhood "is another
of the cauldrons from which al Qaeda emerged" (172).
Khalid Sheik Mohammed,
the architect of the September 11 attacks, joined the Muslim Brotherhood at
the age of sixteen and attended the Brotherhood's desert youth camps (Mintz
and Farah, "In Search of Friends Among Foes").
Ayman Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy, was a
member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Egyptian branch (ibid). According to
Seymour Hersh, the Brotherhood may have even been involved in the September
11 attacks. Hersh states:
"Many of the September 11th hijackers had operated
out of cells in Aachen and Hamburg, where Al Qaeda was working with the
Brotherhood"
("The Syrian Bet").
The Brotherhood's hatred of the United States
was clearly expressed in a 1991 internal memorandum written by Mohamed Akram
for the
Entitled "An Explanatory
Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North
America," the document states that the Brotherhood's activities in the
United States represent:
a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and
destroying the Western civilization from within and "sabotaging" its
miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it
is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious over all other
religions.
(Akram)
Akram's memorandum failed to mention the
powerful, white, English-speaking individuals that have given assistance to
the Brotherhood's "grand Jihad."
The Muslim Brotherhood is not only a
radical and dangerous party; it is intimately tied to the power elite.
This connection probably had its start prior to
World War Two when British travel writer and intelligence agent Freya Stark
forged an alliance between the Brotherhood and British intelligence (Dorril
622). Brotherhood collaboration with Western intelligence continued with an
alliance between the Brotherhood and the CIA that began around 1955.
According to former CIA agent Miles Copeland, it
was around this time that America began looking for the Muslim equivalent of
Billy Graham, hoping to use such a charismatic individual to influence the
Arab world. When this failed, the Agency began forging ties with the Muslim
Brotherhood (Aburish 60-61).
The connection between the Brotherhood and the power elite is perfectly
illustrated by the party's audience with the Bush Administration.
On June
20, 2007, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department
hosted a meeting with other intelligence community representatives to
discuss the opening of "more formal channels" to the Muslim Brotherhood
(Lake, "Bush Weighs Reaching Out to 'Brothers'").
One of the Brotherhood supporters at the June 20
meeting was Robert Leiken (ibid).
Robert Leiken, a scholar at the Nixon
Center, was commissioned by the National Intelligence Council to put
together a paper on the history of the Muslim Brotherhood earlier in 2007
(ibid).
According to administration officials, Leiken's paper to the
National Intelligence Council drew the attention of Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice and senior members of the National Security Council (ibid).
George W. Bush even encouraged
Tariq al-Hashemi,
the leader of the Iraq branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, to form an alliance
to oppose Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki (Slavin, "Iraqi VP says Bush wants
coalition to counter al-Sadr").
After his election victory,
Barack Obama promised that change was on the
way. Will that change include an end to Washington's contact with the Muslim
Brotherhood?
Unfortunately, there is evidence that the
Brotherhood will maintain its audience with Washington circles during the Obama reign.
The Democrats' Answer to
Grover Norquist
Mazen Asbahi
When the Obama campaign needed an individual to
reach out to the Muslim community, it turned to Chicago lawyer Mazen Asbahi
for help (Simpson and Chozick, "Obama's Muslim-Outreach Adviser Resigns").
But Asbahi's connections to the Muslim
Brotherhood did more to raise questions than it did to bridge gaps. By
August of 2008, Asbahi had resigned from his position as volunteer
coordinator for Muslim American affairs for the Obama campaign (ibid).
Asbahi was the democrats' equivalent of GOP/Bush political operative Grover
Norquist, meant to court Muslim American voters. And like Norquist, Asbahi
had several radical associations that raised eyebrows and set off alarm
bells.
Eight years before taking up the Obama cause, Asbahi served on the
Board of the Allied Asset Advisors (Spencer, "Obama's Muslim Outreach
Problem").
Allied Asset Advisors is a subsidiary of the
North American Islamic Trust (NAIT) (ibid).
According to the 1991 internal
memorandum authored by Akram for the Muslim Brotherhood, NAIT is part of the
network conducting the Brotherhood's "grand jihad" ("An Explanatory
Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North
America").
NAIT is also connected to the Holy Land
Foundation (HLF), an organization believed to be involved in the financing
of Muslim Brotherhood offshoot Hamas (Josh Gerstein, "US: Facts Tie Muslim
Groups To Hamas Front Case").
According to the prosecutors in the HLF case,
NAIT has an,
"intimate relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood"
(ibid)
When the Wall Street Journal and other media organs began raising questions,
Asbahi quickly went to work on damage control.
The Chicago lawyer claimed he
resigned from Allied Asset Advisors' board immediately after learning about
fellow board member Jamal Said's connection to Hamas (Simpson and Chozick, "Obama's
Muslim-Outreach Adviser Resigns").
However, Asbahi later admitted that his
resignation from the Obama campaign was purely a "strategic decision,"
suggesting that the explanation for his involvement in the Allied Asset
Advisors was contrived (Spencer, "Obama's Muslim Outreach Problem").
Asbahi's alibi further disintegrated on September 15, 2008 when the former
Muslim liaison met with members of the Council on American-Islamic Relations
(CAIR) (ibid).
CAIR's parent organization, the Islamic
Association for Palestine, is named in Akram's Muslim Brotherhood memorandum
as part of the Brotherhood's "grand jihad" network (ibid). Asbahi's
resignation did not end the Obama campaign's love affair with the Muslim
Brotherhood.
Also present at the September 15, 2008 meeting
was Asbahi's replacement as the Obama campaign's Muslim liaison, Minha
Husaini (ibid).
Rezko, Othman, and Al Taqwa
Antoin "Tony" Rezko
Obama may also connect to the Muslim Brotherhood
through his old Chicago mob friends.
Antoin "Tony" Rezko, a Syrian-American political
fundraiser and Chicago real estate developer provides the bridge. On June 4,
2008, Rezko was found guilty in federal court on 16 corruption charges ("Rezko
begins serving time immediately").
It seems that when Rezko wasn't busy
helping his friends in the Illinois political scene, such as
scandal-embroiled Governor Rod Blagojevich and Obama, he was knee-deep in a
kickback scheme that involved taking bribes from companies that desired
state contracts (ibid).
Obama owes a lot to his good friend Tony. Rezko began his career as Obama's
political godfather in 1995, when two of his food companies contributed
$2,000 to Obama's campaign (Novak, "Obama and his Rezko ties").
It was the
beginning of a beautiful political friendship. Rezko helped bankroll Obama
in five election runs (Fusco, et al., "Obama explains Rezko relationship to
Sun-Times").
After some ducking and weaving, Obama admitted
to receiving $250,000 from Rezko's fundraising efforts (ibid).
According to
the Chicago Sun-Times, this amount was,
"about $100,000 more than had
previously been disclosed and about five times more than Obama conveyed
during a November 2006 question-and-answer exchange with the Sun-Times"
(ibid)
Talat Othman
Standing behind Rezko is Talat Othman, a leader
in the American Muslim community in Illinois and an extremely successful
Arab American businessman.
It was Othman who introduced Rezko to former
Illinois governor Jim Edgar and it was Othman who aided Rezko in gaining
access to Illinois political circles (Hanania, "Arabs in Chicago discover
political clout and controversy").
Rezko was also recognized as "Entrepreneur of
the Decade" by Othman's Arab-American Business and Professional Association
(ibid).
Othman has a close relationship with M. Yaqub
Mirza, a naturalized Pakistani businessman and physicist (Trento 336). Othman and Mirza were co-chairmen of the
Islamic
Society of North America 2001 Convention (336).
M. Yaqub Mirza
The two were also involved
in Amana Mutual Funds Trust, an Islamic mutual fund which, according to
investigative journalist Joseph Trento,
"specializes in investments that are
consonant with Islamic beliefs"
(336)
Othman sits on Amana's board and Mirza served as the mutual fund's chairman (336).
On March 20, 2002 a U.S. Treasury task force known as Green Quest raided 14
homes and businesses believed to be involved in terrorism financing that
were affiliated with Mirza (Guidera and Simpson, "Agents Raid Properties
Affiliated with Chairman of Islamic Fund").
According to Guidera and Simpson, the Green
Quest investigators were "most interested in Mr. Mirza's role as an officer
in the Saar Foundation, a nonprofit started in the 1970s by members of the
Saudi Arabia's al-Rajihi family, which has interest in banking,
construction, and real estate" (ibid).
Stephen Schwartz identifies the Saar
Foundation as the "keystone" to the Mirza-related network ("Wahhabis in the
Old Dominion").
The hidden hand of the Muslim Brotherhood can be identified through the Saar
Foundation's connection with a shell company known as Al-Taqwa (Schwartz, "Wahhabis
in the Old Dominion").
The Al-Taqwa shell game was originally based in
Switzerland and had as one of its leading figures a notorious Nazi disciple
named Ahmed Huber (ibid).
It was an extensive network that included
companies based in the Bahamas, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein (Hosenball,
"Attacking the Money Machine").
Al Taqwa even had a foothold in the United
States until after September 11 when its assets were frozen and its
operations were shut down by a U.S. presidential order ("Wahhabis in the Old
Dominion"). According to a Newsweek investigation, the Al Taqwa network "was
set up in the 1980s by prominent members of the Muslim Brotherhood"
("Attacking the Money Machine").
Al-Taqwa' chairman, Youssef Nada, even admitted
to being a member of the Brotherhood for 50 years (ibid).
Apparently, the Green Quest raids made Othman
extremely nervous.
Two weeks after the raids, Othman and several
other Muslim activists met with Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill to
protest the raids (Trento 337).
Was Othman afraid that the investigation
would connect him to the Muslim Brotherhood's plan for a "grand jihad"? Four
individuals who were targets of the investigation were affiliated with
Amana, the mutual fund where Othman serves as a trustee (337).
It is also interesting to note that another
Amana board member, Samir Salah, is known to have ran a Caribbean branch of
the Muslim Brotherhood's Al-Taqwa network ("Wahhabis in the Old Dominion").
When Obama tries to downplay his connections to Rezko, is he merely trying
to conceal his poor judgment in the realm of campaign finance?
The 44th President may be trying to hide a much
more disturbing reality from the eyes of the public. That reality is the
fact that our own government, in league with
the power elite, will continue
collaborating with America's enemies.
The "grand Jihad" proclaimed by Akram
in his 1991 memorandum does not only constitute the Muslim Brotherhood's
crusade to destroy Western civilization. It also constitutes the power elites's war on
the plebeians.
Iran
Obama's Muslim Brotherhood connections may motivate him to go soft on Hamas
when it comes time for him to deal with the current Middle East crisis.
The
Muslim Brotherhood is still very close to its Hamas offshoot. If the new
administration was too supportive of Israel in its efforts to end the
terrorist attacks, it could potentially alienate its Muslim Brotherhood
connections.
Those connections may prove useful when the new
administration unveils its
plans for Iran.
According to investigative researcher Webster Tarpley, power in Washington
has shifted away from the neocon "rogue" faction of the elite to
the
Trilateral faction that stands behind Obama ("US Policy Shift On Iran-Iraq
Again Shows Brzezinski Rules In Washington").
This faction seeks to redirect
the American Empire's hostilities away from Iran and focus them on Russia
and China (ibid).
Such a plan requires that Iran be transformed into an
asset, which means that Tehran's efforts to procure nuclear weapons may even
be tolerated, so long as Iran is willing to act as a nuclear proxy of the
American Empire (ibid).
Iran has long desired to revive the Persian Empire,
and Trilateralists such as Carter's former National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski believe that they can insure that a revived Persian
Empire is merely an extension of the American Empire.
For Obama, diplomacy really means imperial recruitment.
The Muslim
Brotherhood could provide the bridge in the recruitment process. According
to Robert Baer, Iran has substantial ties with Jordan's branch of the Muslim
Brotherhood, known as the Islamic Action Front (178).
Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood offshoot currently
fighting with Israel, is also extremely close to Iran.
Iran first began
establishing contact with Hamas in 1992, when Israel expelled 415 members of
Hamas's leadership as punishment for their involvement in the first intifada,
which was a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule (172).
When the exiled leaders crossed the border into
Jordan, they found Hezbollah, a Shi'a paramilitary organization that acts as
Iran's Lebanese proxy, waiting for them with open arms (172).
Hezbollah
provided the Hamas leaders with tents, clothes, and food (172-173). A few
days later, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard officer also arrived on the scene
to provide assistance to the Hamas leaders (173).
Without a doubt, the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran
are becoming extremely close as Iran attempts to co-opt every major movement
and political party in the region as part of its bid for empire.
The Obama administration may wish to use its connection to the Muslim
Brotherhood as a means of establishing diplomatic channels with Iran.
But
that means the new President may not be as supportive of Israel in its
struggle with Hamas. Obama may even pressure Israel to come to the table of
diplomacy and establish yet another truce with Hamas.
The 1988 Hamas Covenant, however, painfully
illustrates why peace overtures on Israel's part would be an act of folly.
Article seven of the covenant states:
"The Day of Judgment will not come about
until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide
behind stones and trees.
The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O
Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad
tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is
one of the trees of the Jews."
("Hamas Covenant 1988")
Article 28 reiterates the document's anti-Jewish
theme when it states:
"Israel, Judaism, and Jews challenge Islam and Muslim
people. 'May the cowards never sleep.'"
("Hamas Covenant 1988")
Obviously,
the idea of Israel establishing a truce with a group that adheres to such
ideas is unthinkable.
It would merely give Hamas an opportunity to lick its
wounds and continue to prepare for the day when it hopes to finally wipe
Israel from the face of the earth.
These authors believe that history will characterize the Obama
administration's attempts at diplomacy with Iran as a lost opportunity. Iran
has been a hotbed of radicalism ever since the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
Instead of facilitating Iran's departure from radicalism, Obama and his
puppeteers will work to turn the radicals against the American Empire's
competitors, such as Russia and China.
A chance to move Iran in a moderate direction
will slip away as Obama and his Establishment handlers try to employ the
country as an asset in their fight for dominance in the
New World Order.
In the process, Obama will help expedite the
Brotherhood's "grand Jihad."

Part Two
Engaging the Muslim Brotherhood
Jan. 19, 2008
Inauguration - The
Beast Enters the Gates
For many, the January 20 Presidential inauguration of Barack Obama is reason
for celebration.
Obama supporters everywhere believe that the event
represents the introduction of the solution to America's deepening crisis. It would break not a few hearts, however, if it
was revealed that the enemies of America are going to be in attendance.
According to a January 14 Associated Press article, a prayer will be offered
at the inauguration by Ingrid Mattson, the first woman president of
America's largest Muslim group, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)
(Zoll, "Muslim woman, rabbis to pray at inaugural service").
While many Americans may believe that this
prayer offering represents a celebration of religious pluralism, the hidden
message behind this display, which is only discernible to the power elite
and the most astute observer, is that members of the Establishment will
continue their torrent love affair with the Muslim Brotherhood.
The first
installment of this series established the Muslim Brotherhood as a dangerous
organization that is partially responsible for spawning al Qaeda.
Furthermore, the Brotherhood has a long running,
symbiotic relationship with the power elite and the darker factions of the
United States government and the intelligence community.
ISNA's connection to the Muslim Brotherhood was revealed during the 2007
Holy Land Foundation (HLF) trial. Before being shut down by the United
States government, the HLF was the largest Islamic charity in America.
In 2001, evidence began to surface that HLF was
a fundraising entity for Hamas, a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot. One of HLF's
founders, Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, was even a Hamas political leader.
This lead to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control
classifying HLF as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist ("Specially
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons").
During the HLF trial, ISNA was named as an
unindicted co-conspirator that was,
"intimately connected with the HLF and
its assigned task of providing financial support to Hamas"
(Gerstein, "U.S.:
Facts Tie Muslim Groups To Hamas Front Case")
The prosecution also
introduced several exhibits into evidence that established ISNA's "intimate
relationship" with the Muslim Brotherhood (ibid).
In a 1991 internal document written by Mohamed Akram for the
Shura Council of the Muslim Brotherhood, HLF appears on a list
of Brotherhood "friends" (Akram).
The Muslim Brotherhood is anything but Muslim.
The party, which is
considered the world's largest and oldest Islamist group, is actually a cult
of neo-Gnostic
immanentists. The Brotherhood re-conceptualizes the concept
of jihad, which actually connotes a personal struggle, as an object of
immanent experience. Thus, the spiritual conflict of orthodox Islam is
transplanted within the ontological plane of the physical universe.
Such an ontological transplantation is a
defining feature of all sociopolitical Utopianism, as is evidenced by the
myriad of earthly paradises envisioned by revolutionaries throughout
history.
While the concept of a worldly Heaven circulated under numerous
appellations, it was always portrayed as a future that would be instantiated
through the efforts of man himself. Historically, such immanentist crusades
have resulted in wars, terrorism, and genocide.
For instance, the immanentist crusade of Hitlerian fascism attempted to establish a Third
Reich through eugenical regimentation.
Their ideological kissing cousins, the
communists, sought to establish the worker's paradise through the bloody
revolution of Marxist dialectic.
Neoconservatives, which are the progenies
of Trotskyism, have attempted to establish a Pax Americana through the
violent imperialism of the so-called "global democratic revolution."
In the case of immanentist Muslims, factions
like the Sufi Sunnis and Ismaili Shiites wage a jihad within the ontological
confines of the visible world in hopes of achieving a universal submission
to their perverted version of Islam.
Some immanentist Muslims even believe
in an immanent parousia, as is evidenced by the disturbing messianic claims
of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Given its neo-Gnostic eschatology, the Muslim
Brotherhood is merely another incarnation of the immanentist crusade.
The 1991 internal document written by Mohamed Akram for the Shura Council of
the Muslim Brotherhood demonstrates the organization's immanentist
interpretation of jihad.
Entitled "An Explanatory Memorandum on the
General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America," the
document states that the Brotherhood's activities in the United States
represent,
"a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and
destroying the Western civilization from within and 'sabotaging' its
miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it
is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious over all other
religions"
(Akram)
The Muslim Brotherhood is deadly serious about
their neo-Gnostic crusade.
In "Ikhwan in America," a document over the
Muslim Brotherhood that was released during the HLF trial, Brotherhood
members are alleged to have traveled to camps where they engaged in weapons
training, which the Brotherhood euphemistically refers to as "Special Work"
("Ikhwan in America").
The document also describes a Brotherhood method
known as "Securing the Group," which amounts to little more than
counterintelligence operations against the U.S. government (ibid).
The inauguration will not be the first time that Mattson has had an audience
with the democratic wing of the Establishment.
The ISNA president also spoke
during the Interfaith Gathering at the 2008 Democratic National Convention
("Democratic Convention To Highlight Diverse Community of Faith Leaders
Working Toward Common Good"). Before the new administration, the Bush White
House also had contact with the Brotherhood and its allies.
What happened to Obama's promise of change?
When it comes to maintaining contact with
America's enemies, it seems that Obama's pledge is null and void.
The U.S.-Muslim Engagement
Project and the Muslim Brotherhood
Mattson is also a member of the U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project's Leadership
Group ("U.S-Muslim Engagement Project: Leadership Group On U.S. Muslim
Engagement").
While this organization claims to be creating and advocating a
bipartisan strategy of improving relations between the U.S. and Muslim
world, the real goal seems to be legitimizing the Muslim Brotherhood and
other organizations involved in the neo-Gnostic "grand Jihad."
In a document entitled "Changing Course
- A New
Direction for U.S. Relations with The Muslim World," the U.S.-Muslim
Engagement Project promotes the U.S. government forging official ties with
the Brotherhood.
The document states:
The U.S. must also consider when and how to
talk with political movements that have substantial public support and
have renounced violence, but are outlawed or restricted by authoritarian
governments allied to the U.S.
The Muslim Brotherhood parties in Egypt
and Jordan are arguably in this category.
("Changing Course: A New Direction for
U.S. Relations with the Muslim World")
In order to convince the U.S. government to
establish formal channels with the Brotherhood, the party's image must be
cleaned up considerably.
The U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project is not ignorant
of this fact. "Changing Course" presents the Brotherhood as an organization
that has abandoned violence and is pursuing more peaceful forms of political
expression.
The document elaborates:
After a period of violent opposition to the
Egyptian government, the Brotherhood has moderated some of its goals and
strategies as its candidates have been able to participate, tacitly in
parliamentary elections.
Other independent Islamist political parties
have also begun to organize and compete, but the government continues to
limit electoral competition.
Given this context, the primary institution
goal for the U.S. in Egypt should be to create opportunities for
political participation and good governance at the local and national
level.
(ibid)
"Changing Course" also suggests that the United
States' hesitance to fully engage in diplomacy with the Brotherhood bespeaks
a frivolity that pervades America's attitude towards the liberalization of
Islamic nations:
The U.S. has also sent mixed signals about its willingness to work with
nonviolent Islamist parties, notably the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and
Jordan.
This inconsistency reflects a belief shared
among many policy makers that there are significant trade-offs between U.S.
security interests and our commitment to political reform.
Though
understandable, these U.S. responses to militants and nonviolent Islamist
parties have confirmed the view of many Muslim citizens and mainstream
reformers that the U.S. is not serious about political liberalization in
Muslim countries.
(ibid)
Following these prescriptions would require the United States to abandon
sound national security precautions.
But placing Americans at risk does not seem to
concern the U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project.
Enter Dennis Ross and
the Neocons
The U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project is in a position to influence Obama.
Dennis Ross, the former Middle East peace envoy under George H.W. Bush and
Bill Clinton, provides the conduit. Ross is a member of the Leadership Group
of the U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project ("U.S.-Muslim Engagement Project:
Leadership Group On U.S. Muslim Engagement").
According to an Associated Press report,
incoming secretary of state Hillary Clinton will most likely appoint Ross as
a special advisor for the Middle East and Iran ("Incoming secretary of state
Clinton to name Dennis Ross as top advisor on Mideast, Iran").
If Ross takes
the job, he will be in a position to foster closer ties between the U.S.
government and the Muslim Brotherhood.
The already existing connection between the
Brotherhood and the darker factions of our government and intelligence
community may become an official and formal relationship that is no longer
frowned upon.
If this unholy alliance gains legitimacy, the Muslim Brotherhood may become
a weapon for those hawks and neoconservatives that survived the purge that
accompanied the election of Obama. Ross is a neoconservative.
Two documents
confirm this contention.
-
In the first document, entitled "Statement on
Post-War Iraq," Ross joined with other neoconservatives in support of
military intervention in Iraq.
-
In the second document, entitled "Second
Statement on Post-War Iraq," Ross and his fellow neoconservatives supported
then British Prime Minister Tony Blair's call for a closer partnership
between America and Europe.
Both
documents are part of the
Project for the New American Century, a
neoconservative plan, and Ross is a signatory on both.
The first installment of this series established that the election of Obama
represented a major power shift in Washington away from the neoconservative
faction of the power elite towards the Trilateral clique.
This shift was accompanied by a dramatic
decrease in the likelihood of an invasion of Iran because the trilateralists
favor recruiting Iran as an asset of the American Empire.
Neoconservative
operatives in the new administration such as Ross, however, may be able to
revive neoconservative plans to
invade Iran.
Ross has even helped prepare a document that proposes invasion as a viable
option to dealing with Iran's attempts to procure nuclear weapons. Entitled
"Meeting the Challenge
- U.S. Policy Toward Iranian Nuclear Development," the
document is the product of a bipartisan policy group and names Ross as a
contributor ("Meeting the Challenge: U.S. Policy Toward Iranian Nuclear
Development").
"Meeting the Challenge" states that there is a
"military component" to "deterrence and containment" (ibid). The report
suggests that the U.S. government "consider a declaration of automaticity"
(ibid).
This declaration would state:
"In the event Iran or any suspect proxy
utilizes nuclear weapons, Iran will be hit with a devastating
retaliatory strike"
(ibid)
A "devastating retaliatory strike" may even
employ nuclear weapons.
The report states:
A nuclear deterrent strategy would require
moving to a declared U.S. stance threatening the potential use of
nuclear weapons should Iran ever use a nuclear weapon or allow its
proxies to do so.
(ibid)
The report goes on to reiterate this "nuclear
deterrent strategy" theme:
The U.S. Administration may need to announce
that it reserves the right to respond to any attack against itself or
its allies with overwhelming force and, perhaps, nuclear weapons.
(ibid)
America must be ready to make good on its
threats and "must begin to prepare for such a response" (ibid).
This means that the U.S. must,
"construct
alliances needed to station U.S. forces in position to confront Iran"
(ibid)
Gulf Cooperation Council states such as Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, and Oman would be called upon to U.S. military forces to use
key military facilities that America has access to under defense pacts
formed after the 1991 Gulf War (ibid).
But the U.S. must also seek,
"enhanced access to military facilities in
countries East, West and North of Iran"
(ibid)
Overtures must be made toward states such as
Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, and Pakistan in order,
"to gain their approval to host the U.S.
forces and support the staff needed for military action"
(ibid)
If the neoconservatives are able to sway the new
president, invasion may be back on the table as a viable option. In such an
event, the government may look to the Muslim Brotherhood to use its
considerable influence and political clout in the Middle East to help build
the alliance needed to make an invasion successful.
The United States might have to use the
religious differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran. The
Brotherhood is a Sunni organization while Shia Islam is the dominant
religion of Iran. These differences could possibly motivate the Brotherhood
to work towards a consensus among other Arab states concerning an invasion
of Iran.
But the task may not be as easy as it sounds.
In its bid to become a
regional superpower, Iran has begun working past its religious differences
with the Brotherhood in order to forge significant ties with the highly
influential political movement. In 1992, Iran and Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah,
began building the bridge by giving sanctuary to 415 leaders of Hamas, the
Muslim Brotherhood's offshoot in the Palestinian Gaza Strip (Baer 172-173).
Iran has also forged considerable ties with the
Islamic Action Front, the Muslim Brotherhood's branch in Jordan (178).
Whatever the outcome of such efforts, one thing is apparent: the government,
acting on behalf of various factions of the power elite, is now courting
America's enemies. Such treason is intolerable, but will remain a permanent
fixture of the Establishment that currently dominates the American political
landscape.
Only a restoration of the Constitution will
change this sorry state of affairs.
