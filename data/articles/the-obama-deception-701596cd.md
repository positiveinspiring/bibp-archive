The Obama Deception is a hard-hitting
film that completely destroys the myth that Barack Obama is working
for the best interests of the American people. The Obama phenomenon is a
hoax carefully crafted by the captains of the
New
World Order.
He is being pushed as savior in an attempt to
con the American people into accepting global slavery. We have reached a
critical juncture in the New World Order's plans. and only by exposing the
con can we help to save freedom in America. The Obama Deception is not about
Left or Right: it's about a One World Government.
The
international banks plan to loot the people of the United States
and turn them into slaves on a Global Plantation.
Covered in this film: who Obama works for, what
lies he has told, and his real agenda, and how his initial appointments and
actions prove he serves the corporate oligarchs, not the American people.
If you want to know the facts and cut through
all the hype, this is the film for you.
