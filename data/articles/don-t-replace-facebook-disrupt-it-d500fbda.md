# Don't Replace Facebook - Disrupt It!

Facebook's real motivation is
more likely a combination
of implementing soft-censorship and an effort to
monetize news feeds by forcing content makers to pay in
order to access people already following them.
What's left
is wealthy content makers like large corporate media outfits
monopolizing the public's attention whether the public wants
it or not.
News feed has also been used in
at least two involuntary social engineering experiments
where the news feeds of users were manipulated without their
knowledge to influence them psychologically. In the most
recently exposed experiment,
Facebook manipulated the news feed of some 2 million
Americans in 2012 in order to increase public
participation during that year's US presidential election.
We show, via a massive (N =
689,003) experiment on Facebook, that emotional states can
be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading
people to experience the same emotions without their
awareness.
We provide experimental evidence that emotional
contagion occurs without direct interaction between people
(exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient),
and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.
Not only are
the findings troubling - illustrating that Facebook
possesses the ability to influence the emotions of its users
unwittingly through careful manipulation of their news feeds
- but the invasive, unethical methods by which Facebook
conducted the experiment are troubling as well.
Those involved in the experiment
were neither notified before nor after the experiment was
conducted, and along with news feed manipulation during the
2012 election, it appears Facebook sees the news feed
feature in terms of influencing people as Facebook and its
clients see fit rather than the feature being used to inform
users as they themselves see fit.
What Facebook is essentially is a massive, global, digital
"Skinner box."
Also known as a operant conditioning chamber, a
Skinner box conditions a subject - usually an animal - to
perform certain behaviors by controlling positive and negative
stimuli regulated within the box. Pressing the correct lever
would provide, for example, food pellets, while pressing the
wrong lever would provide a painful electric shock.
Facebook, in this way, admits it regulated positive and negative
stimuli in its 2013 experiment and in 2012 manipulated the
behavior of subjects also through the use of specifically
formulated stimuli.
There is no telling what other experiments
or ongoing manipulations Facebook users might be subjected to,
and whether or not other IT monopolies like Google are using
similar means to influence, manipulate, and condition the
behavior of users.
Disrupting Facebook
The first thing many Facebook users look for upon learning of
this are alternatives.
One in particular,
Ello, grabbed headlines recently as a "Facebook killer."
Should Facebook's 1 billion plus user base migrate over to Ello,
would there be anything to stop special interests from simply
co-opting and corrupting its basic premise of not manipulating
users or invading their privacy? Most likely not.
Instead, efforts to disrupt Facebook and the centralized social
networking premise it represents should be made.
In other words,
decentralizing social networking so that no single network
controls the information, rules, and regulations that define
social networking in general.
On
a global scale this is already being done.
Nations like Russia,
China, Iran, and others have produced their own indigenous
versions of Facebook - separate from not only Facebook's
monopoly, but the intrusive, abusive exploitation of that
monopoly by corporate-financier interests on Wall Street and in
the City of London.
Russia's
VK.com
for example, boasts 120 million users around the world and
within Russia itself, is the most popular social networking
site, by far eclipsing Facebook's market share.
While the
Western media criticizes VK as a tool of the Kremlin, in light
of recent scandals exposed in the West, the same could be said
of Wall Street and London's use of Facebook.
But decentralizing Facebook's grip on social networking to a
national scale isn't enough.
While many may find affinity toward
the current political order in Russia, some day that may no
longer be the case.
Further decentralization - in fact -
infinite decentralization should be the ultimate goal.
Forums,
Websites, and RSS Analogies
Web
forums are numerous and in many ways micro social networks in
and of themselves.
They are built around interests in
entertainment, skills and hobbies, commerce, political ideology,
religion, and many other personal interests. While one must
become a member of these forums to participate, anyone can
search the Internet and find threads containing useful
information.
It would be difficult to find the "Facebook" of
Internet forums - because while there are very large and
well-known forums - there is no monopoly.
Creating a new social networking paradigm based along a similar
notion of infinite decentralization is not only possible, it is
inevitable - just as soon as programmers and developers stop
trying to create the next "Facebook" and begin contemplating
instead the next paradigm shift in social networking altogether
- one that satisfies the growing desire to escape monopolized
networks with proclivities toward invading the privacy of its
users as well as manipulating and influencing them through
insidious social engineering.
Imagine open source tools like
Wiki or
WordPress that allows
anyone to create their own social network based around any
specific interest or series of interests.
Imagine tools like
RSS
feed that allows users from one social network to follow user
updates on another social network without actually joining that
network.
Imagine being able to take your information and import
it into a new social network if for whatever reason you decided
you no longer like the rules, regulations, and practices of the
network you were currently in - tools like WordPress' import
options that allow Blogger users to migrate over along with all
their previous Blogger content.
What will come next? Another
Facebook or something that will shift the paradigm of social
networking entirely?
Centralized networks are prone to abuse.
Even networks like Ello that initially show promise hold the
same weakness of over-centralization which will undoubtedly be
targeted by special interests.
A decentralized social networking
paradigm with tools used to mesh networks together as users
desire could represent just such a shift.
Facebook and undoubtedly VK and other large social networks have
various groups of disenfranchised users who are unable to use
these networks as they truly desire.
Facebook has faced
criticism for demanding users to use their real names to create
profiles. Minority groups that prefer anonymity could create
their own social network to cater specifically to their
interests and agenda.
They could follow popular feeds from other
social networks, but preserve their own community created by,
for, and of themselves.
In this way, instead of simply trying to replace Facebook with
the next soon-to-be co-opted, corrupted, and overbearing social
networking monopoly, the entire paradigm will be shifted in
favor of what users actually want - privacy, the ability to
control what content they receive, and to associate with whom
they want, how they want.
With hundreds if not thousands of
these interconnected but ultimately independent networks
cropping up, it will be impossible for monopolistic interests to
co-opt, control, or censor them all, or even a majority of them.
