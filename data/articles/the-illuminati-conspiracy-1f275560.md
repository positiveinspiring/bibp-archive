The
Illuminati Conspiracy
(Excerpt given in 1976, published
in Revelations of Awareness newsletter 84-2)
The money manipulation force
This Awareness indicates that the
money-changers by whatever name,
their force of darkness, which had controlled
the economies of nations; this money manipulation force which moved from Atlantis
through Egypt, Jerusalem, Israel, Babylonia, Rome,
Greece, the European nations,
the United States and Russia, and now has moved into the Orient; this force
of economic control which did create the wars in Europe between France, Spain,
England, Germany, Russia, --all of these in their time,-- this force which created
colonialism, which manipulated the rise and fall of power in nations; this
force which caused the assassination of Robert and John Kennedy, behind the
assassination of Marthin Luther King, behind the suffering of thousands of
entities, of millions of entities; this force behind the Vietnam war and now
operates behind all of these smaller wars in various countries; this force
which set up the Communistic revolution in Russia, all financed and manipulated
by the international banking system operated through the Rothschilds, through
the Rockefellers, who themselves were set up by the Rothschilds for a base
in the United States; these forces and these powers who passed their information
from one generation to another, who train their followers into levels of deception,
fraud and the use of power against the masses of humanity: these forces
are now engaged in the ultimate goal which entities throughout history have
hoped to experience wherein an entity glimpses the possibility to become king
of the world, and sets out to conquer the world.
This Awareness indicates in the past
the opportunities for this were never so great as they are now. This Awareness
indicates that these few hidden entities, (the number being 13); these 13
entities having influence over the rest of the world. Through their followers,
through their families, through their interrelationship with other families
in marriage and in economic ties, these entities are now moving frantically
to bring about a world government. This to begin by creating a crisis which
is intended to collapse the government of the United States as it has been
known, is intended to destroy the Constitution and replace it with
another,
is intended to destroy the Bill of
Rights.
This Awareness indicates these entities
seeking more and more power are moving rapidly and almost unhindered in their
movement toward world dictatorship. This Awareness suggests, that you take
a lesson from the oriental arts rather than attempt to resist the movement
of world government, but that you take this energy and hurl it further than
the bankers even anticipated. That you begin pushing rapidly for world government
based on concepts similar to those of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of
Rights, guaranteed within that Constitution along with other rights: The right
of freedom of morality so long as that morality does not harm another;
and freedom of economic well-being,--this as freedom of economic livelihood,
whereby food, shelter, clothing is provided regardless of what they do to
earn such; that anything more may be added according to their inclination
and ambition to seek such and work for such.
This Awareness indicates that this
also include in this new world government of all money systems into levels
of election whereby no private individual shall own any banking systems, or
shall own the offices of financial controls, wherein all financial offices,
all persons involved in banking and finances, be elected by the population
in the same manner that a congress person is elected. This Awareness indicates
that the banks be owned by the people as a form of service for the masses.
The money system to be part of the action of the people.
The failure
in the American system
This Awareness indicates the number-one
error, the great fault which was left open, that spot in the apple which spoiled
the batch, was that action of the founding Fathers wherein they allowed the
European Banking System to creep into the economics of the American colonies.
This is that which has led to the failure in the American system. This Awareness
indicates that this is the key to freedom on economic levels upon this plane.
Wherein entities can select their
leader and bankers, where entities have control over the judicial, legislative,
administrative, and monetary levels and have the religious freedoms and the
freedom of education, freedom to select their own type of education and freedom
of speech and communication, --these are the keys which shall bring the freedom
of this plane which shall eliminate all wars, which shall eliminate all tragedies
and suffering of the past that have been brought about by these money systems
and these entities using power and control and manipulation through the economics
and controls of these money changers.
This Awareness suggests that entities
begin immediately on all levels, particularly those who can voice this information,
to push for World Government based on the freedoms guaranteed as in the American
Constitution along with those indicated in this reading. This Awareness suggests
that a World Constitution be drawn up using these principles and this to be
submitted to the U.N., to all nations within the U.N. for their edification.
This Awareness suggests this action as taking that which would be the apparent
energy of evil and pushing this with such a speed and such intensity that
it goes beyond the bankers anticipation into realms of clarity.
This Awareness suggests this information
be sent to all New Age groups and to all who are open to receive this information.
That this to be duplicates, be passed on, especially be sent to various members
of congress and to wealthy entities. This Awareness indicates the super-rich
are the most fearful of those who are close to their level in terms of wealth.
That the upper class is the greatest threat to the super-rich and the international
banking powers; that these entities do indeed need to be given this information
for they would be the most responsive with this information. This Awareness
suggests this also be given to entities of political and diplomatic responsibility
in other nations who would relate unto U.N. activities of this nature.
