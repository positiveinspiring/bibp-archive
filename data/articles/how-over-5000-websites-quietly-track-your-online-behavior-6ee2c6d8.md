Researchers from Princeton University (PU) and
KU Leuven University (KULU) released a study (The
Web Never Forgets - Persistent Tracking Mechanisms in the Wild) on canvas
fingerprinting (CF)
provided by
AddThis which is the ability to instruct a
web browser,
"to draw a unique identifier and then log
your online behavior, is nearly impossible to detect, does not fall
under do not track voluntary systems and evades most conventional
ad-blocking software."
CF tells web browsers "to draw a hidden image,
and each computer produces a slightly different, unique image" that will
follow each individual user online as they travel from website to website.
This technique was invented by AddThis two years
ago.
Shockingly, 5% of the biggest websites on the
internet already use CF, including:
-
The White House Blog
-
WhiteHouse.gov
-
Starbucks
-
Perez Hilton
-
PlentyOFish
-
Rap Genius
-
CBS
-
Re/Max Canada
-
Metro
-
Home Hardware
-
Postmedia
-
YouPorn
-
Ontario University Application Center
-
Rogers TV station City News
-
Transcontinentals Canadian Living

Casey Oppenheim, co-founder of
Disconnect said:
"There is an entire invisible ecosystem that
is reliant on my data. My very personal information about what Im
browsing for, searching for, is being combined with real-world
information about where I work, who Im friends with.
People are creating very detailed profiles,
not just for advertising but also for employers and also for insurance
companies."
Rich Harris, chief executive officer for AddThis
commented:
"The data were being used for "internal
research and development. It had not been uniquely identifying enough
and the test will end soon."
CF is present on an estimated 5,542 of the top
100,000 on the internet thanks to AddThis and 20 other corporations who
offer a similar product to CF.
User tracking is common among web browsers that
use advertising such as Googles Double Click which allows website owners to
earn money from tracking visitors.
Gunes Acar, lead researcher and
student with the department of Computer Security and Industrial Cyrptography
at KULU, stated:
"Whats scary about this is it takes the
control away from the users. In Europe, it is kind of our right to have
a controllable browsing experience. This is a way to circumvent user
preferences."
It is claimed that most AddThis clients are
unaware of the tracking technology.
Another feature to this monitoring software is
that when the opt-out is chosen, the tracking is still happening while
AddThis maintains that the information collected is "not being used".
Acar asserts:
"Fingerprints can create legitimate
services. Using it for ads is a heavy-handed approach. It is a little
shady. Google I think they would not dare; I think they would try to
stick to more conventional methods."
