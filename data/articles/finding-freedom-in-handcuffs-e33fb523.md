Editors note: Truthdig
columnist Chris Hedges, an activist, an author and a member of a reporting
team that won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize, wrote this article after he was
released from custody following his arrest last Thursday. He and about 15
other participants in the Occupy Wall Street movement were detained as they
protested outside the global headquarters of Goldman Sachs in lower
Manhattan.
Faces appeared to me moments before the New York
City police arrested us Thursday in front of
Goldman Sachs.
They were not the faces of the smug Goldman
Sachs employees, who peered at us through the revolving glass doors and
lobby windows, a pathetic collection of middle-aged fraternity and sorority
members.
They were not the faces of the blue-uniformed police with their dangling
cords of white and black plastic handcuffs, or the thuggish Goldman Sachs
security personnel, whose buzz cuts and dead eyes reminded me of the East
German secret police, the Stasi.
They were not the faces of the demonstrators
around me, the ones with massive student debts and no jobs, the ones whose
broken dreams weigh them down like a cross, the ones whose anger and
betrayal triggered the street demonstrations and occupations for justice.
They were not the faces of the onlookers - the
construction workers, who seemed cheered by the march on Goldman Sachs, or
the suited businessmen who did not. They were faraway faces. They were the
faces of children dying.
They were tiny, confused, bewildered faces I had
seen in the southern Sudan, Gaza and the slums of Brazzaville, Nairobi,
Cairo and Delhi and the wars I covered. They were faces with large, glassy
eyes, above bloated bellies. They were the small faces of children convulsed
by the ravages of starvation and disease.
I carry these faces. They do not leave me. I look at my own children and cannot forget
them, these other children who never had a chance.
War brings with it a host
of horrors, including famine, but the worst is always the human detritus
that war and famine leave behind, the small, frail bodies whose tangled
limbs and vacant eyes condemn us all.
The wealthy and the powerful, the ones behind
the glass at Goldman Sachs, laughed and snapped pictures of us as if we were
a brief and odd lunchtime diversion from commodities trading, from hoarding
and profit, from this collective sickness of money worship, as if we were
creatures in a cage, which in fact we soon were.
A glass tower filled with people carefully selected for the polish and
self-assurance that come with having been formed in institutions of
privilege, whose primary attributes are a lack of consciousness, a penchant
for deception and an incapacity for empathy or remorse.
The curious onlookers behind the windows and we,
arms locked in a circle on the concrete outside, did not speak the same
language.
Profit. Globalization. War. National security.
These are the words they use to justify the snuffing out of tiny lives, acts
of radical evil.
Goldman Sachs commodities index is the most
heavily traded in the world. Those who trade it have, by buying up and
hoarding commodities futures, doubled and tripled the costs of wheat, rice
and corn. Hundreds of millions of poor across the globe are going hungry to
feed this mania for profit.
The technical jargon, learned in business
schools and on trading floors, effectively mask the reality of what is
happening - murder. These are words designed to make systems operate, even
systems of death, with a cold neutrality.
Peace, love and all sane affirmative speech in
temples like Goldman Sachs are, as
W.H. Auden understood,
soiled, profaned, debased to a horrid
mechanical screech.
We seemed to have lost, at least until the
advent of the
Occupy Wall Street movement, not only all personal
responsibility but all capacity for personal judgment.
Corporate culture absolves all of
responsibility. This is part of its appeal. It relieves all from moral
choice. There is an unequivocal acceptance of ruling principles such as
unregulated capitalism and globalization as a kind of natural law. The
steady march of corporate capitalism requires a passive acceptance of new
laws and demolished regulations, of bailouts in the trillions of dollars and
the systematic looting of public funds, of lies and deceit.
The corporate culture, epitomized by Goldman
Sachs, has seeped into our classrooms, our newsrooms, our entertainment
systems and our consciousness. This corporate culture has stripped us of the
right to express ourselves outside of the narrowly accepted confines of the
established political order. It has turned us into compliant consumers.
We are forced to surrender our voice.
These corporate machines, like fraternities and
sororities, also haze new recruits in company rituals, force them to adopt
an unrelenting cheerfulness, a childish optimism and obsequiousness to
authority. These corporate rituals, bolstered by retreats and training
seminars, by grueling days that sometimes end with initiates curled up under
their desks to sleep, ensure that only the most morally supine remain.
The strong and independent are weeded out early
so only the unquestioning advance upward. Corporate culture serves a
faceless system.
It is, as
Hannah Arendt writes,
the rule of nobody and for this very reason
perhaps the least human and most cruel form of rulership.
Our political class, and its courtiers on the
airwaves, insists that if we refuse to comply, if we step outside of the
Democratic Party, if we rebel, we will make things worse.
This game of accepting the lesser evil enables
the steady erosion of justice and corporate plundering. It enables
corporations to harvest the nation and finally the global economy,
reconfiguring the world into neofeudalism, one of masters and serfs. This
game goes on until there is hardly any action carried out by
the power elite
that is not a crime.
It goes on until corporate predators, who long
ago decided the nation and the planet were not worth salvaging, seize the
last drops of wealth.
It goes on until moral acts, such as calling for
those inside the corporate headquarters of Goldman Sachs to be tried, see
you jailed, and the crimes of financial fraud and perjury are upheld as
lawful and rewarded by the courts, the U.S. Treasury and the Congress.
And all this is done so a handful of rapacious,
immoral plutocrats like
Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs who
sucks down about $250,000 a day and who lied to the U.S. Congress as well as
his investors and the public, can use their dirty money to retreat into
their own Forbidden City or Versailles while their underlings, basking in
the arrogance of power, snap amusing photos of the rabble outside their
gates being hauled away by the police and company goons.
It is vital that the occupation movements direct attention away from their
encampments and tent cities, beset with the usual problems of hastily formed
open societies where no one is turned away.
Attention must be directed through street
protests, civil disobedience and occupations toward the institutions that
are carrying out the assaults against the 99 percent.
-
Banks
-
Insurance companies
-
Courts where
families are being foreclosed from their homes
-
City offices that put these
homes up for auction
-
Schools
-
Libraries
-
Firehouses that are being
closed
-
Corporations such as General Electric that funnel taxpayer
dollars into useless weapons systems and do not pay taxes
-
Propaganda outlets such as the New York Post and its evil twin, Fox News,
which have unleashed a vicious propaganda war against us,
...all need to be
targeted, shut down and occupied.
Goldman Sachs is the poster child of all that is
wrong with global capitalism, but there are many other companies whose
degradation and destruction of human life are no less egregious.
It is always the respectable classes, the polished Ivy League graduates, the
prep school boys and girls who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., or Short Hills,
N.J., who are the most susceptible to evil.
To be intelligent, as many are at least in a
narrow, analytical way, is morally neutral.
These respectable citizens are inculcated in
their elitist enclaves with values and norms, including pious acts of
charity used to justify their privilege, and a belief in the innate goodness
of American power. They are trained to pay deference to systems of
authority. They are taught to believe in their own goodness, unable to see
or comprehend - and are perhaps indifferent to - the cruelty inflicted on
others by the exclusive systems they serve.
And as norms mutate and change, as the world is
steadily transformed by corporate forces into one of a small cabal of
predators and a vast herd of human prey, these elites seamlessly replace one
set of values with another.
These elites obey the rules. They make the
system work. And they are rewarded for this.
In return, they do not question.
Those who resist - the doubters, outcasts, renegades, skeptics and rebels -
rarely come from the elite. They ask different questions. They seek
something else - a life of meaning.
They have grasped Immanuel Kants dictum,
If justice perishes, human life on Earth
has lost its meaning.
And in their search they come to the conclusion
that, as Socrates said, it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong.
This conclusion is rational, yet cannot be
rationally defended. It makes a leap into the moral, which is beyond
rational thought. It refuses to place a monetary value on human life. It
acknowledges human life, indeed all life, as sacred.
And this is why, as Arendt points out, the only
morally reliable people when the chips are down are not those who say,
this is wrong, or this should not be
done, but those who say I cant.
The greatest evildoers are those who dont remember because they have
never given thought to the matter, and, without remembrance, nothing can
hold them back, Arendt writes.
For human beings, thinking of past matters
means moving in the dimension of depth, striking roots and thus
stabilizing ourselves, so as not to be swept away by whatever may occur
- the Zeitgeist or History or simple temptation. The greatest evil is
not radical, it has no roots, and because it has no roots it has no
limitations, it can go to unthinkable extremes and sweep over the whole
world.
There are streaks in my lungs, traces of the
tuberculosis that I picked up around hundreds of dying Sudanese during the
famine I covered as a foreign correspondent.
I was strong and privileged and fought off the
disease. They were not and did not.
The bodies, most of them children, were
dumped into hastily dug mass graves. The scars I carry within me are the
whispers of these dead. They are the faint marks of those who never had a
chance to become men or women, to fall in love and have children of their
own. I carried these scars to the doors of Goldman Sachs. I had returned to
living.
Those whose last breaths had marked my lungs had
not. I placed myself at the feet of these commodity traders to call for
justice because the dead, and those who are dying in slums and refugee camps
across the planet, could not make this journey. I see their faces.
They haunt me in the day and come to me in the
dark. They force me to remember. They make me choose sides.
As the metal handcuffs were fastened around my
wrists I thought of them, as I often think of them, and I said to myself:
Free at last. Free at last. Thank God
almighty I am free at last.
