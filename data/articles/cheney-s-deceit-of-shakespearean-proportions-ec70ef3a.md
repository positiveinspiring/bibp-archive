Behold this unctuous knave, a disgrace to his
nation as few before him, yet boasting unvarnished virtue.
The deceit of Dick Cheney is indeed of
Shakespearean proportions, as evidenced in his new memoir. For the
former vice president, lying comes so easily that one must assume he takes
the pursuit of truth to be nothing more than a reckless indulgence.
Here is a man who, more than anyone else in the Bush administration,
trafficked in the campaign of deceit that caused tens of thousands to die,
wasted trillions of dollars in resources and indelibly sullied the legacy of
this nation through the practice of torture. Still, this villain claims
that, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the horrid methods
he endorsed were a necessary response to the threat of
Osama
bin Laden.
How convenient to ignore that it was
Barack
Obama, a resolutely anti-torture president, who made good on
the promise of Cheney and the previous administration to take down the
al-Qaeda leader.
Not to mention that bin Laden was killed in his hiding place in Pakistan, a
nation that the Bush administration had befriended after 9/11 when it lifted
the sanctions previously imposed in retaliation for Pakistan's nuclear
weapons program - a program that was connected with the proliferation of
nuclear weapons know-how and the sale of nuclear material to,
Pakistan joined with only two other nations,
...in granting diplomatic recognition to the Talibani government
that provided a safe haven for al-Qaeda as bin Laden orchestrated
the
9/11 attack.
But instead of focusing on the source of the
problem, Cheney led the effort to overthrow
Saddam Hussein, who had
ruthlessly hounded any al-Qaeda operatives who dared function in Iraq.
You don't have to slog too deeply through Dick Cheney's advertisement for
himself to grasp not only
the wicked cynicism of the man but also how
shallow are his perceptions.
He recalls his college years in the 1960s, when
he was a draft-deferred young Republican during America's murderous
adventure in Vietnam - in which more than 3 million Indochinese and 59,000
Americans were killed - as a time of career advancement through strategic
Washington appointments.
The war that left Martin Luther King Jr. condemning his own
government as,
"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today",
...is
regretted in Cheney's memoir only for the reactive violence that he
attributes to anti-war student protesters.
We are told, in a reminiscence of his days as a
graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, that,
"in May 1969, students threw rocks and
bottles at police trying to shut down a party on Mifflin Street," but
there is nothing of napalmed Vietnamese or U.S. troops in body bags.
That same May, young Cheney's Republican
contacts in Washington would pay off, when he secured an appointment in the
Nixon administration working for none other than
Donald Rumsfeld.
Cheney recalls that he didn't know he was,
"signing up for a 40-year career in politics
and government - but that was exactly the right call."
Those 40 years, interrupted by a lucrative stint
at defense contractor
Halliburton, saw Cheney rise to become secretary of
defense and later vice president, presiding over wars that put him in
considerable conflict with Colin Powell.
It is Powell - who was experiencing the reality
of war in Vietnam at the time Cheney was winning bureaucratic battles in
Washington - who is scorned in Cheney's memoir as the hopeless dove.
It was the more cautious war veteran Powell who, as chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff during the first Iraq war, proved to be far more effective a
leader than Cheney, who was then secretary of defense. What is confirmed by
Cheney's memoir is that he seized upon the second Iraq invasion as a way of
settling scores with his adversary by assuming the role of an
ultra-militarist.
Powell, who inside the administration clearly opposed the invasion of Iraq -
"If you break it, you own it" - was cast as a puppet who in a dramatic
appearance before the United Nations lied to the world about Iraq's
possession of weapons of mass destruction.
But despite Powell's woefully misplaced sense of
loyalty to President
George W. Bush, Cheney is merciless in
condemning the general for allegedly undermining the administration.
Powell has fired back at what he termed Cheney's
"cheap shots" and reminds us that,
"Mr. Cheney and many of his colleagues did
not prepare for what happened after the fall of Baghdad."
It's not clear that Cheney is a true believer in
military mayhem as much as he is an uncontrollable careerist who finds war
talk a convenient tool for advancement.
He seems to have no real sense of the cost of
the Iraq War beyond what it might have done to hurt his own legacy.
If his memoir has any enduring value, it is not
as another offering of hollow excuses for an unjustifiable war but rather as
a study in what the famed historian of European fascism, Hannah Arendt,
termed the "banality of evil."
