Finland, as so many other countries in Europe as
well as in Asia, experienced a devastating economical collapse in the
1990s.
This writer has been researching the event
privately and in the Uppsala University, Sweden. The summary presented here
is only a superficial scratch of the very complex case. Only main events,
outcomes together with the legal analysis will be presented.
The huge amount
of victims should finally get justice.
This is a story of a country which has been sold to foreign actors i.e.
foreign people planned and executed the economical destruction and local top
people aided the process. In this sense there are no news compared with
other cases.
The background of the developments in Finland lies on the concept of
globalization. All capabilities to protect the country were lifted. This is,
financial market was opened and local finance inspection was controlled. The
so called market forces made everything happen.
The planning of the banking crises began in early state in 1990.
First in
1992 when the chaos was well on the way started to happen. In March President Mauno Koivisto invited
the top baking executives to the presidential premises. The message of the
banks was that they should get rid of liabilities up to FIM 180 billion.
When calculated this number with all liabilities the real figure would be
about FIM 256 billion. This equals about 45 percent of all liabilities on
the banking sector. The plan was accepted and adopted.
The following meeting held with the President Koivisto took place in May
1992. This time the judicial people were invited to the President Koivisto.
Although President Koivisto was officially the host of the seminar, the
program and management of the seminar was carried out by invited people.
The
invited group, about 40 people, consisted of the Supreme Court
members, judges from lower level courts as well as professors of law.
Finance Inspection
authority was also invited. According to the invitation letter the objective
of the seminar was to evaluate and criticize the judicial operations and
practice. The outcome of the seminar was the total collapse of the legal
system in Finland. The effective remedies and fair trial as legal principles
were removed. One study presented the result of the meeting with the
following figure - out of about 3000 hearings banks won 2998 and the debtor
only two.
Although the period of financial crises consists of several taskforces and
publication the third quotable matter is the secret agreement signed in
October 1993 between the major banks and the State of Finland.
Parties agreed that the buyers were entitled to
transfer customers with loans and guarantees to the bad bank Arsenal. The
right to transfer was defined through the ownership of companies and through
loan agreements i.e. promissory notes and notes of debt etc.
It was also agreed that the banks were entitled
to transfer certain lines of businesses which are real estate business and
any business related to real estate business, other investment business,
construction, any retail business, hotel and restaurant business, any
business related to leisure business.
This meant from bank customer point of view that
the banks were entitled to transfer any customer or force the company in
bankruptcy. Beside private people about 22 percent of all active companies
faced the bankruptcy. According to the bank of Finland provided statistics
about FIM 256 billion worth nominal value loans were transferred out from
banks.
Due to the undervaluation of properties the real amount of stolen
property is about 1,7-2 times of the nominal value.
This is that the stolen value would be about
70-90 billion Euros.
Other outcomes besides the lost property values are the decreased volumes in
sales, construction etc. The horrified result of this exercise is the
increased numbers of suicides, divorces and mental damages and so on.
People have tried to get justice, tried to get the case of their heard by an
independent court. So far this has not succeeded. There is, however, one
possibility to do. It is the international criminal law based on the
universality principle.
The fair trial and effective remedies are the core elements in a
constitutional state. In Finland those values were forgotten during the time
of banking crisis. The case law provides the proof on that issue. The
rulings of the European Court of Human Rights support the comprehension. In
the absence of fair trials and effective remedies the trials are useless.
Therefore it is important to discuss the
additional possibilities how the victims of the Finnish plot would be able
to enjoy the benefits of fair justice, claim damages and begin the healing
process.
The main are in the international trial would be crimes against the
humanity.
The crime against humanity is described in the
Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes
and Crimes Against Humanity of the United Nations as follows:
The General Assembly of the United Nations
states in its resolutions 2184(XXI) of 12 December 1966 and 2202(XXI) of
16 December 1966 which expressly condemned as crimes against humanity
the violation of the economic and political rights.
The Rome Statue of
the International Criminal Court is another foundation for the elements
of the crime of the crimes against humanity.
Thousands of deaths should be analyzed against
elements of crime like causing death by indirect methods or extermination by
inflicting conditions of life.
Further there are questions concerning serious
discrimination, expropriation, crime against humanity of imprisonment,
torture i.e. the perpetrator inflicted severe physical or mental pain or
suffering upon one or more persons, persecution i.e. the perpetrator
severely deprived, contrary to international law, one or more persons of
fundamental rights, other inhumane acts i.e. the perpetrator inflicted great
suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health, by
means of an inhumane act.
In this context we shouldnt either forget in this context the United
Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and
Abuse of Power and Principles of international co-operation in the
detection, arrest, extradition of persons guilty of war crimes and crimes
against humanity.
Among other things following requirements are presented by
the United Nations:
"Victims" means persons who, individually or collectively, have suffered
harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic
loss or substantial impairment of their fundamental rights, through acts or
omissions that are in violation of criminal laws operative within Member
States, including those laws proscribing criminal abuse of power.
War crimes and crimes against humanity, wherever they are committed, shall
be subject to investigation and the persons against whom there is evidence
that they have committed such crimes shall be subject to tracing, arrest,
trial and, if found guilty, to punishment.
The Finnish people are persistent and unyielding.
At the moment this process
needs international support and some resources. The European international
lawyers have accepted the case and they are ready and willing to file the
case. The proof and documentation exists.
This trial would be partly a trial against the
international financial cabal.
