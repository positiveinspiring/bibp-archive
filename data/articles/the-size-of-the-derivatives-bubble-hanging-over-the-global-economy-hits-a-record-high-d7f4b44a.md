The global derivatives bubble is now 20 percent
bigger than it was just before the last great financial crisis struck in
2008.
It is a financial bubble far larger than
anything the world has ever seen, and when it finally bursts it is going to
be a complete and utter nightmare for the financial system of the planet.
According to the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS),
the total notional value of derivatives contracts around the world has
ballooned to an astounding 710 trillion dollars ($710,000,000,000,000).
Other estimates put the grand total well over a
quadrillion dollars. If that sounds like a lot of money, that is because it
is.
For example, U.S. GDP is projected to be in the
neighborhood of around 17 trillion dollars for 2014.
So 710 trillion
dollars is an amount of money that is almost incomprehensible. Instead of
actually doing something about the insanely reckless behavior of the big
banks, our leaders have allowed the derivatives bubble and these banks to
get larger than ever.
In fact,
as I have written about previously, the big
Wall Street banks are collectively 37 percent larger than they were just
prior to the last recession.
"Too big to fail" is a far more massive problem
than it was the last time around, and at some point this derivatives bubble
is going to burst and start taking those banks down. When that day arrives,
we are going to be facing a crisis that is going to make 2008 look like a
Sunday picnic.
If you do not know what a derivative is, Mayra Rodr√≠guez Valladares, a managing principal at MRV Associates, provided a
pretty good definition in her recent article
for the New York Times...
A derivative, put simply, is a contract
between two parties whose value is determined by changes in the value of
an underlying asset. Those assets could be bonds, equities, commodities
or currencies.
The majority of contracts are traded over the counter,
where details about pricing, risk measurement and collateral, if any,
are not available to the public.

In other words, a derivative does not have any
intrinsic value. It is essentially a side bet.
Most commonly, derivative
contracts have to do with the movement of interest rates. But there are
many, many other kinds of derivatives as well. People are betting on just
about anything and everything that you can imagine, and Wall Street has been
transformed into the largest casino in the history of the planet.
After the
last financial crisis, our politicians
promised us that they would do something to get derivatives trading under
control. But instead, the size of the derivatives bubble has reached a new
record high.
In
the New York Times article I mentioned
above, Goldman Sachs and Citibank
were singled out as two players that have experienced tremendous growth in
this area in recent years...
Goldman Sachs has been increasing its
derivatives volumes since the crisis, and it had a portfolio of about
$48 trillion at the end of 2013. Bloomberg Businessweek
recently reported that as part of its growth strategy, Goldman plans
to sell more derivatives to clients.
Citibank, too, has been increasing
its derivatives portfolio, despite the numerous capital and regulatory
challenges, In fact, its portfolio has risen by
over 65 percent
since the crisis - the most of any of the four banks - to
$62
trillion.
According to
official government numbers, the top 25 banks in the United States now
have a grand total of more than 236 trillion dollars of exposure to
derivatives.
But there are four banks that dwarf everyone else.
The following are the latest numbers for those
four banks...
-
JPMorgan Chase
Total Assets: $1,945,467,000,000 (nearly
2 trillion dollars)
Total Exposure To Derivatives:
$70,088,625,000,000 (more than 70 trillion dollars)
-
Citibank
Total Assets: $1,346,747,000,000 (a bit
more than 1.3 trillion dollars)
Total Exposure To Derivatives:
$62,247,698,000,000 (more than 62 trillion dollars)
-
Bank Of America
Total Assets: $1,433,716,000,000 (a bit
more than 1.4 trillion dollars)
Total Exposure To Derivatives:
$38,850,900,000,000 (more than 38 trillion dollars)
-
Goldman Sachs
Total Assets: $105,616,000,000 (just a
shade over 105 billion dollars yes, you read that correctly)
Total Exposure To Derivatives:
$48,611,684,000,000 (more than 48 trillion dollars)
If the stock market keeps going up, interest
rates stay fairly stable and the global economy does not experience a major
downturn, this bubble will probably not burst for a while.
But if there is a major shock to the system, we
could easily experience a major derivatives crisis very rapidly and several
of those banks could fail simultaneously.
There are many out there that would welcome the
collapse of the big banks, but that would also be very bad news for the rest
of us.
You see, the truth is that the U.S. economy is
like a very sick patient with an extremely advanced case of cancer. You can
try to kill the cancer (the banks), but in the process you will inevitably
kill the patient as well.
Right now, the five largest banks account for
42 percent of all loans in the entire country, and the six largest banks
control 67 percent of all banking assets.
If they go down, we go down too.
That is why the fact that they have been so
reckless is so infuriating.
Just look at the numbers for Goldman Sachs
again. At this point, the total exposure that Goldman Sachs has to
derivatives contracts is more than 460 times greater than
their total assets.
And this kind of thing is not just happening in
the United States. German banking giant Deutsche Bank has
more than 75 trillion dollars of exposure to derivatives. That is even
more than any single U.S. bank has.
This derivatives bubble is a "sword
of Damocles" that is hanging over the global economy by a thread day
after day, month after month, year after year.
At some point that thread is going to break, the
bubble is going to burst, and then all hell is going to break loose.
You see, the truth is that virtually none of the
underlying problems that caused the last financial crisis have been fixed. Instead, our problems have just gotten even
bigger and the financial bubbles have gotten even larger.
Never before in the history of the United States
have we been faced with the threat of such a great financial catastrophe.
Sadly, most Americans are totally oblivious to
all of this. They just have faith that our leaders know what they are
doing, and they have been lulled into complacency by the bubble of false
stability that we have been enjoying for the last couple of years.
Unfortunately for them, this bubble of false
stability is not going to last much longer.
A financial crisis far greater than
what we
experienced in 2008 is coming, and it is going to shock the world.
