Part 1 - Imperialism
is Alive and Well
The British Empire didn't just have a fleet that projected its hegemonic
will across the planet, it possessed financial networks to consolidate
global economic power, and system administrators to ensure the endless
efficient flow of resources from distant lands back to London and into the
pockets of England's monied elite.
It was a well oiled machine, refined by
centuries of experience.
While every schoolchild learns about the British Empire, it seems a common
modern-day political malady for adults to believe that reality is organized
as their history books were in school - in neat well defined chapters. This
leads to the common misconception that the age of imperialism is somehow a
closed-chapter in human history. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth.
Imperialism did not go extinct. It simply evolved.
Imperialism is alive & well.
There are several pertinent examples illustrating how imperialism is still
alive and well, and only cleverly disguised with updated nomenclatures.
What
we know today as "free trade" actually derives its origins from economic
concessions the British frequently extorted from nations under its "gunboat
diplomacy" strategy - that is, anchoring gunboats off the coast of a foreign
capital, and threatening bombardment and military conquest if certain
demands were not met.
Colonial Southeast Asia circa 1850's.
Thailand/Siam
was never colonized but made many concessions.
In the mid-1800's, Thailand, then the Kingdom of Siam, was surrounded on all
sides by colonized nations and in turn was made to concede to
the British
1855 Bowring Treaty.
See how many of these "gunboat policy" imposed
concessions sound like today's "economic liberalization:"
-
Siam granted extraterritoriality to British subjects.
-
British could trade freely in all seaports and reside permanently in
Bangkok.
-
British could buy and rent property in Bangkok.
-
British subjects could travel freely in the interior with passes provided
by the consul.
-
Import and export duties were capped at 3%, except the duty-free opium
and bullion.
-
British merchants were to be allowed to buy and sell directly with
individual Siamese.
A more contemporary example would be the outright military conquest of Iraq
and Paul Bremer's (CFR) economic reformation of the broken state.
The
Economist
enumerates the neo-colonial "economic liberalization" of Iraq in a
piece titled "Let's all go to the yard sale: If it all works out, Iraq will
be a capitalist's dream:"
-
100% ownership of Iraqi assets.
-
Full repatriation of profits.
-
Equal legal standing with local firms.
-
Foreign banks allowed to operate or buy into local banks.
-
Income and corporate taxes capped at 15%.
-
Universal tariffs slashed to 5%.
Nomenclatures aside, nothing has changed since 1855 as far as imperialist
"wish-lists" go.
The Economist argued, as would any 18-19th century
imperialist, that Iraq needed foreign expertise to catch up, justifying the
evisceration of their national sovereignty and the foreign stewardship
(theft) of their resources.
Unlike Siam, Iraq refused to concede to the
"gunboats" of modern-day Wall Street & London, and often as the British did
during the "glory days" of the empire, they made good on their threats.
The Anglo-Zulu War.
Causus belli - diamonds & imperial expansion.
And just as the British did when they found diamonds beneath Zululand during
the late-1800's, spurring them to invent a causus belli to justify the
destruction of the Zulu Kingdom, the schemers of modern-day global
imperialism likewise invented a dubious pretext to invade Iraq before
commencing its plundering.
Anglo-Zulu War. Mission accomplished.
The city of Ulandi burns and
the British go about
dividing Zululand into 14 chiefdoms led by compliant,
obedient proxies.
The British took great care to cultivate rivalries between
the 14 chiefdoms
to ensure they would never again unite and
challenge
British hegemonic ambitions throughout the region.
At the conclusion of the Anglo-Zulu War, the British despoiled Zululand,
divided it into 14 separate cheifdoms, each led by a proxy obedient to the
British Empire.
The British ensured that these 14 cheifdoms harbored
animosities toward one another and fostered petty infighting between them to
ensure British interests would never again be challenged by a unified Zulu
threat.
Today we see what seems to be the "accidental" consequences of
military interventions leading to vicious, protracted fighting and in some
cases civil wars, in Iraq, now in Libya (which also had a direct proxy
installed as PM), Pakistan where plans exist to literally carve up the
nation Zululand-style, and Syria. These are not accidental but intentional.
Divide and conquer is a classic military stratagem that has not escaped the
interests and attention of Wall Street & London.
Dwight D. Eisenhower
exit speech on January 17, 1961,
warning us of
the military industrial complex.
Iraq For Sale.
Remember that military industrial complex
President
Dwight Eisenhower warned America about?
The ultimate bottom line with the
Iraq War was that
it should never have been fought in the first place.
If people can study history and see today's events are simply the relabeled
repeating of what empire has been doing for centuries, the public as a whole
will be less likely to go along with what is in reality an exploitative,
murderous crime spree of global proportions - merely sold to us as justified
intervention.
One need only look at how Iraq has been despoiled and the
profits that have been garnered by Fortune 500 corporations, while soldiers
and Iraqis alike pay the price with their minds, bodies, blood, futile
destinies, and lives.
Part II - British
Imperial Administration (proto-NGOs)
A book of invaluable use in understanding British imperial administration is
"Colonial Georgia
- A Study in British Imperial Policy in the Eighteenth
Century." Published by the University of Georgia Press and written by
Trevor
Reese, it successfully endeavored to illustrate "practically every facet of
British colonial policy" using Georgia as a case study.
The colony of Georgia, in what is now the southern United States, was
founded by what is essentially a proto-NGO - and in this case an
organization dedicated to "prison reform." What it really did, was assess
suitable prisoners in London who could be sent to Georgia to fulfill the
needs of the Crown.
Beginning as the "Associates of Dr. Bray" and later
becoming the "Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in
America," or simply the Georgia Trustees, it encapsulates perfectly the use
of noble-intentioned networkers to exploit human tragedy for the benefit of
the elite.
One face of the Georgia Trustee's seal.
It featured the Latin motto,
"Non Sibi Sed Aliis" which means, "Not for self,
but for others." Truly a
proto-NGO, a "system administrator."
The significance of the mulberry leaf,
the silkworm, and the cocoon?
The silk that Britain's new colony of Georgia
was going to export to London
to enrich the empire. "For others" indeed.
While many may argue that prisoners in London were better off being shipped
to Georgia, the underlying point is the dictation of one's destiny for the
benefit of another, regardless of whether or not such exploitation results
in a thriving new life in Georgia, or death defending British expansion in
the New World.
The same cost/benefit analysis could also be made for
slavery, but done so in spite of its essential immorality.
Protestantism for England was also a precursor to modern day NGOs. Religious
denominations were divided directly along political lines in 18th century
Europe, and when shiploads of Protestants were sent to Georgia, so followed
the political networks they represented.
Again, noble-intentions were, and
to this day are, in the forefront of many devoted to these political
functionaries, and much good has been done in their names, but ultimately
the purpose of each empire's church was to establish a bottom-up network of
people who believed they were fulfilling noble, higher intentions, when in
reality they were simply serving the elite of their respective empires.
Unfortunately, despite the noble intentions and great works of many of these
people, when the time came for the Crown to use these networks for less than
noble causes, organizational indoctrination was used to marshal men to it.
And just like modern NGOs today, Protestant organizations interfaced with
and supported directly the primary regional administrators, in Georgia's
case, the Georgia Trustees.
In Reese's book, he even notes on page 21,
"in sanctioning the Georgia
project the British Government was not motivated by any such charitable
intentions as inspired the Trustees. The Ministry was not much interested in
the plight of insolvent and unemployed debtors, but it was concerned about
the defense of the empire."
Similarly today, NGOs have truly dedicated
people "inspired" as the "Trustees" were, but ultimately they are carrying
water for their sponsors, who almost always end up being
George Soros, the OCED, the US State Department's National Endowment for Democracy, and other
purveyors of global corporate-fascist imperialism.
The British Empire's interests in Georgia were economic, while the rouse
used to fill and administer the colony was altruistic.
Another key
characteristic to imperialism is keeping subjects dependent.
Reese offers on
page 27,
"the danger of these [private or charter provinces] lay in the
scope they provided for the construction of independent authorities, and
this was contradictory to the whole principle of colonization."
This, within the contest of mercantilism - essentially the exportation of
raw materials from the colonies, which would be refined in Europe, and then
imported back into the colonies as manufactured goods - meant servile
dependency, both politically and economically - despite the fact that even
then, many features of "democracy" could be found throughout the colonies.
Today's concept of "free-trade" agreements ensure that resources,
manufacturing, refinement, and consumption are equally interdependent on a
global scale despite the fact that technology now exists to make any state
or province, let alone nation, fully independent economically.
Despite the good intentions, the religious causes,
and loyalty to the
crown,
the ultimate destination of all these good intentions wrought
was the
"Board of Trade" which managed the unending
flow of wealth out of Britain's
colonies and into London.
Like NGOs of today, the administrative networks that made up the British
Empire were in many cases entirely dependent on grants from London, as local
contributions were almost never adequate.
Reese notes on page 39,
"constant
need of money made the Trustees permanently dependent on Parliament, without
whose support their colony could not be maintained."
The British Empire
maintained a careful balancing act to ensure that its networks received
enough resources to fulfill their purpose, but never enough to become
independent.
Financial policy conformed to imperial standards and while
local policy was set by local administrators, it interlocked with the Board
of Trade back in London - just as local NGOs now interlock with
international organizations in accordance to rule and norms defined by
international institutions.
Reese quotes Vincent Harlow in his epilogue, who said of Georgia's eventual
independence from Great Britain,
"men's minds indeed conceive new thoughts
and plan new projects, but out of ancient thinking and under potent
influence of long-established characteristics."
Part III -
Re-imagining Imperialism for the 21st Century
We have already seen some examples of how imperialism is very much alive and
well.
We also saw how imperialism was implemented by the British,
Video: Thomas Barnett describes the building of an army of "system
administrators" (aka civil society) to expand into "peace spaces" while US
global military conquers "battle spaces." Soros' Revenue Watch along with
the National Endowment for Democracy have created just such an army of NGOs.
And just as soldiers witlessly promote imperialism believing they are
fighting for "freedom," these NGOs expand Wall Street and London's global
hegemony, believing they are promoting "human rights."
The term "system administrators" was used by US military strategist
Thomas
Barnett before a cackling audience at a 2008 TED Talk titled, "The
Pentagon's New Map for War & Peace" (above video.)
At about 18 minutes into his talk he
begins explaining a concept of reforming the military into two separate
forces, the "US enabled Leviathan force" and the "system administrators."
One takes down the existing networks of targeted nations through air
campaigns, special operations, or invasions, and consists of military assets
including armor, fighters and bombers. The other consists of system
administrators who then build upon the ashes left by the "Leviathan force"
or the chaos sown by a foreign-backed destabilization.
The system
administrators consist of everything from NGOs, international organizations,
and contractors, to civil affairs officers (psychological warfare), and when
necessary, soldiers and Marines.
Barnett warns that if anyone attempts to interfere with the construction of
the West's "system administrator" networks, the,
"Marines are going to come
over and kill you."
This perhaps like British garrisons did to tamp down
dissatisfaction amongst their colonies.
The Boston Massacre.
Resistors to the "system administrators" beware,
try to stop them and "the Marines are going to come over and kill you."
The talk was given in 2008, and already we see solid steps being taking to
expand and utilize just such a force.
Barnett said of the special operations
"trigger pullers" that he wanted the rules to be "as loose as possible."
Just recently, the
Corbett Report and
Media Monarchy reported the expanded
role proposed for "elite" military forces.
Admiral William McRaven of
Special Operations Command was said to be seeking.
"more autonomy to position
his forces and their war-fighting equipment where intelligence and global
events indicate they are most needed."
Video: Special Operations Command is looking for more "autonomy" in
deploying where "intelligence and global events indicate they are most
needed." This "loosening of rules" was part of building the double edged
sword of neo-imperial conquest, the global army & system administrators.
Additionally, between 2008 and 2011 before the outbreak of the Arab Spring,
the US State Department and its network of global facilitators embarked on a
campaign to raise a literal army of NGOs and opposition groups to begin
overthrowing governments and building the very global administration network
Barnett presented at TED.
It was just recently reported in, "Soros
Big-Business Accountability Project Funded by Big-Business" that a similar
army of NGOs is being mobilized to erect system administrators focused on
managing the resources of targeted nations.
Called Revenue Watch, and
focused primarily on Africa and Southeast Asia it represents the "system
administration" approach complimenting aggressive moves made by AFRICOM in
Africa, and the declaration of America's "Pacific Century" in Asia.
It is quite clear that Barnett's proposal doesn't necessarily need the
"US-enabled Leviathan force" to tear down targeted networks as seen in
the
US-funded Arab Spring.
Fomenting unrest, up to and including armed
insurrection falls short of overt military intervention and utilizes assets Barrent
described in the Leviathan force such as "trigger pulling" special
operations, as well as civil affairs units, NGOs, and contractors from the
system administration side.
In Libya for example, NGOs and civil affairs advisers began the unrest in
February of 2011 while weapons were covertly moved in to arm fighters to
overthrow the Qaddafi government. International organizations like the ICC
were used to poison public opinion against the Libyan government using
information supplied to them from NGOs, while NATO began preparing for a
full scale air campaign.
Once the bombing began, it was only a matter of
incrementally increasing the torrent of special operations forces, arms, and
other facilitators to fill in the void left by NATO's relentless air
campaign.
Thus the forces of Leviathan and the system administrators worked
in tandem, one clearing a path through the old, the other building new
networks to facilitate the installment of long-time US resident and
Petroleum Institute chairman, Abdurrahim el-Keib, as PM.
In nations where military options like this are not an option and would be
difficult if not impossible to ever justify, like Thailand for example, the
full weight of Wall Street and London's support is thrown behind system
administrators and suitable opposition movements that will make appropriate
proxies if the targeted sovereign networks can be torn down.
In Thailand's case, that proxy is
Thaksin Shinawatra, a former
Carlyle Group
adviser, and recipient of extensive US backing, including lobbying services
from fellow Carlyle member James Baker and his firm Baker Botts, Bush's
personal envoy to Iraq Robert Blackwill of Barbour Griffith & Rogers, and
PNAC signatory Kenneth Adelman of Edelman.
During Thaksin's term in office
from 2001 until a coup ousted him in 2006, upon the eve of which he was
literally reporting to the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York, he had
committed Thai troops to the US invasion of Iraq and
allowed the CIA to use
Thailand for its abhorrent rendition program.
He now currently leads the forces of a "color revolution," the stand-ins for
Barnett's occupation force, since such a Western force is untenable. This
included his documented use of armed militants in 2010 during an attempted
insurrection.
They are billed the "red shirts" or United Front for Democracy
Against Dictatorship (UDD) and have met with,
-
Soros' Open Society-funded
Human Rights Watch
-
the National Democratic Institute for International
Affairs (NDI)
-
National Endowment for Democracy (NED)
-
the U.S.-ASEAN
Business Council,
...in an April 2011 Washington D.C. visit.
It is clear that NGOs and opposition movements many believe
are
spontaneous, indigenous, and independent are in fact part of a larger
network
for the sole purpose of imposing and maintaining global system
administration.
This is not a web of elaborate, vague associations.
In each
case there is direct path of funding leading back to Western foundations
and
the think-tanks that devise policy for them, all funded and chaired
by the
Fortune 500 of Wall Street and London.
There are also circles of academia being produced to support efforts to
undermine and overthrow Thailand's sovereign indigenous networks, most
notably "Nitirat" or the "Enlightened Jurists" whose audiences consist
almost entirely of Thaksin's red shirts, and even included Thaksin's US
registered lobbyist, Robert Amsterdam sitting in the front row.
Finally there are the NGOs like propaganda outfit Prachatai, which receives
100's of thousands of dollars a year from the US State Department via the
National Endowment for Democracy, George Soros' Open Society, and USAID.
NED
also funds the Campaign Committee for Human Rights, the Cross Cultural
Foundation (CrCF), and the Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the
Wants.
In addition to sharing the same foreign sponsors, each cross-posts
the other's work, each signs petitions on the others behalf and each
perpetuate identical agendas.
While their mission statements claim to
promote "freedom," "democracy," and "human rights," one cannot help but
wonder how they reconcile the backgrounds of their sponsors and the
"international" organizations they interlock with, with the causes they
allegedly promote, with the work they actually carry out.
Clearly there are "strings attached" to NGO Prachatai's funding
from
the National Endowment for Democracy and Freedom House
who regularly
contributes posts, support, and award nominations
to the Thai "independent
journalists."
It is also clear how these same interests are involved
in the
support of Thaksin Shinawatra,
the imperial proxy of choice for Thailand.
The
National Endowment for Democracy and its subsidiary Freedom House
features boards of directors much resembling a revolving door, with current
and former members of Congress, the US State Department, corporate lobbying
firms, and corporate board members of some of the largest corporations on
earth including Exxon, Boeing, Ford, and Goldman Sachs constantly shifting
in and out of government, big-business, and NGO positions.
They are, just as
the British were, "not motivated by any such charitable intentions," as
inspire the well-intentioned people drawn into the cause of NGOs like Prachatai they fund.
Their hope is to eventually diminish the power and influence of Thailand's
own indigenous networks, by gradually building up the capacity of Wall
Street & London's system administrators.
Just like in the example of
Georgia, ignorance and good intentions are used to swell the ranks of these
networks, and just like in Georgia, they are kept purposefully dependent on
the constant and substantial support provided by Wall Street & London, as
local contributions are almost never enough.
And while many of these people
may believe they are committed to a "higher cause," they are simply soldiers
of another kind within an imperial system perfected over centuries of trial
and error.
The activists on the ground may be of genuine good-intentions but surely
there are some who realize the conflict between their stated mission and the
insincere intentions of those funding them from abroad.
Just like the army,
this system of NGOs perpetuates itself on the ignorance of the general
population - of those drawn in by their good intentions to contribute to
what they believe is a noble cause, and those throughout society who see
these networks spreading across the planet with no idea of what their true
purpose is.
Trevor Reese leaves us with one more relevant observation concerning the
state of imperialism in the 18th century that still very much applies today:
"In the Eighteenth century, colonial affairs were subsidiary issues in
English political life; Sir John Seeley's dictum that the British people
founded an empire in a fit of absence of mind is true in the sense that
imperial expansion seldom commanded public attention.
Although there were
always a few critics in the country who expressed anti-imperialist
sentiments and feared that the empire would ultimately escape from the
control of the mother-country, they represented only a small minority.
Generally, when people thought about the colonies, which was not often, they
regard them with mild approval, and believe in the advantage of an empire
even though they knew little about it."
In the same way, today many people remain in the dark about what Wall Street
& London do overseas.
While military interventions grab headlines and create
a brief but confusing diversion for most, they are but mildly aware of the
concept of NGOs, let alone how they work in tandem with the creeping war
machine making its way from Tunisia to Thailand and everywhere in between.
While today's media is able to project images onto our perception of what an
NGO is, with pictures of smiling Africans clutching bags of USAID rice,
thriving wildlife, and sprouting, dew covered seedlings, in reality it is a
centralized operation built to tear down the old world, and replace with a
new one.
One that does not answer to the people that inhabit it on anything
but the most superficial of levels, but rather to the people that rule over
it - the monied elite, as they always have, with the most vicious feeding
their competitors ruthlessly into their maw and gladly expanding into the
place left at the table.
Link Part IV -
Empire's Weakness is Independence
Empires require subjects.
Without subjects there is no empire. There is no
fleet, there are no Marines, there are no imperial administrators. There are
no laborers to gather and send resources back to be refined, no one to
refine them in the factories and send them back, and surely no one to buy
these manufactured goods when they arrive.
Empire requires subjects to be preferable ignorant, easily manipulated,
indoctrinated in a manner that motivates them to carry out their necessary
function within the empire reliably. They need subjects that believe in the
empire and most importantly, they need subjects who are hopelessly dependent
on it.
It is no coincidence then that nations declared their "independence"
from England in pursuit of their freedom.
By boycotting the British system,
the Founding Fathers were already
free and independent men
by the time they signed the Declaration of
Independence.
The coming war would be to defend that freedom.
Before the great battles of the American Revolution took place and the
victory that followed, the Founding Fathers took it upon themselves to
declare their independence not only by writ, but also by action.
Our
Founding Fathers ceased the import of British goods, they created their own
monetary system, they assembled their own militias, and most importantly
they formed their own government based upon their own values, not King
George's self-interest.
This truly measurable independence turned out to be the key to their
success, for independence is freedom, and freedom from tyranny is victory.
The battle they fought was not one to free themselves, instead, it was
fought to defend the freedom from the British system they had already
achieved.
In "Naming Names
- Your Real Government" a list of the most common,
reoccurring corporate-financier interests and the think-tanks they use to
create, promote, publish, and execute their policy was provide.
The article
concluded by stating:
"These organizations represent the collective interests of the largest
corporations on earth.
They not only retain armies of policy wonks and
researchers to articulate their agenda and form a consensus internally, but
also use their massive accumulation of unwarranted influence in media,
industry, [across a global network of NGOs,] and finance to manufacture a
self-serving consensus internationally.
To believe that this corporate-financier oligarchy would subject their
agenda and fate to the whims of the voting masses is naive at best.
They
have painstakingly ensured that no matter who gets into office, in whatever
country, the guns, the oil, the wealth and the power keep flowing
perpetually into their own hands."
This is confirmed in a talk given by Noam Chomsky in 1993, where he stated
or the National Endowment for Democracy's work,
"it's an attempt to impose
what is called democracy, meaning rule by the rich and the powerful, without
interference by the mob but within the framework of formal electoral
procedures."
Quite clearly it is, along with Open Society, and the vast
network of system administrators being built up across the planet, working
in witless tandem with NATO, building in the swath of destruction it leaves
behind the homogeneous workings of a global corporate-financier-run empire.
If the world is indeed run by corporate-financier interests, and voting is
not only futile but gives the population a false sense of security, what can
we do instead to declare our independence from modern empire?
On a daily basis, across the planet, billions of people witlessly pay into
this empire, buying their products, paying them their attention on
diversions like TV, radio, and at the theater, and participating in systems,
organizations, and causes that like the "Georgia Trustees" may have started
out working for prison reform, ended up handing the empire another thriving
colony to exploit.
It is clear then that vast campaigning, elections,
rallies, and protests are not necessary or even viable options in
dismantling this system - rather our daily decisions to boycott their
corporations, pull the plug on our TVs, switch off the radio, leave the
theaters empty and refuse to recognize the legitimacy of corporate-backed
institutions and organizations on both national and international levels.
Video: The Fab Lab. Turning consumers into producers with manufacturing
technology, open source collaboration, and innovation. It also opens the
doors for communities to work together and solve their own problems, rather
than waiting for them to be solved by disingenuous elected representatives.
Instead, find local solutions, pursue self-sufficiency, self-reliance, and
leverage technology to do for ourselves tomorrow what we depend on
corporations to do for us today.
We can start today, by simply "voting"
local with our wallets, "voting" to read, watch, and listen to truly
independent media instead of Hollywood - or better yet - creating our own
content ourselves.
The same could be said with the news. Stop humoring the
professional liars on BBC who get caught in serial scams involving paid-for
documentaries, biased reporting, and flat out lying to their audience. There
is a thriving alternative media that already proves the merits of doing
more, doing better, and doing it all ourselves.
As concluded in "The Real Revolution,"
"They need us, we dont need them. Thats the big secret.
We get our freedom
back as soon as we take back our responsibilities for food, water, security,
the monetary system, power, and manufacturing; that is independence.
Independence is freedom, freedom is independence. Well never be free as
long as we depend on the Fortune 500 for our survival.
Fixing these problems unfolding overseas starts with fixing the problems in
our own backyards. Boycott the globalists, cut off their support, undermine
their system, and they lose their ability to commit these atrocities. That
will be a real revolution and it can start today.
Not burning cities and
masked rebels waving flags, but communities no longer dependent and fueling
a corrupt system we all know must come to an end."
