# A Tale of Two Countries - New Zealand Apologizes for Illegal Domestic 
Spying, While U.S. Still Refuses to Acknowledge NSAÂ’s Warrantless Wiretapping

Imagine this:
A government,
faced with public evidence that its foreign spy service
was conducting domestic surveillance on its residents -
instead of claiming the information is somehow secret
and the people responsible are above the reach of the
law - admits in public and in the courtroom that it
violated basic rights.
That is exactly what
happened last week in New Zealand in the controversial
copyright infringement case surrounding
Megaupload and its founder Kim Dotcom.
At the same
time in the US, the government is faced a very similar
scenario:
overwhelming evidence the National Security Agency (NSA)
has illegally spied on Americans.
However, not only
has the government refused to admit any wrongdoing, it
is actively trying to prevent courts from coming to any
conclusions.
As EFF
has previously reported, the case against Megaupload
and Dotcom has been controversial from the start. Dotcom
was arrested in New Zealand, while the U.S. government
seized Megauploads property and executed search
warrants on its leased servers based on claims of
alleged copyright infringement the day after
SOPA was
declared dead by Congress.
The
military-style raid by the New Zealand police was
criticized as over-excessive. And the loss of access to
the servers has left
many innocent users without access to their lawful
data.
Then in June, the High Court
in New Zealand ruled the warrants executed for the raid
in New Zealand were invalid,
making the resulting searches and seizures
illegal. Now add that to the recent news that the
Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) - New
Zealands equivalent to the NSA -
was illegally spying on Dotcom by monitoring all
Internet traffic coming to and from his home.
(The GCSB
is legally barred some spying on residents of New
Zealand, and a cursory check of government records shown
Dotcom has been an official resident since 2010.)
New Zealands Prime Minister
said he became aware of the illegal spying a few weeks
ago and
ordered an inquiry with the agencys Inspector
General.
Immediately, the Prime Minister also publicly
admitted that the GCSB,
had acquired communications in
some instances without statutory authority."
He
also filed a memorandum with the court in the
Megaupload case in New Zealand, making the same
admissions to the judge.
When the Inspector General
came back just two days later and concluded the GCSB did
indeed break the law, the Prime Minister personally
apologized to Dotcom for violating his rights, adding,
"Frankly, I'm pretty appalled by what I've seen because
these are basic errors."
While there
are still unanswered questions in the GCSB case, New
Zealands apologetic prime minister and vigilant
judiciary stand in stark contrast to the current
situation in the US, where overwhelming evidence has
shown for years the National Security Agency has been
warrantlessly wiretapping Americans on domestic soil
since a few days after the September 11th
terrorist attacks.
But instead of admitting to
the spying and apologizing the public, the government
has decided to stonewall and obfuscate the truth.
In EFFs long
running lawsuit against the NSA - which
will be heard in federal court in mid-December - the
Obama administration has invoked the controversial
state secrets privilege, arguing even if all of the
allegations are true, the court cannot decide the case
because that process, even if done under secure court
procedures, might reveal national security secrets.
Of course, the facts are
indisputable and have been public for years.
Government officials have admitted key details in
Congressional testimony and on-the-record news
interviews.
Virtually
every major news organization has reported on the
NSAs unconstitutional actions.
EFF submitted evidence
on behalf of AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein, which
includes blueprints and photographs of the NSAs
secret room at AT&T San Francisco facility.
Three former NSA employees, who worked closely on its computer
systems leading up to 9/11,
also have submitted declarations explaining how the
agency has spied on Americans on domestic soil in
violation of the law.
Further, instead of coming
clean to the public about who has adversely affected by
illegal spying, the NSA
has refused to release even a general estimate on
the number of Americans affected (somewhat audaciously
invoking privacy as an excuse).
Instead of vowing to
prevent further violations of citizens constitutional
rights, both the
Bush and Obama administration have stonewalled any
attempts to install transparency or privacy safeguards
on the program through the FISA Amendments Act.
And
instead of supporting accountability, both Bush and
Obama supported giving AT&T and the other telecom
companies
complete retroactive immunity for partnering with
the NSA in violation of the law.
The New Zealand spy agencies
clearly erred when they illegally spied on Dotcom, but
the governments response to the scandal has been
commendable, and serves as a good example of how a
government can prevent this type of spying from
happening in the future.
If only Americans had a
government that would do the same.
