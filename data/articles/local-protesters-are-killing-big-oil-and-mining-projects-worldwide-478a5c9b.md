# Local Protesters are Killing Big Oil and Mining Projects Worldwide

Multinational corporations are infamous for
pushing native people off their land in order to open
a new gold mine, extract oil, or otherwise extract local resources.
For decades, backlash has been thought to be
both limited and ineffectual, but new evidence suggests that protests
from local people are effective, extremely costly for the companies, and
often lead to substantive changes to or total abandonment of a project.
Researchers at the Centre for Social
Responsibility in Mining interviewed employees at several dozen major
international corporations who are involved with extractive activities,
and found that companies are increasingly having to deal with the social
and environmental impacts of their work, and that it's hurting them
where it hurts most: their bottom lines.
The researchers, led by Daniel Franks, took
a look at 50 planned major extractive projects (oil drilling, new mine
construction, that sort of thing) and found that in fully half of them,
local people launched some sort of "project blockade."
In 40 percent of the projects, someone died
as a result of a physical protest, and 15 of the projects were suspended
or abandoned altogether, according to Franks' study, published in
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
"There is a popular misconception that
local communities are powerless in the face of large corporations
and governments," Franks said in a statement.
"Our findings show that community
mobilization can be very effective at raising the costs to
companies."

The reason these projects, such as the Minas
Conga
gold mine in northern Peru and Lanjigarh bauxite mining project in
Orissa, India, were abandoned wasn't borne out of some sense of social
responsibility to not pollute the environment or to not push people off
their land.
It was because the protests and resulting
government backlash was so great that it became financially unviable to
move forward. Delays, even early in a project, can be extremely costly -
at a major mining project, $20 million per week in lost revenues and
lost investment isn't uncommon.
According to the study's respondents, a
nine-month delay at a Latin American mine cost a company $750 million;
protests that shut down power lines at another operation cost $750,000 a
day.
Even before drilling or extraction has
started, lost wages and startup delays can cost $50,000 a day when
programs are forced to a standstill after they've started.
Perhaps not surprisingly, protests were most
successful when they took place early on, during feasibility and
construction phases of a project.
"This
[is] in part because the project is smaller in scale and therefore
easier to contest, but also because at later stages of the project
cycle, capital has been sunk into an area, changes become costly to
retrofit, revenues begin to be generated, and there are increased
incentives for companies and governments to defend' their
projects," Franks wrote.
Social media and
internet access are allowing indigenous and
local groups to organize more quickly, to learn from others who have had
successful protests, and to connect with nonprofits and humanitarian
groups that can help push their stories out to the entire world.
"There's been a big change in the
mentality of indigenous people - things like Facebook are allowing
them to not be as naive," Kelly Swing, a Boston University
researcher who works in an area of the Ecuadorian
Amazon that is currently fighting back against proposed oil projects,
told me.
"They look at what has happened in, say,
Peru, and see that their culture has gone to hell in a handbasket.
All of a sudden, gifts the companies offer, like boats and education
and modern medicine aren't the panacea they used to seem."
Companies, for their part, are learning how
to anticipate these sorts of hangups, and some of those interviewed (all
identities and specific responses were kept confidential) said that
local backlash can be predicted and quantified before it happens.
"Several interviewees were strongly of
the view that the triggers for and underlying causes of
company-community conflict, and its costs, are predictable, and that
approaches, procedures, and standards are available to companies to
avoid conflict and develop constructive relationships with community
actors," Franks wrote.
At many companies, Franks wrote, the higher
ups who approve major projects are completely oblivious that their work
might have some sort of social or environmental impact.
To combat this, companies hire "translators"
who are able to identify potential social problems and put them in a
language executives can understand: money.
"Translation requires individuals within
organizations who can work across functional, organizational, and
conceptual boundaries, and who can work in more than one language'
and interpret how social and environmental risk is translating into
costs for business.
The need for internal translators'
suggests that corporate decision-makers do not currently have the
necessary models to internalize externalities and translate social
risk inward," Franks wrote.
Franks wrote that there's some evidence that
companies really do want to make sure local people are treated correctly
- that, as he found, concerns such as drinking water contamination,
environmental destruction, and public health risks, are not brushed
aside.
Then again, he noted that,
"some see stakeholder-related concerns
as optional add-ons' to broader regulatory processes for operating
projects."
The challenge for those "stakeholders,"
then, is making sure that, no matter what, they make a project so
difficult to complete that those "add-ons" become so costly that the
project dies.
It seems like, in an increasing number of
cases, that's actually happening.
