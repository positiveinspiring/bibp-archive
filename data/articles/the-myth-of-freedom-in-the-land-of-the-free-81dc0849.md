In 1893, a massive financial panic sent
demand for the Pullman Palace Car Company into a downward spiral.
The luxury rail car company reacted by slashing
workers' wages and increasing their work load. After negotiations with
ownership broke down the following year, the American Railway Union, in
solidarity with Pullman factory workers, launched a boycott that eventually
shut down railroads across the U.S..
It was a full-scale insurrection, as the late
historian Howard Zinn put it,
that soon,
"met with the full force of the capitalist
state".
The U.S. Attorney General won a court order to
stop the strike, but the union and its leader, Eugene V. Debs,
refused to quit.
President Grover Cleveland, over the
objections of Illinois' governor, ordered federal troops to Chicago under
the pretense of maintaining public safety. Soldiers fired their bayoneted
rifles into the crowd of 5,000, killing 13 strike sympathizers.
Seven hundred, including Debs, were arrested.
Debs wasn't a socialist before the strike, but he was after.
The event radicalized him.
"In the gleam of every bayonet and the flash
of every rifle," Debs
said later on, "the class struggle was revealed".
I imagine a similar revelation for the tens of
thousands of Americans who participated in last fall's Occupy Wall Street
protests. As you know, the movement began in New York City and spread
quickly, inspiring activists in the biggest cities and the smallest hamlets.
Outraged by the broken promise of the U.S. and
inspired by democratic revolts of Egypt and Tunisia, they assembled to
protest economic injustice and corrupt corporate power in Washington.

- Attacking the unions
Yet the harder they pushed, the harder they were pushed back - with
violence.
Protesters met with police wearing body armor,
face shields, helmets and batons; police legally undermined Americans' right
to assemble freely with "non-lethal" weaponry like tear gas, rubber bullets
and sonic grenades.
There was no need for the president to call in
the army. An army, as Mayor Bloomberg
quipped, was already there.
Before Occupy Wall Street, many protesters were middle- and upper-middle
class college graduates who could safely assume the constitutional guarantee
of their civil liberties. But afterward, not so much. Something like scales
fell from their eyes, and when they arose anew, they had been baptized by
the fire of political violence.
Income inequality isn't just about justice; it's about freedom, too.
One view of freedom minimizes the state's role
in an individual's life and maximizes markets so that individuals are free
to risk whatever they want to risk to be whatever they want to be. Another
view sees the obligation of the state to hedge against the risk of the
marketplace so that individuals can feel secure enough to be what they want
to be.
Obviously, the libertarian view favors someone who can afford risk; the
socialist view favors someone who can't. One view has confidence in the
market while the other is skeptical. One view sees income inequality as
natural while the other sees it as politically oppressive.
Emmanuel Saez, an economist from UC Berkeley, tried to quantify that
oppression. He found that during the first year of the recovery from the
2008 crisis
93 per cent of incomes gains went to the 1 per cent.
"Top 1 per cent incomes grew by 11.6 per
cent, while bottom 99 per cent incomes grew only by 0.2 per cent," he
said in an update of a previous study.
"...Such an uneven recovery can help explain
the recent public demonstrations against inequality."
Moreover, income for the 99 per cent grew by 20
per cent from 1993-2000, but during the Bush years, it grew by only 6.8 per
cent.
It's worth saying again that this is not a
natural occurrence of the free and open marketplace. The upward
redistribution of wealth is the concrete result of politics and policy - one
might even say
socialism for the rich, capitalism for everyone else.
Or should I say authoritarianism for everyone else.
Since the
terrorist
attacks of 2001, the U.S. has spent about $635bn to militarize the country's
local police forces. It's ostensibly an effort to better prepare communities
in case of another attack.
But, as Stephan Salisbury
reported
recently, there has been a cultural transformation, too.
"The truth is that virtually the entire
apparatus of government has been mobilized and militarized right down to
the university campus."
When the state makes a fetish of security, as
the U.S. has, it becomes hard to tell the difference between acts of civil
disobedience and terrorism.

Occupy Wall Street protests
So it's tempting to say two currents conspired to increasingly limit the
freedom of individuals in the land of the free.
One is the funneling of wealth upward so that
the top 10 per cent owns and controls half the wealth. The other is the
organizing of state violence to protect the oligarchy in case anyone gets
wise to what's happening.
Perhaps there's a third:
the executing of state
violence in the name of security.
These collided in an instant in November.
New York City cops, under the orders of
a
billionaire mayor to clear out Zuccotti Park, suppressed the rights of
thousands of Americans who had been protesting the oligarchy's power over
their lives.
Later on, it was revealed that the real estate firm that owned
the park had previously taken more than $174.5 million in tax-payer
subsidies to rebuild after September 11.
Not only was the state reacting to the threat of
collective action; it was defrauding the public of its contractual right to
use the park after having paid for it.
Given all this, I sense the depth of Zinn's line about,
"the full-force of the capitalist state".
Occupy protesters aren't just facing local
police; they are facing an entire system bent on breaking dissent and
protecting the status quo.
And I sense this is why
Eugene Debs became a
radical after experiencing such political violence. How can you play by the
rules when the 1 per cent writes, and keeps rewriting, the rules? The only
way to fight back is to fight back against the entire system.
In 1918, Debs visited three socialists in jail for dodging the World War I
draft. Afterward, he walked across the street to give an impromptu speech
that enraptured onlookers for hours.
Because of this speech, Debs was eventually
found guilty of violating the Espionage Act, a deeply un-American set of
laws that are still in effect (in fact,
the Obama administration is using
the laws against Bradley Manning, who
leaked secrets to WikiLeaks). These
laws are designed to crush criticism of the state.
The irony of Debs' time may be the irony of
ours:
"They tell us we live in this great free
republic; that our institutions are democratic; that we are a free and
self-governing people," Debs said to his audience.
"That is too much, even for a joke."
