At the very top of the power structures of this planet lies an esoteric
realm where a very few people find themselves with great power in their
hands and 'nobody above them' to give them commands.
Such a situation causes insanity in those too weak and too greedy to take
the responsibility. Such is the case with the people who have ruled Western
civilization since the end of World War Two. They were greedy gangsters
drunk with enough power-lust to grab the reins of control but had not the
wisdom to rule a planet.
Their time is coming to an end.
The reason for this is simple:
they made the mistake of many fallen empires
past; their power was built in debt.
People who follow the daily news grind,
especially the news addicts to saturate themselves with information every
day, often are blinded by detail and cannot see the big picture.
They are like fish swimming about a pond that
has been isolated from the main river. They worry about their daily food but
fail to realize the dry season has come and their pond will dry.
The situation in the West is as follows:
for decades many countries, notably the US,
the Mediterranean European countries, England, France and a few others
were receiving ships full of goods from the rest of the world and sent
them back empty. In exchange they sent out
IOUs. The big mistake they made was to
think these IOUs were 'real money.'
They thought that all the money being lent to
them was inflows of capital, and that by using other peoples money they
could move into the post-industrial financial services economy.
The hubris of leaders of the West, concentrated in,
...has proven to be their downfall.
Their big plans for world conquest and a fascist
world government or Fourth Reich headed by them were to be financed
by the people they intended to kill and subjugate.
Their big plan was to,
-
grab the oil of the Middle East and
Central Asia
-
consolidate control over the Muslim
world
-
then use Russia, Japan, NATO, Taiwan and
India to crush China
The Chinese, of course, were supposed to just
shut up and finance all of this.
The Chinese wisely (and obviously) said no to
all this and started spending their money on anything but the military
industrial mass murder complex. That is why suddenly everybody started
bowing to China.
They never forgot the Golden rule,
he who controls the gold, makes the rules.
The news addicts worry about the raising of the
debt ceiling in
Washington D.C.
while forgetting that this is an annual public show that has nothing
to do with the underlying reality.
The reality is a series of high profile
meetings, punctuated by threats and begging to get foreigners to continue to
finance the fascist rogue corporate regime that took over what used to be
the Democratic United States of America.
The
Federal Reserve Board can print dollars all they want but the
rest of the world is no longer accepting dollar printed in the US unless
there is something real to back them. This is the reality the corporate news
cartel is trying so desperately to hide.
There is another huge story they are trying to hide, the story of Chinas
gold.
In 1938 the Nationalist Government of China sent
7 US warships full of Gold to the US for safekeeping. They were given
60-year US government bonds in exchange. After the 60 years ended, the US
was supposed to give the gold back to China. In other words, the Americans
were supposed to give back the gold in 1998.
When they did not, the Chinese owners of the gold sued the Federal Reserve
Board at the International Court of Justice at the Hague.
The Americans argued that when Nixon delinked
the US dollar from gold in 1971, they gave the gold back to China. What he
was referring to was the fact that Nixon gave Chairman Maos government 200
tons of gold in exchange for a promise by China not to make any moves in
Asia for 50 years, or until 2021.
The US lawyers said that by giving gold to the
communist government of China, they no longer owed gold to Taiwan. The court
ruled otherwise.
The first shipment of gold was supposed to be returned to the rightful
Chinese owners on September 12th, 2001. Instead, the American
criminal regime took the gold to California (and thense [thence or then] to
Paraguay) and
blew up the World Trade Center to hide their crimes.
They were basically giving the finger to world
civilized society.
For a while they were able to buy time by building up a vast military
machine and by playing off the various Chinese factions against each other.
However, bit by bit the criminal US regime became isolated from world power.
They lost Russia to Putin. Japan made a secret
decision to stop handing over money. The Chinese factions began to unite.
The Middle Eastern regimes began to decouple oil
from American made dollars. Colonel Khadafy told the Europeans to stop
paying for oil with debt. The British Empire split from the rogue US regime.
So now, the White Dragon Foundation [WDF] is offering to take some of
the trillion dollar Chinese gold-backed cheques issued by Federal Reserve
Board and cash them.
-
They wish to use this money to finance a
swords-to-plowshares transition of the military industrial complex
-
They wish to finance vast projects to
turn the deserts green and replenish the oceans with fish
-
They wish to end poverty
Once the planet stops bleeding, the WDF would
like to finance things like,
