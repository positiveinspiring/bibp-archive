Open Letter to Barack Obama
Million Fax on Washington

Dear Mr. President Elect:
On October 17, 2008 PRG published an open letter to the candidates
calling for them to make preparations to end the six-decade truth
embargo regarding an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race.
This letter reiterates that request.
Your staff is now aware that letters, faxes and emails are arriving at
your former Senate office and the Washington, DC transition
headquarters. In general this correspondence will ask of you the
following:
-
demand a full briefing from your
military services and intelligence agencies regarding what they
know and what they are doing about
extraterrestrial related phenomena.
If you are told you do not have the proper clearance for this
information, replace that person with someone who has read the
Constitution.
-
press for open and comprehensive
congressional hearings to take testimony from scores of
government witnesses who have already come forward with
extraordinary evidence and are prepared to testify under oath.
-
formally acknowledge the
extraterrestrial presence and
finally end the truth embargo after 61 years.
-
make available for open development
technologies which have been
secretly studied and reverse engineered
for decades with unlimited black budget funding. These
technologies are derived from extraterrestrial vehicles and are
now essential to overcome the environmental, economic and
societal challenges of our time.
PRG is well aware of your intention
to launch a high technology New Deal code named New
Apollo Project to restore Americas economy. This massive
program to subsidize green technology development, create jobs, expand
the manufacturing base and reverse the trade imbalance will be likely
accompanied by legislation prohibiting overseas hiring and offshore
manufacturing.
All well and good, but it will not be enough. The challenges are too
great and the response to these challenges too long delayed. It is
essential the paradigm breaking technologies hidden in unacknowledged
special access programs and sequestered behind the extraterrestrial
truth embargo be included.
If you are in need of counsel to assist you in these matters, you have
but to turn to your transition co-chair, John Podesta. His
efforts to end the truth embargo and release all relevant government
documents date back to at least 1993 and
the Rockefeller
Initiative. PRG believes he is fully aware of the
extraterrestrial presence and is committed to creating more open,
transparent governance.
In this he is in sync with the chief
financial backer of his
Center for American Progress think
tank,
George Soros.
Reach out to your partys allies within the military services and
intelligence agencies. When you take office conduct the necessary
meetings with the cross agency committees managing the
extraterrestrial presence issue.
In the spring of 2009, before the truth
embargo becomes your embargo, initiate the most profound event in human
history and begin rebuilding the trust of the American people in their
government and the standing of your country in the world.
Respectfully,
Stephen Bassett
Executive Director
