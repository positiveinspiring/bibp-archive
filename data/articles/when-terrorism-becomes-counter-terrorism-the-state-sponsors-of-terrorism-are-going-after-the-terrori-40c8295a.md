# When Terrorism Becomes Counter-Terrorism - The State Sponsors of 
Terrorism are "Going After the Terrorists"

US foreign policy has
nurtured Al Qaeda,
a creation of the CIA for
more than 35 years,
with the support of
Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI)
and Saudi Arabia's
infamous General Intelligence Presidency (GIP).
Lest we forget Osama bin
Laden
was recruited in 1979 by
the CIA
at the outset of the
Soviet-Afghan war.
A complex network of Al
Qaeda affiliated terrorist organizations
overseen by US and allied
intelligence agencies
has unfolded, extending
across the Middle East,
North Africa, sub-Saharan
Africa, Central Asia,
Western China, South and
South East Asia.
Rand Corporation Report 2012
While mainstream analysis regarding
CIA covert support of "jihadist" terrorist entities is a taboo,
the Western media (quoting expert opinion) will often place the
blame on the intelligence agencies of America's closest allies
including Pakistan's ISI and Saudi Arabia's GIP, i.e. for
supporting terrorist entities (in defiance of the US).
According to the Rand Corporation:
"Pakistan poses a particular
challenge. As America's relationship with Pakistan
deteriorates, how long will the United States be able to
pressure a state whose intelligence service [i.e Pakistan's
ISI which is in close liaison with the CIA] has ties with
some of al Qaeda's allies, such as the Haqqani network and
Lashkar-e-Taiba?"

The Islamic
State Caliphate: A Project of US Intelligence
Today's Al Qaeda most recent
"affiliate", the Islamic
State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) based in Raqqa,
Northern Syria is not only protected by the US and its allies,
it is trained and financed by US-NATO, with the support of
Turkey, Israel and Washington's Persian Gulf allies.
In a bitter irony, the caliphate
project as an instrument of propaganda has been on the drawing
board of US intelligence for more than ten years.
In December
2004, under the
Bush Administration, the
National Intelligence
Council (NIC) predicted that in the year 2020 a New Caliphate
extending from the Mediterranean to Central Asia and South East
Asia would emerge, threatening Western democracy and Western
values.
The "findings" of the
National Intelligence Council were published in a 123 page
unclassified report entitled "Global
Trends 2020 - Mapping The Global Future".
"A New Caliphate provides an
example of how a global movement fueled by radical
religious identity politics could
constitute a challenge to Western norms and values as
the foundation of the global system".
The NIC 2004 report borders
on ridicule; it is devoid of intelligence, let alone
historical and geopolitical analysis. It has the features of
an internal propaganda construct intended to sensitize
government officials.
Its objective is to provide a
justification to America's "Global War on Terrorism" (GWOT).

the Global Future". NIC 2020 Project
Nonetheless, it also confirms
the contour of a diabolical military-intelligence agenda
with new "jihadist" terror brigades (largely integrated by
mercenaries) emerging in numerous geographical locations
(Eurasia and Africa - map above).
This agenda of creating a new
"jihad" was confirmed by a Debka File (Israeli
intelligence and security news) report in August 2011:
NATO headquarters in Brussels and the
Turkish high command are
meanwhile drawing up plans for their first military step
in Syria, which is to arm the rebels with weapons
Also discussed in Brussels
and Ankara, our sources report, is a
campaign to enlist thousands of Muslim volunteers in
Middle East countries and the Muslim world to
fight alongside the Syrian rebels.
The Turkish army would
house these volunteers, train them and secure their
passage into Syria.
(DEBKAfile,
NATO
to give rebels anti-tank weapons, August 14, 2011)
This report (published 4 years
ago) confirms what today has become glaringly obvious,
namely the central role of the Turkish government and
military in liaison with NATO as a "State sponsor of
terrorism".
"U Turn"
The
State of Sponsors of Terrorism Engage in Counterterrorism.
The Role of Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Pakistan
And now in an unusual about turn,
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has configured a coalition of
34 mainly Muslim countries "to go after the Islamic state".
In a bitter irony, the key
protagonists of this counterterrorism initiative endorsed by the
"international community" are Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Turkey,
i.e. countries which have relentlessly supported "Islamic
terrorism" from the very outset in close liaison with
Washington.
In the words of Hillary Clinton
in her declassified Emails:
"donors in Saudi Arabia
constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni
terrorist groups worldwide."
Counter terrorism by the state
sponsors of terrorism? A New Normal? The propaganda campaign
appears to have reached an impasse.
According to the official statement:
"The countries here mentioned
have decided on the formation of a military alliance led by
Saudi Arabia to fight terrorism, with a joint operations
centre based in Riyadh to co-ordinate and support military
operations,"
Arab News
December 2015
This "military alliance" will work
in liaison with Obama's counter-terrorism bombing campaign
involving a coalition of some 20 countries initiated against the
Islamic State in August-September 2014.
The evidence, however, confirms that
the bombing raids have avoided targeting the ISIL, which is
integrated by mercenaries including special forces, who are in
permanent liaison with US-NATO.
Screen shot,
Daily Mail
KSA Defense Minister Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman, confirmed (December 14, 2015) that the
campaign,
"would co-ordinate efforts to
fight terrorism" specifically in Iraq and Syria in
coordination "with major powers and international
organisations", i.e NATO, the US, the EU.
In an unusual twist, the State
sponsors of terrorism are now indulging in counterterrorism.
The Islamic State in the
Arabian peninsula, namely the House of Saud which is
predicated on the tenets of Wahhabism is going after
the Islamic
State (ISIL) in Northern Syria.
Known and documented, Saudi Arabia
has played a key strategic role in promoting and financing
terrorism on behalf of Washington. Moreover, Saudi weapons
purchases from the US and Canada are also being used to equip
and arm various "opposition" rebel groups in Syria including the
ISIL and Al Nusrah.
It is worth noting:
recruited by America's ally, a
large number of ISIS mercenaries are convicted criminals released
from Saudi prisons on condition they join the ISIL. Saudi
death row inmates were recruited to join the terror
brigades.

Britain, France and the US have
welcomed the Saudi initiative. John Kerry says it is
constructive. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon
unequivocally praised Saudi Arabia "for its constructive
efforts and leadership".
It's a theater
of the absurd...
It's like asking Al Capone to lead a
coalition of Chicago criminal syndicates to go after organized
crime. In this case, the criminal syndicate based in Riyadh is
acting on behalf of its Western sponsors.
And the media applauds in
chorus without acknowledging several of their own reports which
confirm that Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan, Qatar, Jordan, et
al. have been involved in recruiting, training and financing
Islamic terrorists. The practice of beheading civilians by ISIS
operative in Syria emanates from Saudi Arabia.
In the words of an earlier
Daily Telegraph report (April 2014):
"We should not be blind to the
fact that there is a project out there to destroy [Syria's]
rich, pluralist, and unbelievably intricate culture and
replace it with a monochrome version of Wahhabi Islam".
What the mainstream media invariably
fails to mention is that Saudi Arabia is a "go-between" and that
Wahhabi Islam is being used and applied by Washington.
In turn, the public is led to
believe that this is a bona fide war of religion and that
Muslims are waging war against Western civilization.
This "version of Wahhabism" has
nothing to with Islam, it's "Made in America", its a diabolical
tool of US foreign policy, which consists in applying and
manipulating the ideology of
Wahhabism as a means of recruiting
and indoctrinating terrorists to wage a "jihad" on behalf of
Uncle Sam.
US-NATO's war without borders goes
unnoticed; World public opinion is led to believe that Islam is
waging a war against the West and that US-NATO are acting in
"self-defense" against an elusive outside enemy based in the
Middle East.
Politicians, journalists and
intelligence analysts are lying to themselves. Everybody knows
that Saudi Arabia and Turkey are behind the terrorists and we
also know that the US is behind Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
The US is the main architect of this
terrorist undertaking which consists in sponsoring terrorists
with a view to destabilizing and destroying sovereign countries
in defiance of international law.
In 2013,
the European Parliament published a detailed report (excerpt
below) confirming the role of Saudi Arabia in spreading
Wahhabi-Salafist ideology to terror groups in a large number of
countries.
The report, however, failed to
acknowledge that these actions were conducted as part of a US
foreign policy and intelligence agenda. (Excerpt - screenshot -
