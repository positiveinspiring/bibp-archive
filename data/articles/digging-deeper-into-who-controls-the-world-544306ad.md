As we delve deeper into world control, more information arises that helps us
understand the current global situation.
Many people are unaware of the
interconnectedness between the largest global companies.
Eighty percent of the world's wealth appears to be earned by a "core" of
1,318 corporations, which in turn are being controlled by only 147
companies.
Seventy-five percent of these companies are financial
institutions - and the top companies on the list are the Federal Reserve
banks.
The
Federal Reserve created 26 to 29
trillion dollars' worth of bailouts for their own companies between 2007
and 2010. This was revealed in their own audit statements, and confirmed
by United States Congressmen and prominent financial analysts.

Please note that the Federal Reserve,
created in 1913, is a private corporation controlled by international
bankers.

Anytime the Fed prints money-Federal Reserve
Notes, the American taxpayer is charged interest on the amount printed.
Alan
Greenspan admitted that,
the Federal Reserve is an independent
agency... there is no other agency of government who can overrule
actions we take.
As they understood the extreme dangers to our
life and liberty, our founding fathers were adamantly opposed to a central
privately controlled bank.
This global control occurs in multiple ways:
-
Different companies having the same
board members (this also includes members of the same family who may
be on different boards).
-
The ongoing movement between government
leaders into private sector executive/board positions or lobbying
positions for companies they formerly regulated and visa versa (Tim
Geithner - former New York Federal Reserve Bank President becomes
Obama administrations Treasury Secretary).
-
Stock or bonds held in other companies
(Goldman considering keeping majority of Facebook shares in Initial
Public Stock Offering).
-
The division of competing brand names
owned by the same company (Proctor and Gamble).
-
Funding through private foundations for
various associations (The American Medical Association since 1910
and National Education Association are heavily funded by the
Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations. Hmmm... helpful when you want
to control public health and education).
-
The ease with which those in power move
between the fewer and fewer global companies and political offices.
The majority of radio, television and large
Internet companies has become concentrated into the hands of just few
companies.
Fifty independent companies once comprised
the media as of 1983.
Now,
-
Time Warner-CNN/TBS/TNT/AOL/Fortune/People
-
News Corp-Fox/New York Post/Wall Street Journal/MarketWatch.com
-
Walt
Disney-ABC/ESPN/Miramax/Pixar
-
Bertelsmann-Most EU stations/Random
House/National Geographic magazines
-
Viacom-CBS-Simon & Schuster/Comedy
Central/BET/Paramount
-
GE-NBC/Telemundo/MSNBC/,
...decide what is news.

Such consolidation creates the ability to easily
manipulate the masses via television, radio and printed media.
This includes global news, political
information, science, health and social values - which we have all seen go
down the toilet.
The desensitization to dead bodies, increasing
violence, glorification of anti-social behavior, i.e. the ones doing the
most lying/cheating/stealing are the winners; the invasive surveillance
systems to acclimate the public to a complete loss of privacy, and the lack
of unbiased, actual reporting on critical events.
As a result, the NDAA, SOPA and PIPA legislation have all had a positive
slant on them in
Mainstream Media.
The NDAA wipes out the 4th Amendment right to
due process; and the latter two proposed laws remove our free access to
websites, giving the government the right to take down Internet sites at
will.
Thus, their interests seem to be solely in
maximizing their profits no matter the detrimental effects on the
environmental, social and health of all life. All the while maintaining
control of the global population through massive manipulation.
These few controlling global companies have financial interests in
non-renewable energy industry and
pharmaceutical companies.
An example being
that the latest information on the
BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the
Japanese Fukushima nuclear meltdowns reveal initial disinformation of the
actual extent of these catastrophic events.
Here in Texas, the ads run by the natural gas
drilling companies purporting to protect the water supply are a good
example of test results being ignored. Especially when tap water, stock
tanks, and ground water continue to show contamination of toxic,
cancer-causing chemicals used in
the fracking process.
So where is the FCCs truth in advertising
policy being enforced? Many of the so called news stories about new drugs
or new types of medical testing or equipment are actually produced by the
companies who are selling these drugs, tests and equipment. And they also
influence the health profession directly (this source shows payments made
to doctors and health professionals for drug promotions. The amount for
Texas is over $59 million dollars.)
Politics has become blatantly corrupted and immoral.
So, as long as it suits a Super PAC (Political
Action Committee) agenda, there are zero limits as to the validity of their
ads for their candidate. The Supreme Court January 21st, 2010 decision on
the
Citizens United versus the Federal Election Commission, gave
corporations, legal entities with no human attributes, the same
constitutional free speech rights as humans. (Thirty years ago, this Court
ruled that spending money is a part of free speech.)
This ruling overturned the part of the
McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform that prohibited corporate- and
union-funded campaign advertising within 90 days of an election.
Montanas Supreme Court restored their state's 100-year-old ban on direct
corporate spending on January 12, 2012.
This will force a revisit of this matter back to
the Federal Supreme Court. Speaking of elections, did anyone happen to hear
that a Barcelona, Spain company Scytl/SOE Software operates as
ClarityElections.com and reports election results in over 525 jurisdictions
through one access point. (Thank you Mark for the link to
Black Box Voting).
Unless you consider the Supreme Court,
-
appointing
a President
-
replacing computer equipment to modify results
-
or even a
hacker changing votes, as viable,
...these untraceable ballots are
unconstitutional, as we are guaranteed the right to audit election results.
Smoke and mirrors are in constant use to confuse, create fear, and to
manipulate the masses.
Using fear is the basis for starting conflicts
between groups. The us against them divide-and-conquer mentality has
worked for millennia.
Whether it is,
-
religious contention (most religions are
based in 'love')
-
politics (political parties are funded by global interests
see
Follow the Money or
Open Secrets)
-
science vs. nature (Bill Gates
saying that 'GMO crops will feed the world'),
...it is all about the 147s global
control of people, resources, countries and wealth.
It is up to us.
There are many people working diligently to
restore our Constitution and Bill of Rights and world freedoms - people with
integrity, including those who took the oath to uphold our Constitution.
They are many, and the key is to understand that they are for the people. We
must be extremely observant about how the 147 will use the media in their
final attempt to retain their devastating reign on America and the world.
Again, it is up to us to look fearlessly beyond
the mirrors and smoke for the truth. Those restoring the Constitution and
our freedoms need our support. We must be courageous and strong as we return
America, and the world, to we the people.
Remember, it is our active choices that determine who we are as a people.
