It turns out that the poster child for the
European debt crisis is not actually poor at all. In fact, the truth is that
the nation of Greece is sitting on absolutely massive untapped reserves of
gold, oil and natural gas.
If the Greeks were to fully exploit the natural
resources that are literally right under their feet, they would no longer
have any debt problems. Fortunately, this recent economic crisis has spurred
them to action and it is now being projected that Greece will be the number
one gold producer in Europe by 2016. In addition, Greece is now opening up
exploration of their massive oil and natural gas deposits.
Reportedly, Greece is sitting on hundreds of
millions of barrels of oil and gigantic natural gas deposits that are worth
trillions of dollars.
It is truly sad that Greece should be
one of the wealthiest nations in all of Europe but instead the country is
going through the worst economic depression that it has experienced in
modern history.
It is kind of like a homeless man that sleeps on
the streets every night without realizing that a relative has left him an
inheritance worth millions of dollars. Greece is not poor at all, and
hopefully the people of Greece can learn the truth about all of this wealth
and chart a course out of this current mess.
I have written extensively about the nightmarish
economic conditions that Greece is experiencing right now.

Since the depression began in Greece, the Greek
economy has contracted by more than 20 percent. In April 2010, the
unemployment rate in Greece was only 11.8 percent. Since then it has
skyrocketed to 25.1 percent.
The government debt to GDP ratio in Greece is
projected to hit
198 percent this year, and there are persistent rumors that Greece will
be forced to leave the euro.
But all of this is completely and totally
unnecessary. Greece is not actually poor at all. In fact, after you account
for untapped natural resources, Greece is actually one of the wealthiest
nations in all of Europe.
According to
Bloomberg, there is a massive amount of gold in Greece.
This recent economic crisis has accelerated the
approval of mining activity, and it is now being projected that Greece will
soon be the
number one gold producing country in all of Europe...
Gold mining
is gathering momentum after Greece began what it called a fast-track
approvals program.
The Canadian
and Australian companies said their projects will add about 425,000
ounces by 2016, worth $757 million at the Oct. 5 spot price, to the
16,000 ounces the country produced in 2011.
Theres
clearly evidence that Greece has woken up to the potential of their
mining industry, said Jeremy Wrathall, chairman of Perth-based
Glory Resources. Politicians increasingly realize that a pro-mining
stance is appropriate due to job creation potential.
Greece, which
is also fast-tracking state property sales, is set to overtake Finland
as the continents largest gold producer within four years, as
regulators in Athens sign off on mines kept on hold for more than a
decade by red tape and environmental rules.
But Greece doesn't just have gold.
Greece is also swimming in oil and natural gas.
It turns out that Greece is sitting on the western edge of an absolutely
mammoth sub-Mediterranean oil and gas field, and there are also huge
deposits of oil and natural gas in the western parts of the country.
A
Reuters article back in July discussed how foreign firms are now rushing
to exploit these tremendous resources...
Greece has
received eight bids by companies to search for oil and natural gas in
three blocks in the western part of the country, the energy ministry
said on Monday, as debt-laden Athens seeks to save money on energy
imports.
Greece, which
produces almost no oil or natural gas, aims to develop potential
hydrocarbon reserves as part of an effort to overhaul its economy and
lessen dependence on energy imports.
So exactly how much oil and natural gas does
Greece have? The numbers that are being reported so far are staggering.
The following comes from a
Greek news source...
Until now the
offers for hydrocarbon exploration have concerned three blocks: The
first is in the Gulf of Patra, the second off the coast of Katakolo -
both in Western Greece - and the third at Ioannina, northwestern Greece.
Early
estimates suggest that the Gulf of Patra may have 200 million barrels of
crude oil, and that there are another 80 million at Ioannina and nearly
3 million off the coast of Katokolo.
Furthermore,
according to the United States Geological Survey, in the sea between
Crete, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt, there are about 15 trillion cubic
meters of natural gas and oil just waiting to be extracted.
The truth is that Greece has enough oil and
natural gas to be able to pay off all of their debts. The value of the
natural gas that they are sitting on alone has been estimated to be worth
trillions of dollars.
The following is from an article earlier this
year by
F. William Engdahl...
In December
2010, as it seemed the Greek crisis might still be resolved without the
by-now huge bailouts or privatizations, Greeces Energy Ministry formed
a special group of experts to research the prospects for oil and gas in
Greek waters.
Greeces
Energean Oil & Gas began increased investment into drilling in the
offshore waters after a successful smaller oil discovery in 2009.
Major
geological surveys were made. Preliminary estimates now are that total
offshore oil in Greek waters exceeds 22 billion barrels in the Ionian
Sea off western Greece and some 4 billion barrels in the northern Aegean
Sea.
The southern
Aegean Sea and Cretan Sea are yet to be explored, so the numbers could
be significantly higher. An earlier Greek National Council for Energy
Policy report stated that,
Greece
is one of the least explored countries in Europe regarding
hydrocarbon (oil and gas-w.e.) potentials.
According to
one Greek analyst, Aristotle Vassilakis,
surveys
already done that have measured the amount of natural gas estimate
it to reach some nine trillion dollars.
Even if only
a fraction of that is available, it would transform the finances of
Greece and the entire region.
Tulane
University oil expert David Hynes told an audience in Athens recently
that Greece could potentially solve its entire public debt crisis
through development of its new-found gas and oil.
He
conservatively estimates that exploitation of the reserves already
discovered could bring the country more than 302 billion over 25 years.
So unlike several other nations in Europe,
things actually look quite promising for Greece in the years ahead if they
manage their resources correctly and don't let foreigners come in and steal
all of their wealth.
And perhaps this is why there is such hesitation
to boot Greece out of the EU. It seems probable that many of the top
politicians in Europe know about all of this gold, oil and natural gas that
Greece is sitting on.
Hopefully the people of Greece will learn about
this massive amount of wealth that is just under their feet.
If they can figure out a way to get this wealth
to start to flow into the hands of the people of Greece, a lot of their
problems could be solved rather quickly and they could start to experience a
massive economic turnaround.
