Dedication
This book is dedicated to the two million
Americans and counting who have been programmed with Monarch-type
trauma-based mind control. This book is written to destroy trauma-based
mind control before it destroys the human race. Its time for this
horrendous secret to end. It is also written as part of Gods end time
work to propel people of faith to the high calling that is prophesied of
the Body, but cannot be attained without men of faith understanding
these things. Humanitys great prophet said he came to heal those whose
hearts had been broken-- literally split and crushed, and to free those
who are captive. That work needs to go forward.
Blood, sweat and tears are associated with this book. The blood of the
innocent victims of this mind-control cries out in a single unison,
along with the pungent sweat of those who have tried to minister help to
the shattered humanity left by the sadistic programmers, and the pools
of tears shed as this book was written, "How long, O Lord, holy and
true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on earth?"
WARNING, READ THIS FIRST BEFORE READING THE BOOK:
IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE you the reader have
had mind-control done to you, you must consider the following book to be
DANGEROUS. If you are consulting a therapist for DID (also known as MPD),
it is recommended that you consult your therapist before reading this
book. The complications that could result for those under mind control
learning the truth--could be fatal. The co-authors take no
responsibility for those who read or misuse this information.
The readers mind is like a garden. It may not be time to plant the
truth in your mind. Perhaps you need some weeding or ground preparation,
before the garden of your mind is ready. Perhaps the weather is too
stormy to plant the truth. Pray to the Lord of the Harvest. The
blessings that flow from planting the information of this book in your
mind will require the presence of living waters of love. If you do not
have love in your heart, this book is not for you. The information
contained in this book is the biggest news-story of the 20th century,
and still the biggest secret. It will challenge you, shock you, horrify
you and hopefully motivate you to redouble your efforts to humble
yourself and seek strength from God Almighty.
The programming procedures, which are described in this book, are based
on research and consultation with deprogrammers, exprogrammers,
therapists, counselors and pertinent literature. To the best of our
knowledge the statements made in this book are factual, although they
may not reflect the latest or currently accepted methodology among each
and every faction of the
New World Order, which carries out Monarch-type
programming. This book tends to devote more emphasis to Illuminati
programming, which is the highest level of programming. For individual
application in understanding a survivor of Monarch programming,
therapists are admonished to use this material with consideration for
the Monarch victims personal case and situation. The authors disclaim
any responsibility for therapeutic work based upon this material.
Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler have co-authored They
Know Not What They Do, An Illustrated Guidebook To Monarch Mind Control.
Both Fritz and Cisco bring years of experience in dealing with Monarch
programming to bear on the writing of this book. Fritz has researched
the Illuminati, while he has worked with victims of its programming. He
has authored
The Top 13 Illuminati Families, and
several other books.
