# Brazil's Neighbors Warn of President's 'Dangerous' Ouster - But U.S. 
Press Isn't Listening

The effort to oust
twice-elected Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff
has been big news in the United States.
Since December 2015, when
Brazil's Chamber of Deputies began an
impeachment process over Rousseff's budget
maneuvers, the New York
Times has had 74 pieces that mention "Rousseff"
and "impeachment," according to the Nexis news database;
the Washington Post
has had 138 such stories.
But something that hasn't
been big news in US corporate media has been the
reaction from Brazil's neighbors to Rousseff's
suspension pending a Senate trial.
While some Latin American
governments were supportive - notably, newly
right-governed Argentina said it "respects the
institutional process" in Brazil, while close US ally
Colombia,
"trusts in the
preservation of democratic institutionality and
stability" - several others were harshly critical.
Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega called Rousseff's removal an,
"anti-democratic process
that has cast a shadow on the reliability and
strength of institutions."
Bolivia's Foreign ministry
said Rousseff's opponents were trying to,
"destabilize democratic
processes and ignore the will of the people
expressed in the popular vote."
Three Latin American
countries -
Venezuela and
El Salvador on May 14, and
Ecuador today, May 18 - announced they were
recalling their ambassadors from Brazil, one of the
strongest expressions of disapproval a nation can take.
Salvadoran President
Sanchez Ceren
said he would not recognize the government formed by
Vice President Michel Temer after Rousseff's removal.
"We respect democracy
and the people's will," Ceren said. "In Brazil an
act was done that was once done through
military coups."
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro
labeled Rousseff's ouster a "coup," calling it,
"a grave and dangerous
sign for the future stability and peace of all
the continent."
The region's major
multilateral organizations have also been critical of
Brazil's process.
Secretary General Ernesto
Samper of the Union of South American Nations,
representing the continent's 12 nations,
called Rousseff the,
"legitimate leader" of
Brazil. Samper, the former president of Colombia,
said the attempt to remove her was "compromising
the democratic governability of the region in a
dangerous way."
Prior to Rousseff's ouster,
Secretary General Luis Almagro of the Organization of
American States
released a strong statement:
Our Organization has
made a detailed analysis of the impeachment process
against Dilma, and has concluded that it does not
fit within the rules that govern this process.
There is no criminal
accusation against the president; rather she has
been accused of the poor administration of public
resources in 2014. This is an accusation that is
political in character, and that does not merit an
impeachment process.
A Nexis search turns up no
US newspaper that reported on the recall of the
Venezuelan or Salvadoran ambassadors - and
Google News
shows no US coverage today of Ecuador's move.
Samper's comments do not
seem to have been covered by any US paper. Almagro's
statement wasn't quoted by any US papers, though his
criticism was briefly alluded to in a handful of stories
(New York Times,
4/14/16; LA Times,
4/16/16;
Washington Post, 5/12/16).
These omissions are perhaps
not surprising, given that most US news coverage of
Latin America is strongly guided by the attitudes of the
US government. And Washington seems amenable to regime
change via legislative action for leftist governments in
Latin America:
After Honduran lawmakers
ousted President Manuel Zelaya, then-Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton worked for international
recognition of the coup regime, as her published
emails
revealed.
Questions have also been
raised about a US role in the legislative
overthrow of Paraguay's President Fernando Lugo.
If the US government is
happy with legislatures overthrowing presidents in Latin
America, most US journalists will not go out of their
way to indicate that not everyone in the region
is celebrating.
One of the few articles in a
major US paper to cover the reaction of Latin America to
Roussef's ouster as a story in itself appeared in
USA Today (5/12/16).
Coming out before any
ambassadors had been withdrawn, it had a classic
here's-what-you-should-think headline:
Leftist Leaders Leap to
Defense of Ousted Brazilian President
People who work for an
industry that so predictably suppresses news that's
unfavorable to the official narrative maybe shouldn't be
so quick to mock others for "leaping."
