Tweetstorm

However, if you
ask him, he'll tell you he's a journalist who
believes governments should be held accountable for their
actions. And in his latest Twitter rant,
you'll see why.
He takes on his
critics and those who want him dead, head on.
In his first
tweet on Thursday, Assange addressed the latest accusation that
he's a pedophile.
He linked a
CNN video clip and tweeted,
"On CNN
former CIA claims that I am a 'pedophile.' Quality work from
the folks that gave us Iraq, Libya.."
Thus implying
the CIA is largely responsible for the proxy wars taking place
in the Middle East and Northern Africa.
The video
segment showed Phil Mudd, a former CIA analyst, claiming Assange
is a pedophile who's holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy and
said, "he's not credible."
Unfortunately
for Mudd, most Americans believe Assange is credible after
publishing leaked documents from several sources within the U.S.
government who refused to go along with the government's
narratives.
In fact, even the current sitting president claimed
on the campaign last year that he "loves Wikileaks."
Exposing the
mainstream media's bias toward him, Assange then tweeted,
"Sun
newspaper stated that I raped two men then apparently
invented a fake journalist to put on the byline."
Indeed, the
article does purport to show that a reporter by the name of
Holly Christodoulou published the article.
But when
reporters confronted The Sun on the story's apparent
inaccuracies, the newspaper then changed the story as well as
the author's name.
"Shortly
after the correction was published, the article was heavily
revised and Christodoulou's name replaced with the name
Eileen Weybridge," writes
Shootthemessenger.
"I love
journalism. It's so accurate and professional. War,
peace and the fate of millions ride on it. We're all in
such good hands."
Wow...! He
tweeted implying it's not journalists who are starting wars,
displacing millions, and leaving a trail of dead in their wake.
It's
governments, powerful ones who are willing to go to war over
lies about who's gassing whom.
Wikileaks, not
Assange, then retweeted a tweet which shows former president
Barack H. Obama, endorsing French presidential candidate
Emmanuel Macron.
The tweet is
probably meant to reflect Obama's condemnation of the alleged
Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election by showing
the former president openly meddling in France's election.
"Obama
intervenes in election to tell French to vote for Macron
after previously ordering CIA to steal parties' plans," the
tweet reads.
Linked to the
tweet was the following story.
In 2012, under
the Obama administration, the CIA was ordered, according to
Wikileaks to use all of its available human and electronic
assets to retrieve several political parties' plans for the
election.
Wikileaks
published the story taken from the leaked
CIA Vault 7 documents.
They wrote,
"All major
French political parties were targeted for infiltration by
the CIA's human ("HUMINT") and electronic ("SIGINT") spies
in the seven months leading up to France's 2012 presidential
election.
The
revelations are contained within three CIA tasking orders
published today by WikiLeaks as context for its forth coming
CIA Vault 7 series.
Named
specifically as targets are,
-
the
French Socialist Party (PS)
-
the
National Front (FN) and Union for a Popular Movement
(UMP) together with current President Francois
Hollande, then President Nicolas Sarkozy
-
current round one presidential front runner Marine
Le Pen
-
former presidential candidates Martine Aubry and
Dominique Strauss-Khan."
In his next
tweet, he openly defied the mainstream media's narrative.
He wrote,
"I
haven't been charged, have already been cleared and the
UN says I am right. Yes, CNN, I am dismissive."
Assange
is right.
He
hasn't been charged with any crimes and he attached
another subsequent tweet with a statement from the United
Nations (UN)
panel exonerating him from all allegations and legal
proceedings.
His
follow-up tweet was an upload of a court document which
asked for the Swedish Government to drop his arrest
warrant over the rape case SMS text messages now show
was a set-up.
The Washington Times
wrote that the court motion was a request for the
Swedish government to,
"drop a long-standing arrest warrant against their
client Wednesday so the WikiLeaks publisher may once
and for all take refuge in Ecuador in light of a
looming U.S. indictment."
As long
as there's an arrest warrant, Assange cannot seek
permanent political asylum in Ecuador.
Addressing his rape charges, Assange tweeted Thursday,
"The government of Sweden continues to be in breach
of the UN's findings in Assange vs. Sweden."
He
attached a video clip of Christophe Peschoux,
spokesperson for the UN's expert panel investigating
Assange.
In it,
Peschoux called for the UK and Sweden to restore to
Assange his liberty and compensate him for the
unwarranted charges of rape against the world's most
famous journalist.
Assange
then called out Hollywood's collusion with the American
government to create an anti-Assange film called "The
Fifth Estate."
He
linked his tweet to an interview of his friends who had
watched the film and were leaving the theater in shock
from the caricature that Assange is some paranoid cult
member.
A
person leaving the film called it "shit" and his friends
all agreed, saying it was anything but realistic.
The
witch-hunt continues against Assange.
As long
as he's alive and relaying to the world how various
intelligence agencies are spying on everyone using their
own cell phones, smart televisions, and computers, and
as long as he's publishing internal documents from
political parties who actively subvert their own
candidates, and as long as he publishes military secrets
the warmongers want to remain hidden, he'll always be a
marked man.
It
doesn't matter if he gets the political refuge he's
seeking; they're out to kill him, all for being a
journalist.
