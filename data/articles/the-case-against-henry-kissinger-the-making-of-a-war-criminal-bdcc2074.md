THE 1968 ELECTION - INDOCHINA
- CHILE
It will become clear, and may as well be stated at the outset, that this is
written by a political opponent of
Henry Kissinger.
Nonetheless, I have found myself continually
amazed at how much hostile and discreditable material I have felt compelled
to omit. I am concerned only with those Kissingerian offenses that might or
should form the basis of a legal prosecution: for war crimes, for crimes
against humanity, and for offenses against common or customary or
international law, including conspiracy to commit murder, kidnap, and
torture.
Thus, I might have mentioned Kissinger's recruitment and betrayal of the
Iraqi Kurds, who were falsely encouraged by him to take up arms against
Saddam Hussein in 1972-75, and who were then abandoned to extermination on
their hillsides when Saddam Hussein made a diplomatic deal with the Shah of
Iran, and who were deliberately lied to as well as abandoned.
The conclusions of the report by Congressman
Otis Pike still make shocking reading and reveal on Kissinger's part a
callous indifference to human life and human rights.
But they fall into the category of depraved
realpolitik and do not seem to have violated any known law.
In the same way, Kissinger's orchestration of political and military and
diplomatic cover for apartheid in South Africa presents us with a morally
repulsive record and includes the appalling consequences of the
destabilization of Angola. Again, though, one is looking at a sordid period
of Cold War and imperial history, and an exercise of irresponsible power,
rather than an episode of organized crime.
Additionally, one must take into account the
institutional nature of this policy, which might in outline have been
followed under any administration, national security adviser, or secretary
of state.
Similar reservations can be held about Kissinger's chairmanship of the
Presidential Commission on Central America in the early 1980s, which was
staffed by Oliver North and which whitewashed death-squad activity on the
isthmus. Or about the political protection provided by Kissinger, while in
office, for the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran and its machinery of torture and
repression. The list, it is sobering to say, could be protracted very much
further.
But it will not do to blame the whole exorbitant
cruelty and cynicism of decades on one man. (Occasionally one gets an
intriguing glimpse, as when Kissinger urges President Ford not to receive
the inconvenient Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, all the while posing as Communism's
most daring and principled foe.)
No, I have confined myself to the identifiable crimes that can and should be
placed on a proper bill of indictment, whether the actions taken were in
line with general "policy" or not.
These include, in this installment, the
deliberate mass killing of civilian populations in Indochina and the
personal suborning and planning of murder of a senior constitutional officer
in a democratic nation - Chile - with which the United States was not at
war. In a second installment we will see that this criminal habit of mind
extends to Bangladesh, Cyprus, East Timor, and even to Washington, D.C.
Some of these allegations can be constructed only prima facie, since Mr.
Kissinger - in what may also amount to a deliberate and premeditated
obstruction of justice - has caused large tranches of evidence to be
withheld or possibly destroyed. We now, however, enter upon the age when the
defense of "sovereign immunity" for state crimes has been held to be void.
As I demonstrate below, Kissinger has understood
this decisive change even if many of his critics have not.
The House of Lords' ruling in London, on the
international relevance of General Augusto Pinochet's crimes, added to the
splendid activism of the Spanish magistracy and the verdicts of the
International Tribunal at The Hague, has destroyed the shield that immunized
crimes committed under the justification of raison d'etat.
There is now no reason why a warrant for the
trial of Kissinger may not be issued in any one of a number of jurisdictions
and no reason why he may not be compelled to answer it. Indeed, as I write,
there are a number of jurisdictions where the law is at long last beginning
to catch up with the evidence. And we have before us in any case the
Nuremberg precedent, by which the United States solemnly undertook to be
bound.
A failure to proceed will constitute a double or triple offense to justice.
First, it will violate the essential and now uncontested principle that not
even the most powerful are above the law. Second, it will suggest that
prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity are reserved for
losers, or for minor despots in relatively negligible countries.
This in turn will lead to the paltry
politicization of what could have been a noble process and to the
justifiable suspicion of double standards.
Many if not most of Kissinger's partners in politics, from Greece to Chile
to Argentina to Indonesia, are now in jail or awaiting trial. His own lonely
impunity is rank; it smells to heaven. If it is allowed to persist then we
shall shamefully vindicate the ancient philosopher
Anacharsis, who
maintained that laws were like cobwebs - strong enough to detain only the
weak and too weak to hold the strong.
In the name of innumerable victims known and
unknown, it is time for justice to take a hand.
REGARDING HENRY
On December 2, 1998, Michael Korda was being interviewed on camera in
his office at Simon & Schuster.
As one of the reigning magnates of New York
publishing, he had edited and "produced" the work of authors as various as,
-
Tennessee Williams
-
Richard Nixon
-
Joan Crawford
-
Joe Bonanno
On this particular day, he was talking about the
life and thoughts of Cher, whose portrait adorned the wall behind him. And
then the telephone rang and there was a message to call "Dr." Henry
Kissinger as soon as possible.
A polymath like Korda knows - what with the
exigencies of publishing in these vertiginous days - how to switch in an
instant between Cher and high statecraft. The camera kept running, and
recorded the following scene for a tape that I possess:
Asking his secretary to get the number (759-7919 - the digits of Kissinger
Associates), Korda quips dryly, to general laughter in the office, that it,
"should be 1-800-CAMBODIA...
1-800-BOMB-CAMBODIA."
After a pause of nicely calibrated duration (no
senior editor likes to be put on hold while he's receiving company,
especially media company) it's,
"Henry - Hi, how are you?... You're getting
all the publicity you could want in the New York Times but not the kind
you want... I also think it's very, very dubious for the administration
to simply say yes, they'll release these papers... no... no,
absolutely... no... no... well, hmmm, yeah. We did it until quite
recently, frankly, and he did prevail...
Well, I don't think there's any question
about that, as uncomfortable as it may be... Henry, this is totally
outrageous... yeah... also the jurisdiction. This is a Spanish judge
appealing to an English court about a Chilean head of state. So it's,
it... Also, Spain has no rational jurisdiction over events in Chile
anyway, so that makes absolutely no sense... Well, that's probably
true... If you would.
I think that would be by far and away the
best... Right, yeah, no, I think it's exactly what you should do, and I
don't think it should be long, and I think it should end with your
father's letter. I think it's a very important document... Yes, but I
think the letter is wonderful, and central to the entire book.
Can you let me read the Lebanon chapter over
the weekend?"
At this point the conversation ends, with some
jocular observations by Korda about his upcoming colonoscopy: "a totally
repulsive procedure."
By means of the same tiny internal camera, or its forensic equivalent, one
could deduce not a little about the world of Henry Kissinger from this
microcosmic exchange.
The first and most important is this: Sitting in
his office at Kissinger Associates, with its tentacles of business and
consultancy stretching from Belgrade to Beijing, and cushioned by
innumerable other directorships and boards, he still shudders when he hears
of the arrest of a dictator. Syncopated the conversation with Korda may be,
but it's clear that the keyword is "jurisdiction."
What had the New York Times been reporting that
fine morning? On December 2, 1998, its front page carried the following
report from Tim Weiner, the paper's national-security correspondent in
Washington.
Under the headline "U.S. Will Release Files on
Crimes Under Pinochet," he wrote:
Treading into a political and diplomatic
confrontation it tried to avoid, the United States decided today to
declassify some secret documents on the killings and torture committed
during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile....
The decision to release such documents is the first sign that the United
States will cooperate in the case against General Pinochet. Clinton
Administration officials said they believed the benefits of openness in
human rights cases outweighed the risks to national security in this
case. But the decision could open "a can of worms," in the words of a
former Central Intelligence Agency official stationed in Chile, exposing
the depth of the knowledge that the United States had about crimes
charged against the Pinochet Government....
While some European government officials have supported bringing the
former dictator to court, United States officials have stayed largely
silent, reflecting skepticism about the Spanish court's power doubts
about international tribunals aimed at former foreign rulers, and
worries over the implications for American leaders who might someday
also be accused in foreign countries.
President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger, who served as his
national security advisor and Secretary of State, supported a right-wing
coup in Chile in the early 1970s, previously declassified documents
show.
But many of the actions of the United States during the 1973 coup, and
much of what American leaders and intelligence services did in liaison
with the Pinochet Government after it seized power, remain under the
seal of national security. The secret files on the Pinochet regime are
held by the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency the State
Department, the Pentagon, the National Security Council, the National
Archives, the Presidential libraries of Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter,
and other Government agencies.
According to Justice Department records,
these files contain a history of human rights abuses and international
terrorism:
-
In 1975 State Department diplomats in
Chile protested the Pinochet regime's record of killing and torture,
filing dissents to American foreign policy with their superiors in
Washington.
-
The C.I.A. has files on assassinations
by the regime and the Chilean secret police. The intelligence agency
also has records on Chile's attempts to establish an international
right-wing covert-action squad.
-
The Ford Library contains many of Mr.
Kissinger's secret files on Chile, which have never been made
public. Through a secretary, Mr. Kissinger declined a request for an
interview today.
One must credit Kissinger with grasping what so
many other people did not: that if the Pinochet precedent became
established, then he himself was in some danger.
The United States believes that it alone pursues
and indicts war criminals and "international terrorists"; nothing in its
political or journalistic culture yet allows for the thought that it might
be harboring and sheltering such a senior one.
Yet the thought had very obliquely surfaced in
Weiner's story, and Kissinger was a worried man when he called his editor
that day to discuss the concluding volume of his memoirs (eventually
published under the unbearably dull and self-regarding title Years of
Renewal), which was still in progress.
"Harboring and sheltering," though, are understatements for the lavishness
of Henry Kissinger's circumstances. His advice is sought, at $30,000 an
appearance, by audiences of businessmen and academics and policymakers. His
turgid newspaper column is syndicated by the Los Angeles Times and appears
as far afield as the Washington Post.
His first volume of memoirs was in part written,
and also edited, by Harold Evans, who with Tina Brown is among the many
hosts and hostesses who solicit Kissinger's company, or perhaps one should
say society, for their New York soirees. At different times, he has been a
consultant to ABC News and CBS; his most successful diplomacy, indeed, has
probably been conducted with the media (and his single greatest achievement
has been to get almost everybody to call him "Doctor").
Fawned on by Ted Koppel, sought out by
corporations and despots with "image" problems or "failures of
communication," and given respectful attention by presidential candidates
and those whose task it is to "mold" their global vision, this man wants for
little in the pathetic universe that the "self-esteem" industry exists to
serve.
Of whom else would Norman Podhoretz
write, in a bended-knee encomium to the second volume of Kissinger's
memoirs, Years of Upheaval:
What we have here is writing of the very
highest order. It is writing that is equally at ease in portraiture and
abstract analysis; that can shape a narrative as skillfully as it can
paint a scene; that can achieve marvels of compression while moving at
an expansive and leisurely pace.
It is writing that can shift without strain
or falsity of tone from the gravitas befitting a book about great
historical events to the humor and irony dictated by an unfailing sense
of human proportion.
A critic who can suck like that, as was once
dryly said by one of my moral tutors, need never dine alone. Nor need his
subject.
Except that, every now and then, the recipient
(and donor) of so much sycophancy feels a tremor of anxiety. He leaves the
well-furnished table and scurries to the bathroom.
Is it perhaps another disclosure on a newly
released Nixon tape? Some stray news from Indonesia portending the fall or
imprisonment of another patron (and perhaps the escape of an awkward
document or two)? The arrest or indictment of a torturer or assassin; the
expiry of the statute of secrecy for some obscure cabinet papers in a
faraway country?
Any one of these can instantly spoil his day. As
we see from the Korda tape, Kissinger cannot open the morning paper with the
assurance of tranquility. Because he knows what others can only suspect, or
guess at. And he is a prisoner of the knowledge, as, to some extent, are we.
Notice the likable way in which Michael Korda demonstrates his
broad-mindedness with the Cambodia jest. Everybody "knows," after all, that
Kissinger inflicted terror and misery and mass death on that country, and
great injury to the United States Constitution at the same time. (Everybody
also "knows" that other vulnerable nations can lay claim to the same
melancholy and hateful distinction as Cambodia, with incremental or
"collateral" damage to American democracy keeping pace.)
Yet the pudgy man standing in black tie at the
Vogue party is not, surely, the man who ordered and sanctioned the
destruction of civilian populations, the assassination of inconvenient
politicians, the kidnapping and disappearance of soldiers and journalists
and clerics who got in his way. Oh, but he is. He's exactly the same man.
And that may be among the most nauseating
reflections of all. Kissinger is not invited and feted because of his
exquisite manners or his mordant wit (his manners are in any case rather
gross, and his wit consists of a quiver of borrowed and secondhand darts).
No, he is sought after because his presence supplies a frisson, the
authentic touch of raw and unapologetic power.
There's a slight guilty nervousness on the edge
of Korda's gag about the indescribable sufferings of Indochina.
And I've noticed, time and again, standing at
the back of the audience during Kissinger speeches, that laughter of the
nervous, uneasy kind is the sort of laughter he likes to provoke.
In exacting this tribute, he flaunts not the
"aphrodisiac" of power (another of his plagiarized bons mots) but its
pornography.
DRESS REHEARSAL - THE
SECRET OF '68
There exists, within the political class of Washington, D.C., an open secret
that is too momentous and too awful to tell.
Although it is well known to academic
historians, senior reporters, former Cabinet members, and ex-diplomats, it
has never been summarized all at one time in any one place. The reason for
this is, on first viewing, paradoxical. The open secret is in the possession
of both major political parties, and it directly implicates the past
statecraft of at least three former presidencies.
Thus, its full disclosure would be in the
interest of no particular faction. Its truth is therefore the guarantee of
its obscurity; it lies like Poe's "purloined letter" across the very aisle
that signifies bipartisanship.
Here is the secret in plain words. In the fall of 1968, Richard Nixon and
some of his emissaries and underlings set out to sabotage the Paris peace
negotiations on Vietnam. The means they chose were simple: they privately
assured the South Vietnamese military rulers that an incoming Republican
regime would offer them a better deal than would a Democratic one. In this
way, they undercut both the talks themselves and the electoral strategy of
Vice President Hubert Humphrey.
The tactic "worked," in that the South
Vietnamese junta withdrew from the talks on the eve of the election, thereby
destroying the peace initiative on which the Democrats had based their
campaign. In another way, it did not "work," because four years later the
Nixon Administration tried to conclude the war on the same terms that had
been on offer in Paris.
The reason for the dead silence that still
surrounds the question is that in those intervening years some 20,000
Americans and an uncalculated number of Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians
lost their lives. Lost them, that is to say, even more pointlessly than had
those slain up to that point. The impact of those four years on Indochinese
society, and on American democracy, is beyond computation.
The chief beneficiary of the covert action, and
of the subsequent slaughter, was Henry Kissinger.
I can already hear the guardians of consensus, scraping their blunted quills
to dismiss this as a "conspiracy theory." I happily accept the challenge.
Let us take, first, the Diaries of that renowned conspirator (and theorist
of conspiracy) H.R. Haldeman, published in May 1994.
I choose to start with them for two reasons.
First, because on the logical inference of
"evidence against interest" it is improbable that Mr. Haldeman would supply
evidence of his knowledge of a crime, unless he was (posthumously) telling
the truth. Second, because it is possible to trace back each of his entries
to its origin in other documented sources.
In January 1973, the Nixon-Kissinger Administration - for which Haldeman
took the minutes - was heavily engaged on two fronts. In Paris again, Henry
Kissinger was striving to negotiate "peace with honor" in Vietnam.
In Washington, D.C., the web of evidence against
the Watergate burglars and buggers was beginning to tighten.
On January 8, 1973, Haldeman records:
John Dean called to report on the Watergate
trials, says that if we can prove in any way by hard evidence that our
[campaign] plane was bugged in '68, he thinks that we could use that as
a basis to say we're going to force Congress to go back and investigate
'68 as well as '72, and thus turn them off.
Three days later, on January 11, 1973, Haldeman
hears from Nixon ("the P," as the Diaries call him):
On the Watergate question, he wanted me to
talk to [Attorney General John] Mitchell and have him find out from [Deke]
De Loach [of the FBI] if the guy who did the bugging on us in 1968 is
still at the FBI, and then [FBI acting director Patrick] Gray should
nail him with a lie detector and get it settled, which would give us the
evidence we need.
He also thinks I ought to move with George
Christian [President Johnson's former press secretary, then working with
Democrats for Nixon], get LBJ to use his influence to turn off the Hill
investigation with Califano, Hubert, and so on. Later in the day, he
decided that wasn't such a good idea, and told me not to do it, which I
fortunately hadn't done.
On the same day, Haldeman reports Henry
Kissinger calling excitedly from Paris, saying,
"he'll do the signing in Paris rather than
Hanoi, which is the key thing."
He speaks also of getting South Vietnam's
President Thieu to "go along."
On the following day:
The P also got back on the Watergate thing
today, making the point that I should talk to Connally about the Johnson
bugging process to get his judgment as to how to handle it. He wonders
if we shouldn't just have Andreas go in and scare Hubert. The problem in
going at LBJ is how he'd react, and we need to find out from [Deke] De
Loach who did it, and then run a lie detector on him.
I talked to Mitchell on the phone on this
subject and he said De Loach had told him he was up to date on the thing
because he had a call from Texas.
A Star re' porter was making an inquiry in
the last week or so, and LBJ got very hot and called Deke and said to
him that if the Nixon people are going to play with this, that he would
release [deleted material-national security], saying that our side was
asking that certain things be done. By our side, I assume he means the
Nixon campaign organization.
De Loach took this as a direct threat from
Johnson... As he recalls it, bugging was requested on the planes, but
was turned down, and all they did was check the phone calls, and put a
tap on the Dragon Lady [Mrs. Anna Chennault].
This bureaucratic prose may be hard to read, but
it needs no cipher to decode itself.
Under intense pressure about the bugging of the
Watergate building, Nixon instructed his chief of staff, Haldeman, and his
FBI contact, Deke DeLoach, to unmask the bugging to which his own
campaign had been subjected in 1968. He also sounded out former president
Johnson, through former senior Democrats like Texas governor John
Connally, to gauge what his reaction to the disclosure might be.
The aim was to show that "everybody does it."
(By another bipartisan paradox, in Washington the slogan "they all do it" is
used as a slogan for the defense rather than, as one might hope, for the
prosecution.)
However, a problem presents itself at once: how to reveal the 1968 bugging
without at the same time revealing what that bugging had been about. Hence
the second thoughts ("wasn't such a good idea ...").
In his excellent introduction to The Haldeman
Diaries, Nixon's biographer Professor Stephen Ambrose characterizes
the 1973 approach to Lyndon Johnson as "prospective blackmail," designed to
exert backstairs pressure to close down a congressional inquiry. But he also
suggests that Johnson, himself no pushover, had some blackmail ammunition of
his own.
As Professor Ambrose phrases it, the Diaries had
been vetted by the National Security Council, and the bracketed deletion
cited above is,
"the only place in the book where an example
is given of a deletion by the NSC during the Carter Administration."
"Eight days later Nixon was inaugurated for
his second term," Ambrose relays.
"Ten days later Johnson died of a heart
attack. What Johnson had on Nixon I suppose we'll never know."
The professor's conclusion here is arguably too
tentative.
There is a well-understood principle known as
"Mutual Assured Destruction," whereby both sides possess more than enough
material with which to annihilate the other. The answer to the question of
what the Johnson Administration "had" on Nixon is a relatively easy one. It
was given in a book entitled Counsel to the President, published in 1991.
Its author was Clark Clifford, the
quintessential blue-chip Washington insider, who was assisted in the writing
by Richard Holbrooke, the former assistant secretary of state and current
ambassador to the United Nations. In 1968, Clark Clifford was secretary of
defense and Richard Holbrooke was a member of the American negotiating team
at the Vietnam peace talks in Paris.
From his seat in the Pentagon, Clifford had been able to read the
intelligence transcripts that picked up and recorded what he terms a "secret
personal channel" between President Thieu in Saigon and the Nixon campaign.
The chief interlocutor at the American end was John Mitchell, then Nixon's
campaign manager and subsequently attorney general (and subsequently
Prisoner Number 24171-157 in the Maxwell Air Force Base prison camp).
He was actively assisted by Madame Anna
Chennault, known to all as the "Dragon Lady." A fierce veteran of the
Taiwan lobby, and all-purpose right-wing intriguer, she was a social and
political force in the Washington of her day and would rate her own
biography.
Clifford describes a private meeting at which he, President Johnson,
Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and National Security Adviser Walt
Rostow were present. Hawkish to a man, they kept Vice President Humphrey
out of the loop. But, hawkish as they were, they were appalled at the
evidence of Nixon's treachery.
They nonetheless decided not to go public with
what they knew.
Clifford says that this was because the
disclosure would have ruined the Paris talks altogether. He could have added
that it would have created a crisis of confidence in American institutions.
There are some things that the voters can't be trusted to know. And even
though the bugging had been legal, it might not have looked like fair play.
(The Logan Act flatly prohibits any American from conducting private
diplomacy with a foreign power.)
In the event, Thieu pulled out of the negotiations anyway, ruining them just
three days before the election.
Clifford is in no doubt of the advice on which
he did so:
The activities of the Nixon team went far
beyond the bounds of justifiable political combat. It constituted direct
interference in the activities of the executive branch and the
responsibilities of the Chief Executive, the only people with authority
to negotiate on behalf of the nation.
The activities of the Nixon campaign
constituted a gross, even potentially illegal, interference in the
security affairs of the nation by private individuals.
Perhaps aware of the slight feebleness of his
lawyerly prose, and perhaps a little ashamed of keeping the secret for his
memoirs rather than sharing it with the electorate, Clifford adds in a
footnote:
It should be remembered that the public was
considerably more innocent in such matters in the days before the
Watergate hearings and the 1975 Senate investigation of the CIA.
Perhaps the public was indeed more innocent, if
only because of the insider reticence of white-shoe lawyers like Clifford,
who thought there were some things too profane to be made known.
He claims now that he was in favor either of
confronting Nixon privately with the information and forcing him to desist,
or else of making it public. Perhaps this was indeed his view.
A more wised-up age of investigative reporting has brought us several
updates on this appalling episode. And so has the very guarded memoir of
Richard Nixon himself. More than one "back channel" was required for the
Republican destabilization of the Paris peace talks. There had to be secret
communications between Nixon and the South Vietnamese, as we have seen.
But there also had to be an informant inside the
incumbent administration's camp, a source of hints and tips and early
warnings of official intentions. That informant was Henry Kissinger. In his
own account, RN - The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, the disgraced elder
statesman tells us that, in mid-September 1968, he received private word of
a planned bombing halt. In other words, the Johnson Administration would,
for the sake of the negotiations, consider suspending its aerial bombardment
of North Vietnam.
This most useful advance intelligence, Nixon
tells us, came "through a highly unusual channel."
It was more unusual even than he acknowledged.
Kissinger had until then been a devoted partisan of Nelson Rockefeller, the
matchlessly wealthy prince of liberal Republicanism. His contempt for the
person and the policies of Richard Nixon was undisguised. Indeed, President
Johnson's Paris negotiators, led by Averell Harriman, considered
Kissinger to be almost one of themselves.
He had made himself helpful, as Rockefeller's
chief foreign-policy adviser, by supplying French intermediaries with their
own contacts in Hanoi.
"Henry was the only person outside of the
government we were authorized to discuss the negotiations with," Richard
Holbrooke told Walter Isaacson.
"We trusted him. It is not stretching the
truth to say that the Nixon campaign had a secret source within the U.S.
negotiating team."
So the likelihood of a bombing halt, wrote
Nixon,
"came as no real surprise to me."
He added:
"I told Haldeman that Mitchell should
continue as liaison with Kissinger and that we should honor his desire
to keep his role completely confidential."
It is impossible that Nixon was unaware of his
campaign manager's parallel role in colluding with a foreign power.
Thus began what was effectively a domestic
covert operation, directed simultaneously at thwarting the talks and
embarrassing the Hubert Humphrey campaign.
Later in the month, on September 26 to be precise, and as recorded by Nixon
in his memoirs,
"Kissinger called again. He said that he had
just returned from Paris, where he had picked up word that something big
was afoot regarding Vietnam. He advised that if I had anything to say
about Vietnam during the following week, I should avoid any new ideas or
proposals."
On the same day, Nixon declined a challenge from
Humphrey for a direct debate.
On October 12, Kissinger once again made
contact, suggesting that a bombing halt might be announced as soon as
October 23. And so it might have been. Except that for some reason, every
time the North Vietnamese side came closer to agreement, the South
Vietnamese increased their own demands. We now know why and how that was,
and how the two halves of the strategy were knit together.
As far back as July, Nixon had met quietly in
New York with the South Vietnamese ambassador, Bui Diem. The contact had
been arranged by Anna Chennault. Bugging of the South Vietnamese offices in
Washington, and surveillance of the "Dragon Lady," showed how the ratchet
operated.
An intercepted cable from Diem to President
Thieu on the fateful day of October 23 had him saying:
"Many Republican friends have contacted me
and encouraged us to stand firm. They were alarmed by press reports to
the effect that you had already softened your position."
The wiretapping instructions went to one Cartha
DeLoach, known as "Deke" to his associates, who was J. Edgar Hoover's FBI
liaison officer to the White House.
We met him, you may recall, in H.R. Haldeman's
Diaries.
In 1999 the author Anthony Summers was finally able to gain access to the
closed FBI file of intercepts of the Nixon campaign, which he published in
his 2000 book, The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon. He
was also able to interview Anna Chennault. These two breakthroughs furnished
him with what is vulgarly termed a "smoking gun" on the 1968 conspiracy.
By the end of October 1968, John Mitchell had
become so nervous about official surveillance that he ceased taking calls
from Chennault. And President Johnson, in a conference call to the three
candidates, Nixon, Humphrey, and Wallace (allegedly to brief them on the
bombing halt), had strongly implied that he knew about the covert efforts to
stymie his Vietnam diplomacy.
This call created near-panic in Nixon's inner
circle and caused Mitchell to telephone Chennault at the Sheraton Park
Hotel. He then asked her to call him back on a more secure line.
"Anna," he told her,
"I'm speaking on behalf of Mr. Nixon. It's
very important that our Vietnamese friends understand our Republican
position, and I hope you made that clear to them... Do you think they
really have decided not to go to Paris?"
The reproduced FBI original document shows what
happened next.
On November 2, 1968, the agent reported:
MRS. ANNA CHENNAULT CONTACTED VIETNAMESE
AMBASSADOR, BUI DIEM, AND ADVISED HIM THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A MESSAGE
FROM HER BOSS (NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED), WHICH HER BOSS WANTED HER TO
GIVE PERSONALLY TO THE AMBASSADOR.
SHE SAID THAT THE MESSAGE WAS THAT THE
AMBASSADOR IS TO "HOLD ON, WE ARE GONNA WIN" AND THAT HER BOSS ALSO SAID
"HOLD ON, HE UNDERSTANDS ALL OF IT."
SHE REPEATED THAT THIS IS THE ONLY MESSAGE.
"HE SAID PLEASE TELL YOUR BOSS TO HOLD ON." SHE ADVISED THAT HER BOSS
HAD JUST CALLED FROM NEW MEXICO.
Nixon's running mate, Spiro Agnew, had been
campaigning in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that day, and subsequent
intelligence analysis revealed that he and another member of his staff (the
one principally concerned with Vietnam) had indeed been in touch with the
Chennault camp.
The beauty of having Kissinger leaking from one side and Anna Chennault and
John Mitchell conducting a private foreign policy on the other was this: It
enabled Nixon to avoid being drawn into the argument over a bombing halt.
And it further enabled him to suggest that it was the Democrats who were
playing politics with the issue.
On October 25, in New York, he used his
tried-and-tested tactic of circulating an innuendo while purporting to
disown it. Of LBJ's Paris diplomacy he said, "I am also told that this spurt
of activity is a cynical, last-minute attempt by President Johnson to
salvage the candidacy of Mr. Humphrey. This I do not believe."
Kissinger himself showed a similar ability to play both ends against the
middle. In the late summer of 1968, on Martha's Vineyard, he had offered
Nelson Rockefeller's files on Nixon to Professor Samuel Huntington, a close
adviser to Hubert Humphrey.
But when Huntington's colleague and friend
Zbigniew Brzezinski tried to get him to make good on the
offer, Kissinger became shy.
"I've hated Nixon for years," he told
Brzezinski, but the time wasn't quite ripe for the handover.
Indeed, it was a very close-run election,
turning in the end on the difference of a few hundred thousand votes, and
many hardened observers believe that the final difference was made when
Johnson ordered a bombing halt on October 31 and the South Vietnamese made
him look like a fool by boycotting the peace talks two days later.
Had things gone the other way, of course,
Kissinger was a near-certainty for a senior job in a Humphrey
administration.
With slight differences of emphasis, the larger pieces of this story appear
in Haldeman's work as cited and in Clifford's memoir. They are also
partially rehearsed in President Johnson's autobiography, The Vantage Point,
and in a long reflection on Indochina by William Bundy (one of the
architects of the war) entitled rather tritely The Tangled Web.
Senior members of the press corps, among them
Jules Witcover in his history of 1968, Seymour Hersh in his study of
Kissinger, and Walter Isaacson, editor of Time magazine, in his admiring but
critical biography, have produced almost congruent accounts of the same
abysmal episode.
The only mention of it that is completely and
utterly false, by any literary or historical standard, appears in the
memoirs of Henry Kissinger himself.
He writes just this:
Several Nixon emissaries - some
self-appointed - telephoned me for counsel. I took the position that I
would answer specific questions on foreign policy, but that I would not
offer general advice or volunteer suggestions. This was the same
response I made to inquiries from the Humphrey staff.
This contradicts even the self-serving memoir of
the man who, having won the 1968 election by these underhanded means, made
as his very first appointment Henry Kissinger as national security adviser.
One might not want to arbitrate a mendacity
competition between the two men, but when he made this choice Richard Nixon
had only once, briefly and awkwardly, met Henry Kissinger in person.
He clearly formed his estimate of the man's
abilities from more persuasive experience than that.
"One factor that had most convinced me of
Kissinger's credibility," wrote Nixon later in his own delicious prose,
"was the length to which he went to protect his secrecy."
That ghastly secret is now out.
In the January 1969 issue of the Establishment
house organ Foreign Affairs, published a few days after his appointment as
Nixon's right-hand man, there appeared Henry Kissinger's own evaluation of
the Vietnam negotiations. On every point of substance, he agreed with the
line taken in Paris by the Johnson-Humphrey negotiators. One has to pause
for an instant to comprehend the enormity of this.
Kissinger had helped elect a man who had
surreptitiously promised the South Vietnamese junta a better deal than they
would get from the Democrats. The Saigon authorities then acted, as Bundy
ruefully confirms, as if they did indeed have a deal. This meant, in the
words of a later Nixon slogan, "Four More Years."
But four more years of an unwinnable and
undeclared and murderous war, which was to spread before it burned out, and
was to end on the same terms and conditions as had been on the table in the
fall of 1968.
This was what it took to promote Henry Kissinger. To promote him from a
mediocre and opportunistic academic to an international potentate. The
signature qualities were there from the inaugural moment: the sycophancy and
the duplicity; the power worship and the absence of scruple; the empty
trading of old non-friends for new non-friends.
And the distinctive effects were also present:
the uncounted and expendable corpses; the official and unofficial lying
about the cost; the heavy and pompous pseudo-indignation when unwelcome
questions were asked. Kissinger's global career started as it meant to go
on.
It debauched the American republic and American
democracy, and it levied a hideous toll of casualties on weaker and more
vulnerable societies.
THE CRIME OF WAR, AND
BOMBING FOR VOTES
Even while compelled to concentrate on brute realities, one must never lose
sight of that element of the surreal that surrounds Henry Kissinger.
Paying a visit to Vietnam in the middle 1960s,
when many technocratic opportunists were still convinced that the war was
worth fighting and could be won, the young Henry reserved judgment on the
first point but developed considerable private doubts on the second. He had
gone so far as to involve himself with an initiative that extended to direct
personal contact with Hanoi.
He became friendly with two Frenchmen who had a
direct line to the Communist leadership in North Vietnam's capital.
Raymond Aubrac, a French civil servant who was a friend of Ho Chi Minh,
and Herbert Marcovich, a French microbiologist, began a series of trips to
North Vietnam. On their return, they briefed Kissinger in Paris.
He in his turn parlayed their information into
high-level conversations in Washington, relaying the actual or potential
negotiating positions of Pham Van Dong and other Communist statesmen to
Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. (In the result, the relentless bombing of
the North made any "bridge-building" impracticable. In particular, the now
forgotten American destruction of the Paul Doumer Bridge outraged the
Vietnamese side.)
This weightless mid-position, which ultimately helped enable his double act
in 1968, allowed Kissinger to ventriloquize Governor Rockefeller and to
propose, by indirect means, a future detente with America's chief rivals.
In his first major address as a candidate for
the Republican nomination in 1968, Rockefeller spoke ringingly of how,
"in a subtle triangle with Communist China
and the Soviet Union, we can ultimately improve our relations with each
- as we test the will for peace of both."
This foreshadowing of a later Kissinger strategy
might appear at first reading to illustrate prescience.
But Governor Rockefeller had no more reason than
Vice President Humphrey to suppose that his ambitious staffer would defect
to the Nixon camp, risking and postponing this same detente in order later
to take credit for a debased simulacrum of it.
Morally speaking, Kissinger treated the concept of superpower rapprochement
in the same way as he treated the concept of a negotiated settlement in
Vietnam: as something contingent on his own needs. There was a time to feign
support of it and a time to denounce it as weak-minded and treacherous. And
there was a time to take credit for it.
Some of those who "followed orders" in Indochina
may lay a claim to that notoriously weak defense. Some who even issued the
orders may now tell us that they were acting sincerely at the time.
But Kissinger cannot avail himself of this
alibi. He always knew what he was doing, and he embarked upon a second round
of protracted warfare having knowingly helped to destroy an alternative that
he always understood was possible. This increases the gravity of the charge
against him. It also prepares us for his improvised and retrospective
defense against that charge: that his immense depredations eventually led to
"peace."
When he announced that "peace is at hand" in
October 1972, he made a boastful and false claim that could have been made
in 1968.
And when he claimed credit for subsequent
superpower contacts, he was announcing the result of a secret and corrupt
diplomacy that had originally been proposed as an open and democratic one.
In the meantime, he had illegally eavesdropped
and shadowed American citizens and public servants whose misgivings about
the war, and about unconstitutional authority, were mild compared with those
of Messieurs Aubrac and Marcovich. In establishing what lawyers call the
mens rea, we can say that in Kissinger's case he was fully aware of, and
is entirely accountable for, his own actions.
Upon taking office at Richard Nixon's side in the winter of 1969, it was
Kissinger's task to be plus royaliste que le roi in two respects.
He had to confect a rationale of "credibility"
for punitive action in an already devastated Vietnamese theater, and he had
to second his principal's wish that he form part of a "wall" between the
Nixon White House and the Department of State.
The term "two track" was later to become
commonplace. Kissinger's position on both tracks, of promiscuous violence
abroad and flagrant illegality at home, was decided from the start. He does
not seem to have lacked relish for either commitment; one hopes faintly that
this was not the first twinge of the "aphrodisiac."
President Johnson's "bombing halt" had not lasted long by any standard, even
if one remembers that its original conciliatory purpose had been sordidly
undercut.
Averell Harriman, who had been LBJ's
chief negotiator in Paris, later testified to Congress that the North
Vietnamese had withdrawn 90 percent of their forces from the northern two
provinces of South Vietnam, in October and November 1968, in accordance with
the agreement of which the "halt" might have formed a part. In the new
context, however, this withdrawal could be interpreted as a sign of
weakness, or even as a "light at the end of the tunnel."
The historical record of the Indochina war is voluminous, and the resulting
controversy no less so. This does not, however, prevent the following of a
consistent thread. Once the war had been unnaturally and undemocratically
prolonged, more exorbitant methods were required to fight it and more
fantastic excuses had to be fabricated to justify it.
Let us take four connected cases in which the
civilian population was deliberately exposed to indiscriminate lethal force,
in which the customary laws of war and neutrality were violated, and in
which conscious lies had to be told in order to conceal these facts and
others.
The first such case is an example of what Vietnam might have been spared had
not the 1968 Paris peace talks been sabotaged. In December 1968, during the
"transition" period between the Johnson and Nixon administrations, the
United States military command turned to what General Creighton Abrams
termed "total war" against the "infrastructure" of the Vietcong/National
Liberation Front insurgency.
The chief exhibit in this campaign was a
six-month clearance of the province of Kien Hoa. The code name for the sweep
was Operation "Speedy Express."
It might, in some realm of theory, be remotely conceivable that such tactics
could be justified under the international laws and charters governing the
sovereign rights of self-defense. But no nation capable of deploying the
overwhelming and annihilating force described below would be likely to find
itself on the defensive.
And it would be least of all likely to find
itself on the defensive on its own soil. So the Nixon-Kissinger
Administration was not, except in one unusual sense, fighting for survival.
The unusual sense in which its survival was at stake is set out, yet again,
in the stark posthumous testimony of H.R. Haldeman.
From his roost at Nixon's side he describes a
Kissingerian moment on December 15, 1970:
K[issinger] came in and the discussion
covered some of the general thinking about Vietnam and the P's big peace
plan for next year, which K later told me he does not favor.
He thinks that any pullout next year would
be a serious mistake because the adverse reaction to it could set in
well before the `72 elections. He favors, instead, a continued winding
down and then a pullout right at the fall of `72 so that if any bad
results follow they will be too late to affect the election.
One could hardly wish for it to be more plainly
put than that. (And put, furthermore, by one of Nixon's chief partisans with
no wish to discredit the re-election.)
But in point of fact, Kissinger himself admits
to almost as much in his own first volume of memoirs, The White House Years.
The context is a meeting with General de Gaulle, in which the old warrior
demanded to know by what right the Nixon Administration subjected Indochina
to devastating bombardment.
In his own account, Kissinger replies that "a
sudden withdrawal might give us a credibility problem." (When asked "where?"
Kissinger hazily proposed the Middle East.)
It is important to bear in mind that the future
flatterer of Brezhnev and Mao was in no real position to claim that he made
war in Indochina to thwart either. He certainly did not dare try such a
callow excuse on Charles de Gaulle. And indeed, the proponent of secret
deals with China was in no very strong position to claim that he was
combating Stalinism in general. No, it all came down to "credibility" and to
the saving of face.
It is known that 20,763 American, 109,230 South
Vietnamese, and 496,260 North Vietnamese servicemen lost their lives in
Indochina between the day that Nixon and Kissinger took office and the day
in 1973 that they withdrew American forces and accepted the logic of 1968.
Must the families of these victims confront the
fact that the chief "faces" at risk were those of Nixon and Kissinger?
Thus the colloquially titled "Christmas bombing" of North Vietnam, continued
after that election had been won, must be counted as a war crime by any
standard. The bombing was not conducted for anything that could be described
as "military reasons" but for twofold political ones.
The first of these was domestic:
a show of strength to extremists in Congress
and a means of putting the Democratic Party on the defensive.
The second was to persuade South Vietnamese
leaders such as President Thieu - whose intransigence had been encouraged by
Kissinger in the first place - that their objections to American withdrawal
were too nervous.
This, again, was the mortgage on the initial
secret payment of 1968.
When the unpreventable collapse occurred in Cambodia and Vietnam, in April
and May 1975, the cost was infinitely higher than it would have been seven
years previously. These locust years ended as they had begun - with a
display of bravado and deceit. On May 12, 1975, in the immediate aftermath
of the Khmer Rouge seizure of power, Cambodian gunboats detained an American
merchant vessel named the Mayaguez.
The ship was stopped in international waters
claimed by Cambodia and then taken to the Cambodian island of Koh Tang. In
spite of reports that the crew had been released, Kissinger pressed for an
immediate face-saving and "credibility"-enhancing strike. He persuaded
President Gerald Ford, the untried and undistinguished successor to his
deposed former boss, to send in the Marines and the Air Force.
Out of a Marine force of 110, 18 were killed and
50 were wounded. Twenty-three Air Force men died in a crash. The United
States used a 15,000-ton bomb on the island, the most powerful nonnuclear
device that it possessed. Nobody has the figures for Cambodian deaths.
The casualties were pointless, because the
ship's company of the Mayaguez were nowhere on Koh Tang, having been
released some hours earlier. A subsequent congressional inquiry found that
Kissinger could have known of this by listening to Cambodian broadcasting or
by paying attention to a third-party government that had been negotiating a
deal for the restitution of the crew and the ship.
It was not as if any Cambodians doubted, by that
month of 1975, the willingness of the U.S. government to employ deadly
force.
In Washington, D.C., there is a famous and hallowed memorial to the American
dead of the Vietnam War. Known as the "Vietnam Veterans Memorial," it bears
a name that is slightly misleading.
I was present for the extremely affecting moment
of its dedication in 1982 and noticed that the list of nearly 60,000 names
is incised in the wall not by alphabet but by date. The first few names
appear in 1959 and the last few in 1975.
The more historically minded visitors can
sometimes be heard to say that they didn't know the United States was
engaged in Vietnam as early or as late as that. Nor was the public supposed
to know. The first names are of the covert operatives, sent in by Colonel
Edward Lansdale without congressional approval to support French
colonialism. The last names are of those thrown away in the Mayaguez fiasco.
It took Henry Kissinger to ensure that a war of
atrocity, which he had helped to prolong, should end as furtively and
ignominiously as it had begun.
A SAMPLE OF CASES -
KISSINGER'S WAR CRIMES IN INDOCHINA
Some statements are too blunt for everyday, consensual discourse.
In national "debate," it is the smoother pebbles
that are customarily gathered from the stream and used as projectiles. They
leave less of a scar, even when they hit. Occasionally, however, a single
hard-edged remark will inflict a deep and jagged wound, a gash so ugly that
it must be cauterized at once. In January 1971 there was a considered
statement from General Telford Taylor, who had been chief U.S. prosecuting
counsel at the Nuremberg trials.
Reviewing the legal and moral basis of those
hearings, and also the Tokyo trials of Japanese war criminals and the Manila
trial of Emperor Hirohito's chief militarist, General Yamashita Tomoyuki,
Taylor said that if the standard of Nuremberg and Manila were applied
evenly, and applied to the American statesmen and bureaucrats who designed
the war in Vietnam, then,
"there would be a very strong possibility
that they would come to the same end [Yamashita] did."
It is not every day that a senior American
soldier and jurist delivers the opinion that a large portion of his
country's political class should probably be hooded and blindfolded and
dropped through a trapdoor on the end of a rope.
In his book Nuremberg and Vietnam, General Taylor also anticipated one of
the possible objections to this legal and moral conclusion. It might be
argued for the defense, he said, that those arraigned did not really know
what they were doing; in other words, that they had achieved the foulest
results but from the highest and most innocent motives.
The notion of Indochina as some Heart of
Darkness "quagmire" of ignorant armies has been sedulously propagated, then
and since, in order to make such a euphemism appear plausible.
Taylor had no patience with such a view.
American military and intelligence and economic and political teams had been
in Vietnam, he wrote, for much too long to attribute anything they did "to
lack of information."
It might have been possible for soldiers and
diplomats to pose as innocents until the middle of the 1960s, but after that
time, and especially after the My Lai massacre of March 16, 1968, when
serving veterans reported major atrocities to their superior officers,
nobody could reasonably claim to have been uninformed, and of those who
could, the least believable would be those who - far from the confusion of
battle - read and discussed and approved the panoptic reports of the war
that were delivered to Washington.
General Taylor's book was being written while many of the most reprehensible
events of the Indochina war were still taking place, or still to come.
He was unaware of the intensity and extent of,
for example, the bombing of Laos and Cambodia. Enough was known about the
conduct of the war, however, and about the existing matrix of legal and
criminal responsibility, for him to arrive at some indisputable conclusions.
The first of these concerned the particular
obligation of the United States to be aware of, and to respect, the
Nuremberg principles:
"Military courts and commissions have
customarily B rendered their judgments stark and unsupported by opinions
giving the reasons for their decisions. The Nuremberg and Tokyo
judgments, in contrast, were all based on extensive opinions detailing
the evidence and analyzing the factual and legal issues, in the fashion
of appellate tribunals generally.
Needless to say they were not of uniform
quality, and often reflected the logical shortcomings of compromise, the
marks of which commonly mar the opinions of multi-member tribunals.
But the process was professional in a way
seldom achieved in military courts, and the records and judgments in
these trials provided a much needed foundation for a corpus of
judge-made international penal law. The results of the trials commended
themselves to the newly formed United Nations, and on Dec. 11, 1946, the
General Assembly adopted a resolution affirming "the principles of
international law recognized by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal
and the judgment of the Tribunal."
However history may ultimately assess the wisdom or unwisdom of the war
crimes trials, one thing is in disputable: At their conclusion, the
United States Government stood legally, politically and morally
committed to the principles enunciated in the charters and judgments of
the tribunals.
The President of the United States, on the
recommendations of the Departments of State, War and Justice, approved
the war crimes programs. Thirty or more American judges, drawn from the
appellate benches of the states from Massachusetts to Oregon, and
Minnesota to Georgia, conducted the later Nuremberg trials and wrote the
opinions.
General Douglas MacArthur, under authority
of the Far Eastern Commission, established the Tokyo tribunal and
confirmed the sentences it imposed, and it was under his authority as
the highest American military officer in the Far East that the Yamashita
and other such proceedings were held.
The United States delegation to the United
Nations presented the resolution by which the General Assembly endorsed
the Nuremberg principles.
"Thus the integrity of the nation is staked on those principles, and
today the question is how they apply to our conduct of the war in
Vietnam, and whether the United States Government is prepared to face
the consequences of their application."
Facing and cogitating these consequences
himself, General Taylor took issue with another United States officer,
Colonel William Corson, who had written that,
"[r]egardless of the outcome of... the My
Lai courts-martial and other legal actions, the point remains that
American judgment as to the effective prosecution of the war was faulty
from beginning to end and that the atrocities, alleged or otherwise, are
a result of a failure of judgment, not criminal behavior."
To this Taylor responded:
Colonel Corson overlooks, I fear, that
negligent homicide is generally a crime of bad judgment rather than evil
intent. Perhaps he is right in the strictly causal sense that if there
had been no failure of judgment, the occasion for criminal conduct would
not have arisen.
The Germans in occupied Europe made gross
errors of judgment which no doubt created the conditions in which the
slaughter of the inhabitants of Klissura [a Greek village annihilated
during the Occupation] occurred, but that did not make the killings any
the less criminal.
Referring this question to the chain of command
in the field, General Taylor noted further that the senior officer corps had
been,
more or less constantly in Vietnam, and
splendidly equipped with helicopters and other aircraft, which gave them
a degree of mobility unprecedented in earlier wars, and consequently
endowed them with every opportunity to keep the course of the fighting
and its consequences under close and constant observation.
Communications were generally rapid and
efficient, so that the flow of information and orders was unimpeded.
These circumstances are in sharp contrast to those that confronted
General Yamashita in 1944 and 1945, with his troops reeling back in
disarray before the oncoming American military powerhouse.
For failure to control his forces so as to
prevent the atrocities they committed, Brig. Gens. Egbert F. Bullene and
Morris Handwerk and Maj. Gens. James A. Lester, Leo Donovan and Russel
B. Reynolds found him guilty of violating the laws of war and sentenced
him to death by hanging.
Nor did General Taylor omit the crucial link
between the military command and its political supervision
Again a much closer and more immediate
relationship in the American-Vietnamese instance than in the
Japanese-Filipino one, as the regular contact between, say, General
Creighton Abrams and Henry Kissinger makes clear:
How much the President and his close
advisers in the White House, Pentagon and Foggy Bottom knew about the
volume and cause of civilian casualties in Vietnam, and the physical
devastation of the countryside, is speculative.
Something was known, for the late John
McNaughton (then Assistant Secretary of Defense) returned from the White
House one day in 1967 with the message that,
"We seem to be proceeding on the
assumption that the way to eradicate the Vietcong is to destroy all
the village structures, defoliate all the jungles, and then cover
the entire surface of South Vietnam with asphalt."
This was noticed (by Townsend Hoopes, a
political antagonist of General Taylor's) before that metaphor had been
extended into two new countries, Laos and Cambodia, without a declaration of
war, a notification to Congress, or a warning to civilians to evacuate.
But Taylor anticipated the Kissinger case in
many ways when he recalled the trial of the Japanese statesman Koki
Hirota,
who served briefly as Prime Minister and for
several years as Foreign Minister between 1933 and May, 1938, after
which he held no office whatever.
The so-called "rape of Nanking" by Japanese
forces occurred during the winter of 1937-38, when Hirota was Foreign
Minister.
Upon receiving early reports of the
atrocities, he demanded and received assurances from the War Ministry
that they would be stopped.
But they continued, and the Tokyo tribunal
found Hirota guilty because he was,
"derelict in his duty in not insisting
before the Cabinet that immediate action be taken to put an end to
the atrocities," and "was content to rely on assurances which he
knew were not being implemented."
On this basis, coupled with his conviction
on the aggressive war charge, Hirota was sentenced to be hanged.
Melvin Laird, as secretary of defense
during the first Nixon Administration, was queasy enough about the early
bombings of Cambodia, and dubious enough about the legality or prudence of
the intervention, to send a memo to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asking,
"Are steps being taken, on a continuing
basis, to minimize the risk of striking Cambodian people and structures?
If so, what are the steps? Are we reasonably sure such steps are
effective?"
No evidence has surfaced that Henry Kissinger,
as national security adviser or secretary of state, ever sought even such
modest assurances.
Indeed, there is much evidence of his deceiving
Congress as to the true extent to which such assurances as were offered were
deliberately false.
Others involved, such as,
...have since offered varieties of apology or
contrition or at least explanation. Henry Kissinger, never.
General Taylor described the practice of air
strikes against hamlets suspected of "harboring" Vietnamese guerrillas as,
"flagrant violations of the Geneva
Convention on Civilian Protection, which prohibits `collective
penalties,' and `reprisals against protected persons,' and equally in
violation of the Rules of Land Warfare."
He was writing before this atrocious precedent
had been extended to reprisal raids that treated two whole countries - Laos
and Cambodia - as if they were disposable hamlets.
For Henry Kissinger, no great believer in the boastful claims of the war
makers in the first place, a special degree of responsibility attaches.
Not
only did he have good reason to know that field commanders were exaggerating
successes and claiming all dead bodies as enemy soldiers - a commonplace
piece of knowledge after the spring of 1968 - but he also knew that the
issue of the war had been settled politically and diplomatically, for all
intents and purposes, before he became national security adviser.
Thus he had to know that every additional
casualty, on either side, was not just a death but an avoidable death. With
this knowledge, and with a strong sense of the domestic and personal
political profit, he urged the expansion of the war into two neutral
countries - violating international law - while persisting in a
breathtakingly high level of attrition in Vietnam itself.
From a huge menu of possible examples, I have chosen cases that involve
Kissinger directly and in which I have myself been able to interview
surviving witnesses.
The first, as foreshadowed above, is Operation
"Speedy Express":
My friend and colleague Kevin Buckley, then a much admired correspondent and
Saigon bureau chief for Newsweek, became interested in the "pacification"
campaign that bore this breezy code name. Designed in the closing days of
the Johnson-Humphrey Administration, it was put into full effect in the
first six months of 1969, when Henry Kissinger had assumed much authority
over the conduct of the war.
The objective was the American disciplining, on
behalf of the Thieu government, of the turbulent Mekong Delta province of
Kien Hoa.
On January 22, 1968, Robert McNamara had told the Senate that "no regular
North Vietnamese units" were deployed in the Delta, and no military
intelligence documents have surfaced to undermine his claim, so that the
cleansing of the area cannot be understood as part of the general argument
about resisting Hanoi's unsleeping will to conquest.
The announced purpose of the Ninth Division's
sweep, indeed, was to redeem many thousands of villagers from political
control by the National Liberation Front (NLF), or "Vietcong" (VC).
As Buckley found, and as his magazine, Newsweek,
partially disclosed at the rather late date of June 19, 1972,
"All the evidence I gathered pointed to a
clear conclusion a staggering number of noncombatant civilians perhaps
as many as 5,000 according to one official-were killed by U.S. firepower
to "pacify" Kien Hoa. The death toll there made the My Lai massacre look
trifling by comparison...
The Ninth Division put all it had into the operation. Eight thousand
infantrymen scoured the heavily populated countryside, but contact with
the elusive enemy was rare. Thus, in its pursuit of pacification, the
division relied heavily on its 50 artillery pieces, 50 helicopters (many
armed with rockets and mini guns) and the deadly support lent by the Air
Force.
There were 3,381 tactical air strikes by
fighter bombers during "Speedy Express."
"Death is our business and business is
good," was the slogan painted on one helicopter unit's quarters
during the operation.
And so it was. Cumulative statistics for
"Speedy Express" show that 10,899 "enemy" were killed. In the month of
March alone,
"over 3,000 enemy troops were killed... which is the
largest monthly total for any American division in the Vietnam War,"
said the division's official magazine.
When asked to account for the
enormous body counts, a division senior officer explained that
helicopter gun crews often caught unarmed "enemy" in open fields...
There is overwhelming evidence that virtually all the Viet Cong were
well armed. Simple civilians were, of course, not armed. And the
enormous discrepancy between the body count [11,000] and the number of
captured weapons [748] is hard to explain-except by the conclusion that
many victims were unarmed innocent civilians...
The people who still live in pacified Kien Hoa all have vivid
recollections of the devastation that American firepower brought to
their lives in early 1969.
Virtually every person to whom I spoke had
suffered in some way.
"There were 5,000 people in our village
before 1969, but there were none in 1970," one village elder told
me.
"The Americans destroyed every house
with artillery, air strikes, or by burning them down with cigarette
lighters. About 100 people were killed by bombing, others were
wounded and others became refugees. Many were children killed by
concussion from the bombs which their small bodies could not
withstand, even if they were hiding underground."
Other officials, including the village
police chief, corroborated the man's testimony. I could not, of course,
reach every village. But in each of the many places where I went, the
testimony was the same 100 killed here, 700 killed there."
Other notes by Buckley and his friend and
collaborator Alex Shimkin (a worker for International Voluntary
Services who was later killed in the war) discovered the same evidence in
hospital statistics.
In March 1969, the hospital at Ben Tre reported
343 patients injured by "friendly" fire and 25 by "the enemy," an
astonishing statistic for a government facility to record in a guerrilla war
in which suspected membership in the Vietcong could mean death.
And Buckley's own citation for his magazine - of
"perhaps as many as 5,000" deaths among civilians in this one sweep - is an
almost deliberate understatement of what he was told by a United States
official, who actually said that "at least 5,000" of the dead "were what we
refer to as non-combatants" - a not too exacting distinction, as we have
already seen, and as was by then well understood.
Well understood, that is to say, not just by those who opposed the war but
by those who were conducting it.
As one American official put it to Buckley,
"The actions of the Ninth Division in
inflicting civilian casualties were worse [than My Lai]. The sum total
of what the 9th did was overwhelming. In sum, the horror was worse than
My Lai. But with the 9th, the civilian casualties came in dribbles and
were pieced out over a long time.
And most of them were inflicted from
the air and at night. Also, they were sanctioned by the command's
insistence on high body-counts... The result was an inevitable outcome
of the unit's command policy."
The earlier sweep that had mopped up My Lai -
during Operation "Wheeler Wallawa" - had also at the time counted all
corpses as those of enemy soldiers, including the civilian population of the
village, who were casually included in the mind-bending overall total of
10,000.
Confronted with this evidence, Buckley and Shimkin abandoned a lazy and
customary usage and replaced it, in a cable to Newsweek headquarters in New
York, with a more telling and scrupulous one.
The problem was not "indiscriminate use of
firepower" but "charges of quite discriminating use - as a matter of policy
in populated areas."
Even the former allegation is a gross violation
of the Geneva Convention; the second charge leads straight to the dock in
Nuremberg or The Hague.
Since General Creighton Abrams publicly praised the Ninth Division for its
'work,' and drew attention wherever and whenever he could to the tremendous
success of Operation "Speedy Express," we can be sure that the political
leadership in Washington was not unaware. Indeed, the degree of
micromanagement revealed in Kissinger's memoirs quite forbids the idea that
anything of importance took place without his knowledge or permission.
Of nothing is this more true than his own individual involvement in the
bombing and invasion of neutral Cambodia and Laos.
Obsessed with the idea that Vietnamese
intransigence could be traced to allies or resources external to Vietnam
itself, or could be overcome by tactics of mass destruction, Kissinger at
one point contemplated using thermonuclear weapons to obliterate the pass
through which ran the railway link from North Vietnam to China, and at
another stage considered bombing the dikes that prevented North Vietnam's
irrigation system from flooding the country.
Neither of these measures (reported respectively
in Tad Szulc's history of Nixon-era diplomacy,
The Illusion of Peace, and by
Kissinger's former aide Roger Morris) was taken, which removes some
potential war crimes from our bill of indictment but which also gives an
indication of the regnant mentality.
There remained Cambodia and Laos, which
supposedly concealed or protected North Vietnamese supply lines.
As in the cases postulated by General Telford Taylor, there is the crime of
aggressive war and then there is the question of war crimes. In the postwar
period, or the period governed by the U.N. Charter and its related and
incorporated conventions, the United States under Democratic and Republican
administrations had denied even its closest allies the right to invade
countries that allegedly gave shelter to their antagonists.
Most famously, President Eisenhower exerted
economic and diplomatic pressure at a high level to bring an end to the
invasion of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel in October 1956.
(The British thought Egyptian president Gamal
Abdel Nasser should not control "their" Suez Canal, the French believed
Nasser to be the inspiration and source of their troubles in Algeria, and
the Israelis claimed that he played the same role in fomenting their
difficulties with the Palestinians. The United States maintained that even
if these propaganda fantasies were true, they would not retrospectively
legalize an invasion of Egypt.)
During the Algerian war of independence, the
United States had also repudiated France's claimed right to attack a town in
neighboring Tunisia that succored Algerian guerrillas, and in 1964, at the
United Nations, Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had condemned the United Kingdom
for attacking a town in Yemen that allegedly provided a rear guard for
rebels operating in its then colony of Aden.
All this law and precedent was to be thrown to the winds when Nixon and
Kissinger decided to aggrandize the notion of "hot pursuit" across the
borders of Laos and Cambodia. As William Shawcross reported in his 1979
book,
Sideshow, even before the actual territorial invasion of Cambodia, for
example, and very soon after the accession of Nixon and Kissinger to power,
a program of heavy bombardment of the country was prepared and executed in
secret.
One might with some revulsion call it a "menu"
of bombardment, since the code names for the raids were "Breakfast,"
"Lunch," "Snack," "Dinner," and "Dessert."
The raids were flown by B-52 bombers, which, it
is important to note, fly at an altitude too high to be observed from the
ground and carry immense tonnages of high explosive; they give no warning of
approach and are incapable of accuracy or discrimination. Between March 1969
and May 1970, 3,630 such raids were flown across the Cambodian frontier.
The bombing campaign began as it was to go on -
with full knowledge of its effect on civilians and flagrant deceit by Mr.
Kissinger in this precise respect.
To wit, a memorandum prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and sent to the
Defense Department and the White House stated plainly that "some Cambodian
casualties would be sustained in the operation" and that "the surprise
effect of attack could tend to increase casualties."
The target district for,
-
"Breakfast" (Base Area 353) was
inhabited, explained the memo, by about 1,640 Cambodian civilians
-
"Lunch" (Base Area 609), by 198 of them
-
"Snack" (Base Area 351), by 383
-
"Dinner" (Base Area 352), by 770
-
"Dessert" (Base Area 350), by about 120
Cambodian peasants
These oddly exact figures are enough in
themselves to demonstrate that Kissinger must have been lying when he later
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that areas of Cambodia selected
for bombing were "unpopulated."
As a result of the expanded and intensified bombing campaigns, it has been
officially estimated that as many as 350,000 civilians in Laos and 600,000
in Cambodia lost their lives. (These are not the highest estimates.)
Figures for refugees are several multiples of
that. In addition, the widespread use of toxic chemical defoliants created a
massive health crisis that naturally fell most heavily on children, nursing
mothers, the aged, and the already infirm. That crisis persists to this day.
Although this appalling war, and its appalling consequences, can and should
be taken as a moral and political crisis for American institutions, for at
least five United States presidents, and for American society, there is
little difficulty in identifying individual responsibility during this, its
most atrocious and indiscriminate stage.
Richard Nixon, as commander in chief, bears
ultimate responsibility and only narrowly escaped a congressional move to
include his crimes and deceptions in Indochina in the articles of
impeachment, the promulgation of which eventually compelled his resignation.
But his deputy and closest adviser, Henry Kissinger, was sometimes forced,
and sometimes forced himself, into a position of virtual co-presidency where
Indochina was concerned.
For example, in the preparations for the invasion of Cambodia in 1970,
Kissinger was caught between the views of his staff - several of whom
resigned in protest when the invasion began - and his need to please his
president. His president listened more to his two criminal associates - John
Mitchell and Bebe Rebozo - than he did to his secretaries of state and
defense, William Rogers and Melvin Laird, both of whom were highly skeptical
about widening the war.
On one especially charming occasion, Nixon
telephoned Kissinger, while drunk, to discuss the invasion plans.
He then put Bebe Rebozo on the line.
"The President wants you to know if this
doesn't work, Henry, it's your ass."
"Ain't that right, Bebe?" slurred the
commander in chief. (The conversation was monitored and transcribed by
one of Kissinger's soon-to-resign staffers, William Watts.)
It could be said that in this instance the
national security adviser was under considerable pressure; nevertheless, he
took the side of the pro-invasion faction and, according to the memoirs of
General William Westmoreland, actually lobbied for that invasion to
go ahead.
A somewhat harder picture is presented by former chief of staff H.R. Haldeman in his Diaries.
On December 22, 1970, he records:
Henry came up with the need to meet with the
P today with Al Haig and then tomorrow with Laird and Moorer because he
has to use the P to force Laird and the military to go ahead with the
P's plans, which they won't carry out without direct orders.
In his White House Years, Kissinger claims that
he usurped the customary chain of command whereby commanders in the field
receive, or believe that they receive, their orders from the president and
then the secretary of defense.
He boasts that he, together with Haldeman,
Alexander Haig, and Colonel Ray Sitton, evolved "both a military and a
diplomatic schedule" for the secret bombing of Cambodia.
On board Air Force One, which was on the tarmac
at Brussels airport on February 24, 1969, he writes,
"we worked out the guidelines for bombing of
the enemy's sanctuaries."
A few weeks later, Haldeman's Diaries for March
17 record:
Historic day. K[issinger]'s "Operation
Breakfast" finally came off at 2:00 PM our time. K[issinger] really
excited, as was P[resident].
The next day's entry:
K[issinger]'s "Operation Breakfast" a great
success. He came beaming in with report, very productive.
It only got better.
On April 22, 1970, Haldeman reports that Nixon,
following Kissinger into a National Security Council meeting on Cambodia,
"turned back to me with a big smile and
said, 'K[issinger]'s really having fun today, he's playing Bismarck.'"
The above is an insult to the Iron Chancellor.
When Kissinger was finally exposed in Congress
and the press for conducting unauthorized bombings, he weakly pleaded that
the raids were not all that secret, really, because Prince Sihanouk of
Cambodia had known of them.
He had to be reminded that a foreign princeling
cannot give permission to an American bureaucrat to violate the United
States Constitution. Nor, for that matter, can he give permission to an
American bureaucrat to slaughter large numbers of his "own" civilians. It's
difficult to imagine Bismarck cowering behind such a contemptible excuse.
(Prince Sihanouk, it is worth remembering, later became an abject puppet of
the Khmer Rouge.)
Colonel Sitton, the reigning expert on B-52 tactics at the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, began to notice that by late 1969 his own office was being regularly
overruled in the matter of selecting targets.
"Not only was Henry carefully screening the
raids," said Sitton, "he was reading the raw intelligence" and fiddling
with the mission patterns and bombing runs.
In other departments of Washington insiderdom,
it was also noticed that Kissinger was becoming a Stakhanovite committeeman.
Aside from the crucial 40 Committee, which
planned and oversaw all foreign covert actions, he chaired the Washington
Special Action Group (WSAG), which dealt with breaking crises; the
Verification Panel, concerned with arms control; the Vietnam Special Studies
Group, which oversaw the day-to-day conduct of the war; and the Defense
Program Review Committee, which supervised the budget of the Defense
Department.
It is therefore impossible for him to claim that he was unaware of the
consequences of the bombings of Cambodia and Laos; he knew more about them,
and in more intimate detail, than any other individual. Nor was he
imprisoned in a culture of obedience that gave him no alternative, or no
rival arguments.
Several senior members of his own staff, most
notably Anthony Lake and Roger Morris, resigned over the invasion of
Cambodia, and more than two hundred State Department employees signed a
protest addressed to Secretary of State William Rogers. Indeed, both Rogers
and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird were opposed to the secret bombing
policy, as Kissinger himself records with some disgust in his memoirs.
Congress also was opposed to an extension of the
bombing (once it had agreed to become informed of it), but even after the
Nixon-Kissinger Administration had undertaken on Capitol Hill not to
intensify the raids, there was a 21 percent increase of the bombing of
Cambodia in the months of July and August 1973. The Air Force maps of the
targeted areas show them to be, or to have been, densely populated.
Colonel Sitton does recall, it must be admitted, that Kissinger requested
the bombing avoid civilian casualties.
His explicit motive in making this request was
to avoid or forestall complaints from the government of Prince Sihanouk. But
this does no more in itself than demonstrate that Kissinger was aware of the
possibility of civilian deaths. If he knew enough to know of their
likelihood, and was director of the policy that inflicted them, and neither
enforced any actual precautions nor reprimanded any violators, then the case
against him is legally and morally complete.
As early as the fall of 1970, an independent investigator named Fred
Branfman, who spoke Lao and knew the country as a civilian volunteer,
had gone to Bangkok and interviewed Jerome Brown, a former targeting officer
for the United States Embassy in the Laotian capital of Vientiane. The man
had retired from the Air Force because of his disillusionment at the
futility of the bombing and his consternation at the damage done to
civilians and society.
The speed and height of the planes, he said,
meant that targets were virtually indistinguishable from the air. Pilots
often chose villages as targets, because they could be more readily
identified than alleged Pathet Lao guerrillas hiding in the jungle. Branfman,
whom I interviewed in San Francisco in the summer of 2000, went on to
provide this and other information to Henry Kamm and Sydney Schanberg of the
New York Times, to Ted Koppel of ABC, and to many others.
Under pressure from the United States Embassy,
the Laotian authorities had Branfman deported back to the United States,
which was probably, from their point of view, a mistake. He was able to make
a dramatic appearance on Capitol Hill on April 22, 1971, at a hearing held
by Senator Edward Kennedy's subcommittee on refugees.
His antagonist was the State Department's envoy,
William Sullivan, a former ambassador to Laos. Branfman accused him in front
of the cameras of helping to conceal evidence that Laotian society was being
mutilated by ferocious aerial bombardment.
Partly as a consequence, Congressman Pete McCloskey of California paid a
visit to Laos and acquired a copy of an internal U.S. Embassy study of the
bombing.
He also prevailed on the U.S. Air Force to
furnish him with aerial photographs of the dramatic damage. Ambassador
Sullivan was so disturbed by these pictures, some of them taken in areas
known to him, that his first reaction was to establish to his own
satisfaction that the raids had occurred after he left his post in
Vientiane.
(He was later to learn that, for his pains, his
own telephone was being tapped at Henry Kissinger's instigation, one of the
many such violations of American law that were to eventuate in the Watergate
tapping-and-burglary scandal, a scandal that Kissinger was furthermore to
plead - in an astounding outburst of vanity, deceit, and self-deceit - as
his own alibi for collusion in the 1974 Cyprus crisis.)
Having done what he could to bring the Laotian nightmare to the attention of
those whose constitutional job it was to supervise such questions, Branfman
went back to Thailand and from there to Phnom Penh, capital of Cambodia.
Having gained access to a pilot's radio, he tape-recorded the conversations
between pilots on bombing missions over the Cambodian interior.
On no occasion did they run any checks designed
to reassure themselves and others that they were not bombing civilian
targets. It had been definitely asserted, by named U.S. government
spokesmen, that such checks were run. Branfman handed the tapes to Sydney
Schanberg, whose New York Times report on them was printed just before the
Senate met to prohibit further blitzing of Cambodia (the very resolution
that was flouted by Kissinger the following month).
From there Branfman went back to Thailand and traveled north to Nakhorn
Phanom, the new headquarters of the U.S. Seventh Air Force.
Here, a war room code-named Blue Chip served as
the command and control center of the bombing campaign. Branfman was able to
pose as a new recruit just up from Saigon and ultimately gained access to
the war room itself. Consoles and maps and screens plotted the progress of
the bombardment. In conversation with the "bombing officer" on duty, he
asked if pilots ever made contact before dropping their enormous loads of
ordnance. Oh, yes, he was assured, they did.
Were they worried about hitting the innocent?
Oh, no - merely concerned about the whereabouts
of CIA "ground teams" infiltrated into the area. Branfman's report on this,
which was carried by Jack Anderson's syndicated column, was uncontroverted
by any official denial.
One reason that the American command in Southeast Asia finally ceased
employing the crude and horrific tally of "body count" was that, as in the
relatively small but specific case of Operation "Speedy Express" cited
above, the figures began to look ominous when they were counted up.
Sometimes, totals of "enemy" dead would turn out, when computed, to be
suspiciously larger than the number of claimed "enemy" in the field.
Yet the war would somehow drag on, with new
quantitative goals being set and enforced.
Thus, according to the Pentagon, the following
are the casualty figures between the first Lyndon Johnson bombing halt in
March 1968 and February 26, 1972:
The U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Refugees
estimated that in the same four-year period, rather more than 3 million
civilians were killed, injured, or rendered homeless.
In the same four-year period, the United States dropped almost 4,500,000
tons of high explosive on Indochina. (The Pentagon's estimated total for the
amount dropped in the entire Second World War is 2,044,000.)
This total does not include massive sprayings of
chemical defoliants and pesticides.
It is unclear how we count the murder or abduction of 35,708 Vietnamese
civilians by the CIA's counter-guerrilla "Phoenix program" during the first
two and a half years of the Nixon-Kissinger Administration. There may be
some "overlap."
There is also some overlap with the actions of
previous administrations in all cases. But the truly exorbitant death tolls
all occurred on Henry Kissinger's watch; were known and understood by him;
were concealed from Congress, the press, and the public by him; and were,
when questioned, the subject of political and bureaucratic vendettas ordered
by him.
They were also partly the outcome of a secretive and illegal process
in Washington, unknown even to most Cabinet members, of which Henry
Kissinger stood to be, and became, a prime beneficiary.
On that closing point one may once again cite H.R. Haldeman, who had
no further reason to lie and who had, by the time of his writing, paid for
his crimes by serving a sentence in prison.
Haldeman describes the moment in Florida when
Kissinger was enraged by a New York Times story telling some part of the
truth about Indochina:
"Henry telephoned J. Edgar Hoover in
Washington from Key Biscayne on the May morning the Times story
appeared.
According to Hoover's memo of the call, Henry said the story used
"secret information which was extraordinarily damaging." Henry went on
to tell Hoover that he "wondered whether I could make a major effort to
find out where that came from... and to put whatever resources I need to
find out who did this. l told him I would take care of this right away."
Henry was no fool, of course. He telephoned Hoover a few hours later to
remind him that the investigation be handled discreetly "so no stories
will get out."
Hoover must have smiled, but said all
right. And by five o'clock he was back on the telephone to Henry with
the report that the Times re. porter 'may have gotten some of his
information from the Southeast Asian desk of the Department of Defense's
Public Affairs Office."
More specifically, Hoover suggested the
source could be a man named Mort Halperin (a Kissinger staffer) and an.
other man who worked in the Systems Analysis Agency... According to
Hoover's memo, Kissinger,
"hoped I would follow it up as far as we
can take it and they will destroy whoever did this if we can find
him, no matter where he is."
"The last line of that memo gives an
accurate reflection of Henry's rage, as I remember it. Nevertheless,
Nixon was one hundred percent behind the wiretaps. And I was, too.
And so the program started, inspired by Henry's rage but ordered by
Nixon, who soon broadened it even further to include newsmen.
Eventually, seventeen people were wiretapped by the FBI including seven
on Kissinger's NSC staff and three on the White House staff."
And thus, the birth of the "plumbers" and of the
assault on American law and democracy that they inaugurated.
Commenting on the lamentable end of this
process, Haldeman wrote that he still believed that ex-president Nixon (who
was then still alive) should agree to the release of the remaining tapes.
But:
"This time my view is apparently not shared
by the man who was one reason for the original decision to start the
taping process. Henry Kissinger is determined to stop the tapes from
reaching the public...
Nixon made the point that Kissinger was really the one who had the most
to lose from the tapes becoming public. Henry apparently felt that the
tapes would expose a lot of things he had said that would be very
disadvantageous to him publicly.
Nixon said that in making the deal for custody of his Presidential
papers, which was originally announced after his pardon but then was
shot down by Congress, that it was Henry who called him and insisted on
Nixon's right to destroy the tapes. That was, of course, the thing that
destroyed the deal."
A society that has been "plumbed" has the right
to demand that its plumbers be compelled to make some restitution by way of
full disclosure.
The litigation to put the Nixon tapes in the
public trust is only partially complete; no truthful account of the Vietnam
years will be available until Kissinger's part in what we already know has
been made fully transparent.
Until that time, Kissinger's role in the violation of American law at the
close of the Vietnam War makes the perfect counterpart to the 1968 covert
action that helped him to power in the first place.
The two parentheses enclose a series of
premeditated war crimes that still have power to stun the imagination.
CHILE (PART I) -
STATESMAN AS HITMAN
In a famous expression of his contempt for democracy, Kissinger once
observed that he saw no reason why a certain country should be allowed to,
"go Communist due to the irresponsibility of
its own people."
The country concerned was Chile, which at the
time of this remark had a justified reputation as the most highly evolved
pluralistic democracy in the Southern Hemisphere of the Americas.
The pluralism translated, in the years of the
Cold War, into an electorate that voted about one-third conservative,
one-third socialist and Communist, and one-third Christian Democratic and
centrist.
This had made it relatively easy to keep the
Marxist element from having its turn in government, and ever since 1962 the
CIA had - as it had in Italy and other comparable nations - largely
contented itself with funding the reliable elements.
In September 1970, however, the left's candidate
actually gained a slight plurality of 36.2 percent in the presidential
elections. Divisions on the right, and the adherence of some smaller radical
and Christian parties to the left, made it a moral certainty that the
Chilean Congress would, after the traditional sixty-day interregnum, confirm
Dr. Salvador Allende as the next president.
But the very name of Allende was anathema to the
extreme right in Chile, to certain powerful corporations (notably ITT,
Pepsi-Cola, and the Chase Manhattan Bank) that did business in Chile and the
United States, and to the CIA.
This loathing quickly communicated itself to President Nixon.
He was personally beholden to Donald Kendall,
the president of Pepsi-Cola, who had given him his first international
account when, as a failed politician, he had joined a Wall Street law firm.
A series of Washington meetings, within eleven days of Allende's electoral
victory, essentially settled the fate of Chilean democracy.
After discussions with Kendall, with
David
Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan, and with CIA director Richard Helms,
Kissinger went with Helms to the Oval Office. Helms's notes of the meeting
show that Nixon wasted little breath in making his wishes known.
Allende was not to assume office.
"Not concerned risks involved. No
involvement of embassy. $10,000,000 available, more if necessary.
Full-time job - best men we have... Make the economy scream. 48 hours
for plan of action."
Declassified documents show that Kissinger - who
had previously neither known nor cared about Chile, describing it
offhandedly as "a dagger pointed at the heart of Antarctica" - took
seriously this chance to impress his boss.
A group was set up in Langley, Virginia, with
the express purpose of running a "two track" policy for Chile, one the
ostensible diplomatic one and the other - unknown to the State Department or
the U.S. ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry - a strategy of destabilization,
kidnapping, and assassination designed to provoke a military coup.
There were long- and short-term obstacles to the incubation of such an
intervention, especially in the brief interval available before Allende took
his oath of office. The long-term obstacle was the tradition of military
abstention from politics in Chile, a tradition that marked off the country
from its neighbors. Such a military culture was not to be degraded
overnight. The short-term obstacle lay in the person of one man: General
Rene Schneider.
As chief of the Chilean Army, he was adamantly
opposed to any military meddling in the electoral process. Accordingly, it
was decided at a meeting on September 18, 1970, that General Schneider had
to go.
The plan, well documented by Seymour Hersh and others, was to have him
kidnapped by extremist officers, in such a way as to make it appear that
leftist and pro-Allende elements were behind the plot. The resulting
confusion, it was hoped, would panic the Chilean Congress into denying
Allende the presidency.
A sum of $50,000 was offered around the Chilean
capital, Santiago, for any officer or officers enterprising enough to take
on this task.
Richard Helms and his director of covert
operations, Thomas Karamessines, told Kissinger that they were not
optimistic. Military circles were hesitant and divided, or else loyal to
General Schneider and the Chilean constitution.
As Helms put it in a later account of the
conversation:
"We tried to make clear to Kissinger how
small the possibility of success was."
Kissinger firmly told Helms and Karamessines to
press on in any case.
Here one must pause for a recapitulation. An unelected official in the
United States is meeting with others, without the knowledge or authorization
of Congress, to plan the kidnapping of a constitutionally minded senior
officer in a democratic country with which the United States is not at war
and with which it maintains cordial diplomatic relations.
The minutes of the meetings may have an official
look to them (though they were hidden from the light of day for long
enough), but what we are reviewing is a "hit," a piece of state-supported
terrorism.
Ambassador Edward Korry has testified that he told his embassy staff
to have nothing to do with a group styling itself Patria y Libertad, a
quasi-fascist group intent on defying the election results. He sent two
cables to Washington warning his superiors to have nothing to do with them
either. He was unaware that his own military attaches had been told to
contact the group and to keep the fact from him.
And when the outgoing president of Chile, the
Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei, announced that he was opposed to any
American intervention and would vote to confirm the legally elected Allende,
it was precisely to this gang that Kissinger turned. On September 15, 1970,
Kissinger was told of an extremist right-wing officer named General Roberto Viaux, who had ties to
Patria y Libertad and who was willing to accept the
secret American commission to remove General Schneider from the chessboard.
The term "kidnap" was still being employed at
this point and is often employed still. Kissinger's "track two" group,
however, authorized the supply of machine guns as well as tear-gas grenades
to Viaux's associates and never seem to have asked what they would do with
the general once they had kidnapped him.
Let the documents tell the story.
A CIA cable to Kissinger's "track two" group
from Santiago dated October 18, 1970, reads (with the names still blacked
out for "security" purposes and cover identities written in by hand, in my
square brackets, by the ever-thoughtful redaction service) as follows:

The full beauty of this cable traffic cannot be

must be borne in mind that the Chilean Congress was to meet to confirm
Allende as president on the twenty-fourth of that month.)

[code name Trickturn] POLICY, OBJECTIVES
AND ACTIONS WERE REVIEWED AT HIGH USG [United States Government]
LEVEL AFTERNOON 15 OCTOBER. CONCLUSIONS, WHICH ARE TO BE YOUR
OPERATIONAL GUIDE, FOLLOW:
-
IT IS FIRM AND CONTINUING POLICY THAT
ALLENDE BE OVERTHROWN BY A COUP. IT WOULD BE MUCH PREFERABLE TO HAVE
THIS TRANSPIRE PRIOR TO 24 OCTOBER BUT EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD WILL
CONTINUE VIGOROUSLY BEYOND THIS DATE. WE ARE TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE
MAXIMUM PRESSURE TOWARD THIS END UTILIZING EVERY APPROPRIATE
RESOURCE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THESE ACTIONS BE IMPLEMENTED
CLANDESTINELY AND SECURELY SO THAT THE USG AND AMERICAN HAND BE WELL
HIDDEN. WHILE THIS IMPOSES ON US A HIGH DEGREE OF SELECTIVITY IN
MAKING MILITARY CONTACTS AND DICTATES THAT THESE CONTACTS BE MADE IN
THE MOST SECURE MANNER IT DEFINITELY DOES NOT PRECLUDE CONTACTS SUCH
AS REPORTED IN SANTIAGO 544 WHICH WAS A MASTERFUL PIECE OF WORK.
[Italics added.]
-
AFTER THE MOST CAREFUL CONSIDERATION IT
WAS DETERMINED THAT A VIAUX COUP ATTEMPT CARRIED OUT BY HIM ALONE
WITH THE FORCES NOW AT HIS DISPOSAL WOULD FAIL. THUS, IT WOULD BE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR [track two] OBJECTIVES. IT WAS DECIDED THAT
[CIA] GET A MESSAGE TO VIAUX WARNING HIM AGAINST PRECIPITATE ACTION.
IN ESSENCE OUR MESSAGE IS TO STATE, "WE HAVE REVIEWED YOUR PLANS,
AND BASED ON YOUR INFORMATION AND OURS, WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT YOUR PLANS FOR A COUP AT THIS TIME CANNOT SUCCEED. FAILING,
THEY MAY REDUCE YOUR CAPABILITIES FOR THE FUTURE. PRESERVE YOUR
ASSETS. WE WILL STAY IN TOUCH. THE TIME WILL COME WHEN YOU TOGETHER
WITH ALL YOUR OTHER FRIENDS CAN DO SOMETHING. YOU WILL CONTINUE TO
HAVE OUR SUPPORT." YOU ARE REQUESTED TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE TO VIAUX
ESSENTIALLY AS NOTED ABOVE. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: (A) TO
ADVISE HIM OF OUR OPINION AND DISCOURAGE HIM FROM ACTING ALONE; (B)
CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO AMPLIFY HIS PLANNING; (C) ENCOURAGE HIM
TO JOIN FORCES WITH OTHER COUP PLANNERS SO THAT THEY MAY ACT IN
CONCERT EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER 24 OCTOBER. (N.B. SIX GAS MASKS AND
SIX CS CANNISTERS [sic] ARE BEING CARRIED TO SANTIAGO BY SPECIAL
[deleted] COURIER ETD WASHINGTON 1100 HOURS 16 OCTOBER.)
-
THERE IS GREAT AND CONTINUING INTEREST
IN THE ACTIVITIES OF TIRADO, CANALES, VALENZUELA ET AL. AND WE WISH
THEM MAXIMUM GOOD FORTUNE.
-
THE ABOVE IS YOUR OPERATING GUIDANCE. NO
OTHER POLICY GUIDANCE YOU MAY RECEIVE FROM [indecipherable: State]
OR ITS MAXIMUM EXPONENT IN SANTIAGO, ON HIS RETURN, ARE TO SWAY YOU
FROM YOUR COURSE.
-
PLEASE REVIEW ALL YOUR PRESENT AND
POSSIBLY NEW ACTIVITIES TO INCLUDE PROPAGANDA, BLACK OPERATIONS,
SURFACING OF INTELLIGENCE OR DISINFORMATION, PERSONAL CONTACTS, OR
ANYTHING ELSE YOUR IMAGINATION CAN CONJURE WHICH WILL PERMIT YOU TO
PRESS FORWARD OUR [deleted] OBJECTIVE IN A SECURE MANNER.
Finally, it is essential to read the White House
"MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION," dated October 15, 1970, to which the above
cable directly refers and of which it is a more honest summary.
Present for the "HIGH USG LEVEL" meeting were,
as noted in the heading, "Dr. Kissinger, Mr. Karamessines, Gen. Haig."
The first paragraph of their deliberations has
been entirely blacked out, with not so much as a scribble in the margin from
the redaction service. (Given what has since been admitted, this
sixteen-line deletion must be well worth reading.)
Picking up at paragraph two, we find:
-
Then Mr. Karamessines provided a
run-down on Viaux, the Canales meeting with Tirado, the latter's new
position (after Porta was relieved of command "for health reasons")
and, in some detail, the general situation in Chile from the coup
possibility viewpoint.
-
A certain amount of information was
available to us concerning Viaux's alleged support throughout the
Chilean military. We had assessed Viaux's claims carefully, basing
our analysis on good intelligence from a number of sources. Our
conclusion was clear: Viaux did not have more than one chance in
twenty - perhaps less - to launch a successful coup.
-
The unfortunate repercussions, in Chile
and internationally, of an unsuccessful coup were discussed. Dr.
Kissinger ticked off his list of these negative possibilities. His
items were remarkably similar to the ones Mr. Karamessines had
prepared.
-
It was decided by those present that the
Agency must get a message to Viaux warning him against any
precipitate action. In essence our message was to state: "We have
reviewed your plans, and based on your information and ours, we come
to the conclusion that your plans for a coup at this time cannot
succeed. Failing, they may reduce your capabilities for the future.
Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. The time will come when
you with all your other friends can do something. You will continue
to have our support."
-
After the decision to de-fuse the Viaux
coup plot, at least temporarily, Dr. Kissinger instructed Mr.
Karamessines to preserve Agency assets in Chile, working
clandestinely and securely to maintain the capability for Agency
operations against Allende in the future. [Italics added.]
-
Dr. Kissinger discussed his desire that
the word of our encouragement to the Chilean military in recent
weeks be kept as secret as possible. Mr. Karamessines stated
emphatically that we had been doing everything possible in this
connection, including the use of false flag officers, car meetings
and every conceivable precaution. But we and others had done a great
deal of talking recently with a number of persons. For example,
Ambassador Korry's wide-ranging discussions with numerous people
urging a coup "cannot be put back into the bottle." [Three lines of
deletion follow.] (Dr. Kissinger requested that copy of the message
be sent to him on 16 October.)
-
The meeting concluded on Dr. Kissinger's
note that the Agency should continue keeping the pressure on every
Allende weak spot in sight - now, after the 24th of October, after 5
November, and into the future until such time as new marching orders
are given. Mr. Karamessines stated that the Agency would comply.
So "track two" contained two tracks of its own.
"Track two/one" was the group of ultras led by
General Roberto Viaux and his sidekick, Captain Arturo Marshal. These men
had tried to bring off a coup in 1969 against the Christian Democrats; they
had been cashiered and were disliked even by conservatives in the officer
corps.
"Track two/two" was a more ostensibly
"respectable" faction headed by General Camilo Valenzuela, the chief of the
garrison in the capital city, whose name occurs in the cables above and
whose identity is concealed by some of the deletions. Several of the CIA
operatives in Chile felt that Viaux was too much of a madman to be trusted.
And Ambassador Korry's repeated admonitions also had their effect.
As shown in the October 15 memo cited above,
Kissinger and Karamessines developed last-minute second thoughts about Viaux,
who as late as October 13 had been given $20,000 in cash from the CIA
station and promised a life-insurance policy of $250,000. This offer was
authorized directly from the White House.
With only days to go, however, before Allende
was inaugurated, and with Nixon repeating that,
"it was absolutely essential that the
election of Mr. Allende to the presidency be thwarted,"
...the pressure on the Valenzuela group became
intense.
As a direct consequence, especially after the
warm words of encouragement he had received, General Roberto Viaux felt
himself under some obligation to deliver and to disprove those who had
doubted him.
On the evening of October 19, 1970, the Valenzuela group, aided by some of
Viaux's gang, and equipped with the tear-gas grenades delivered by the CIA,
attempted to grab General Schneider as he left an official dinner. The
attempt failed because Schneider left in a private car and not the expected
official one.
The failure produced an extremely significant
cable from CIA headquarters in Washington to the local station, asking for
urgent action because,
"HEADQUARTERS MUST RESPOND DURING MORNING 20
OCTOBER TO QUERIES FROM HIGH LEVELS."
Payments of $50,000 each to Valenzuela and his
chief associate were then authorized on condition that they make another
attempt.
On the evening of October 20 they did. But again
there was only failure to report. On October 22 the "sterile" machine guns
mentioned above were handed to Valenzuela's group for yet another try. Later
that same day, General Roberto Viaux's gang finally murdered General Rene
Schneider.
According to the later verdict of the Chilean military courts, this atrocity
partook of elements of both tracks of "track two." In other words,
Valenzuela was not himself on the scene, but the assassination squad, led by
Viaux, contained men who had participated in the preceding two attempts.
Viaux was convicted on charges of kidnapping and of conspiring to cause a
coup.
Valenzuela was convicted of the charge of
conspiracy to cause a coup. So any subsequent attempt to distinguish the two
plots from each other, except in point of degree, is an attempt to confect a
distinction without a difference.
It scarcely matters whether Schneider was slain because of a kidnapping
scheme that went awry (he was said by the assassins to have had the temerity
to resist) or whether his assassination was the objective in the first
place. The Chilean military police report, as it happens, describes a
straightforward murder. Under the law of every law-bound country (including
the United States), a crime committed in the pursuit of a kidnapping is
thereby aggravated, not mitigated.
You may not say, with a corpse at your feet,
"I was only trying to kidnap him."
At least, you may not say so if you hope to
plead extenuating circumstances.
Yet a version of "extenuating circumstances" has become the paper-thin cover
story with which Kissinger has since protected himself from the charge of
being an accomplice, before and after the fact, in kidnapping and murder.
And this sorry euphemism has even found a refuge in the written record.
The Senate intelligence committee, in its
investigation of the matter, concluded that since the machine guns supplied
to Valenzuela had not been actually employed in the killing, and since
General Viaux had been officially discouraged by the CIA a few days before
the murder, there was therefore "no evidence of a plan to kill Schneider or
that United States officials specifically anticipated that Schneider would
be shot during the abduction."
Walter Isaacson, in his biography of Kissinger, takes at face value a memo
from Kissinger to Nixon after his meeting on October 15 with Karamessines,
in which he reports to the president about the Viaux plot, saying that he
had "turned it off." He also takes at face value the claim that Viaux's
successful hit was essentially unauthorized.
These excuses and apologies are as logically
feeble as they are morally contemptible.
Henry Kissinger bears direct responsibility for
the Schneider murder, as the following points demonstrate:
-
Bruce MacMaster, one of the "False Flag"
agents mentioned in the cable traffic above, a career CIA man
carrying a forged Colombian passport and claiming to represent
American business interests in Chile, has told of his efforts to get
"hush money" to jailed members of the Viaux group, after the
assassination and before they could implicate the agency.
-
Colonel Paul M. Wimert, a military
attache in Santiago and chief CIA liaison with the Valenzuela
faction, has testified that after the Schneider killing he hastily
retrieved the two payments of $50,000 that had been paid to
Valenzuela and his partner, and also the three "sterile" machine
guns. He then drove rapidly to the Chilean seaside town of Vina del
Mar and hurled the guns into the ocean. His accomplice in this
action, CIA station chief Henry Hecksher, had assured Washington
only days before that either Viaux or Valenzuela would be able to
eliminate Schneider and thereby trigger a coup.
-
Look again at the White House/Kissinger
memo of October 15 and at the doggedly literal way it is
retransmitted to Chile. In no sense of the term does it "turn off"
Viaux. If anything, it incites him - a well-known and boastful
fanatic - to redouble his efforts. "Preserve your assets. We will
stay in touch. The time will come when you with all your other
friends can do something. You will continue to have our support."
This is not exactly the language of standing him down. The remainder
of the cable speaks plainly of the intention to "DISCOURAGE HIM FROM
ACTING ALONE," to "CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO AMPLIFY HIS
PLANNING," and to "ENCOURAGE HIM TO JOIN FORCES WITH OTHER COUP
PLANNERS SO THAT THEY MAY ACT IN CONCERT EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER 24
OCTOBER." (Italics added.) The last three stipulations are an
entirely accurate, not to say prescient, description of what Viaux
actually did.
-
Consult again the cable received by
Henry Hecksher on October 20, referring to anxious queries "from
high levels" about the first of the failed attacks on Schneider.
Thomas Karamessines, when questioned by the Senate intelligence
committee about the same phrase in a similar cable sent to another
CIA agent in Santiago, testified of his certainty that the term
"high levels" referred directly to Kissinger. In all previous
communications from Washington, as a glance above will show, that
had indeed been the case. This on its own is enough to demolish
Kissinger's claim to have "turned off" "track two" (.and its
interior tracks) on October 15.
-
Ambassador Edward Korry later made the
obvious point that Kissinger was attempting to build a paper alibi
in the event of a failure by the Viaux group: "His interest was not
in Chile but in who was going to be blamed for what. He wanted me to
be the one who took the heat. Henry didn't want to be associated
with a failure, and he was setting up a record to blame the State
Department. He brought me in to the President because he wanted me
to say what I had to say about Viaux; he wanted me to be the soft
man."
The concept of "deniability" was not as well
understood in Washington in 1970 as it has since become.
But it is clear that Henry Kissinger wanted two
things simultaneously: He wanted the removal of General Schneider, by any
means and employing any proxy. (No instruction from Washington to leave
Schneider unharmed was ever given; deadly weapons were sent by diplomatic
pouch, and men of violence were carefully selected to receive them.)
And he wanted to be out of the picture in case
such an attempt might fail, or be uncovered. These are the normal motives of
anyone who solicits or suborns murder. Kissinger, however, needed the crime
very slightly more than he needed, or was able to design, the deniability.
Without waiting for his many hidden papers to be
released or subpoenaed, we can say with safety that he is prima facie guilty
of direct collusion in the murder of a constitutional officer in a
democratic and peaceful country.
CHILE (PART II) - DEATH IN
THE SOUTH
On November 9, 1970, Henry Kissinger authored
National Security Council Decision Memorandum 93, which reviewed policy
toward Chile in the immediate wake of Salvador Allende's confirmation as
president.
Various routine measures of economic harassment
were proposed (as per Nixon's instruction to "make the economy scream"),
with cutoffs in aid and investment. More significantly, Kissinger advocated
that "close relations" be maintained with military leaders in neighboring
countries, in order to facilitate both the coordination of pressure against
Chile and the incubation of opposition within the country.
In outline, this prefigures the disclosures that
have since been made about
Operation "Condor,"
a secret collusion among
military dictatorships across the hemisphere, operated with the United
States government's knowledge and indulgence.
The actual overthrow of the Allende government in a sanguinary coup d'etat
took place on September 11, 1973, while Kissinger was going through his own
Senate confirmation process as secretary of state. He falsely assured the
Foreign Relations Committee that the United States government had played no
part in the coup.
From a thesaurus of hard information to the
contrary, one might select Situation Report No. 2, from the Navy Section of
the United States Military Group in Chile and written by U.S. Naval Attaché
Patrick J. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan describes his close relationship with
the officers engaged in overthrowing the government, hails September 11,
1973, as "our D-Day," and observes with satisfaction that,
"Chile's coup de etat [sic] was close to
perfect."
Or one may peruse the declassified files on
"Project FUBELT"- the code name under which the CIA, in frequent contact
with Kissinger and the 40 Committee, conducted covert operations against the
legal and elected government of Chile.
What is striking, and what points to a much more direct complicity in
individual crimes against humanity, is the microscopic detail in which
Kissinger kept himself informed, after the coup, of Augusto Pinochet's
atrocities. On November 16, Assistant Secretary of State Jack B. Kubisch
delivered a detailed report on the Chilean junta's execution policy, which,
as he notes to the new secretary, "you requested by cable from Tokyo."
The memo goes on to enlighten Kissinger in
various ways about the first nineteen days of Pinochet's rule. Summary
executions during that period, we are told, totaled 320. (This contrasts
with the publicly announced total of 100 and is based on "an internal,
confidential report prepared for the junta" to which American officials are
evidently privy.) Looking on the bright side,
On November 14, we announced our second CCC credit to Chile $24 million for
feed corn. Our long-standing commitment to sell two surplus destroyers to
the Chilean navy has met a reasonably sympathetic response in Senate
consultations. The Chileans, meanwhile, have sent us several new re' quests
for controversial military equipment.
Kubisch then raises the awkward question of two American citizens murdered
by the junta - Frank Teruggi and Charles Horman - details of whose precise
fate are still, more than a quarter century later, being sought by their
families.
The reason for the length of the search may be
inferred from a telegram, dated February 11, 1974, which reports on a
meeting with the junta's foreign minister and notes that Kubisch raises the
matter of the missing Americans
"IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEED TO BE CAREFUL TO
KEEP RELATIVELY SMALL ISSUES IN OUR RELATIONSHIP FROM MAKING OUR
COOPERATION MORE DIFFICULT."
To return, via this detour, to Operation
"Condor":
"Condor" was a machinery of cross-border
assassination, abduction, torture, and intimidation coordinated among
the secret police forces of Pinochet's Chile, Alfredo Stroessner's
Paraguay, Jorge Rafael Videla's Argentina, and other regional caudillos.
This internationalization of the death-squad
principle is now known to have been responsible for,
-
the murder of the dissident general
Carlos Prats of Chile (and his wife) in Buenos Aires
-
the murder of the Bolivian general Juan
Jose Torres, also in Argentina
-
the maiming of a Christian Democratic
Chilean senator, Bernardo Leighton, in Italy,
...to name only the most salient victims.
A "Condor" team also detonated a car bomb in
downtown Washington, D.C., in September 1976, killing the former Chilean
foreign minister, Orlando Letelier, and his aide, Ronni Moffitt.
United States government complicity has been
uncovered at every level of this network.
It has been established, for example, that the
FBI aided Pinochet in capturing Jorge Isaac Fuentes de Alarcon, who was
detained and tortured in Paraguay, then turned over to the Chilean secret
police and "disappeared." Astonishingly, the surveillance of Latin American
dissident refugees in the United States was promised to "Condor" figures by
American intelligence.
And what of Kissinger?
All of the above-cited crimes, and many more
besides, were committed on his "watch" as secretary of state. And all of
them were and are punishable under local or international law or both. It
can hardly be argued, by himself or by his defenders, that he was
indifferent to, or unaware of, the true situation. In 1999 a secret
memorandum was declassified, giving excruciating details of a private
conversation between Kissinger and Pinochet in Santiago, Chile, on June 8,
1976.
The meeting took place the day before Kissinger
was due to address the Organization of American States.
The subject was human rights. Kissinger was at
some pains to explain to Pinochet that the few pro forma remarks he was to
make on that topic were by no means to be taken seriously.
My friend Peter Kornbluh has performed
the service of comparing the "Memcon" (Memorandum of Conversation) with the
account of the meeting given by Kissinger himself in his third volume of
apologia, Years of Renewal:
The Memoir: A considerable amount of time in
my dialogue with Pinochet was devoted to human rights, which were, in
fact, the principal obstacle to close United States relations with
Chile. I outlined the main points in my speech to the OAS which I would
deliver the next day. Pinochet made no comment.
The Memcon: I will treat human rights in general terms, and human rights
in a world context. I will refer in two paragraphs to the report on
Chile of the OAS Human Rights Commission. I will say that the human
rights issue has impaired relations between the U.S. and Chile. This is
partly the result of Congressional actions.
I will add that I hope you will shortly
remove these obstacles... I can do no less, without producing a reaction
in the U.S. which would lead to legislative restrictions. The speech is
not aimed at Chile. I wanted to tell you about this. My evaluation is
that you are a victim of all left-wing groups around the world and that
your greatest sin was that you overthrew a government that was going
Communist.
The Memoir: As Secretary of State, I felt I had the responsibility to
encourage the Chilean government in the direction of greater democracy
through a policy of understanding. Pinochet's concerns...
Pinochet
reminded me that,
"Russia supports their people 100 percent. We are
behind you. You are the leader. But you have a punitive system for your
friends."
I returned to my underlying theme that any major help from us
would realistically depend on progress on human rights.
The Memcon: There is merit in what you say. It is a curious time in the
U.S... It is unfortunate. We have been through Viet Nam and Watergate.
We have to wait until the [1976] elections. We welcomed the overthrow of
the Communist-inclined government here. We are not out to weaken your
position.
In an unpleasant way, Pinochet twice mentioned
the name of Orlando Letelier the exiled Chilean opposition leader, accusing
him of misleading the United States Congress.
Kissinger's response, as can be seen, was to
apologize for the Congress and (in a minor replay of his 1968 Paris tactic
over Vietnam) to suggest that the dictator hope for better days after the
upcoming elections.
Three months later, a car bomb in Washington
killed Letelier, the only such outrage ever committed in the nation's
capital by agents of a foreign regime (and an incident completely absent
from Kissinger's memoirs). The man responsible for arranging the crime, the
Chilean secret policeman General Manuel Contreras, has since stated in an
affidavit that he took no action without specific and personal orders from
Pinochet.
He remains in prison, doubtless wondering why he
trusted his superiors.
"I want to see our relations and friendship
improve," Kissinger told Pinochet (but not the readers of his memoirs).
"We want to help, not undermine you."
In advising a murderer and despot, whose rule he
had helped impose, to disregard his upcoming remarks as a sop to Congress,
Kissinger insulted democracy in both countries.
He also gave the greenest of green lights to
further cross-border and internal terrorism, neither of which could have
been unknown to him. (In his memoirs, he does mention what he calls
Pinochet's "counter-terrorist intelligence agency.")
Further colluding with Pinochet against the
United States Congress, which was considering cutting off arms sales to
human-rights violators via the Kennedy Amendment, Kissinger obsequiously
remarked,
"I don't know if you listen in on my phone,
but if you do you have just heard me issue instructions to Washington to
[defeat the Kennedy Amendment] if we defeat it, we will deliver the
F-5Es as we agreed to do."
The foregoing passage is worth bearing in mind.
It is a good key for decoding the usual
relationship between fact and falsehood in Kissinger's ill-crafted memoir.
(And it is a huge reproach to his editors at Simon & Schuster, and
Weidenfeld & Nicolson.) It should also act as an urgent prompting to members
of Congress, and to human-rights organizations, to reopen the incomplete
inquiries and thwarted investigations into the multifarious crimes of this
period.
Finally, and read in the light of Chile's return
to democracy and the decision of the Chilean courts to pursue truth and
justice, it repudiates Kissinger's patronizing insult concerning the
"irresponsibility" of a dignified and humane people, who have suffered very
much more than verbal insult at his hands.
A rule of thumb in Washington holds that any late disclosure by officialdom
will ,~ contain material that is worse than even the cynics suspected.
In September 2000, however,
the CIA disgorged
the results of an internal inquiry on Chile, which had been required of it
by the Hinchey Amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act for that
fiscal year.
And the most hardened critics and investigators
were reduced to amazement:
"Support for Coup in 1970. Under "Track lI"
of the strategy, CIA sought to instigate a coup to prevent Allende from
taking office after he won a plurality in the 4 September election and
before, as Constitutionally required because he did not win an absolute
majority, the Chilean Congress reaffirmed his victory.
CIA was working with three different groups
of plotters. All three groups made it clear that any coup would require
the kidnapping of Army Commander Rene Schneider, who felt deeply that
the Constitution required that the Army allow Allende to assume power.
CIA agreed with that assessment.
Although CIA provided weapons to one of the
groups, we have found no information that the plotters' or ClA's
intention was for the general to be killed. Contact with one group of
plotters was dropped early an because of its extremist tendencies. CIA
provided tear gas, submachine-guns and ammunition to the second group,
mortally wounding him in the attack.
CIA had previously encouraged this group to
launch a coup but withdrew support four days before the attack because,
in ClA's assessment, the group could not carry it out successfully."
This repeats the old canard supposedly
distinguishing a kidnapping or abduction from a murder, and once again
raises the intriguing question:
What was the CIA going to do with General
Schneider once it had kidnapped him?
(Note also, the studied passivity whereby
the report "found no information that the plotters' or CIA's intention
was for the general to be killed." What would satisfy this bizarre
criterion?)
But then we learn of the supposedly unruly gang
that actually took its instructions seriously:
"In November 1970 a member of the Viaux
group who avoided capture recontacted the Agency and requested financial
assistance on behalf of the group. Although the Agency had no obligation
to the group because it acted on its own, in an effort to keep the prior
contact secret, maintain the good will of the group, and for
humanitarian reasons, $35,000 was passed."
"Humanitarian reasons."
One has to admire the sheer inventiveness of
this explanation.
At 1970 prices, $35,000 was, in Chile, a
considerable sum. Not likely the sort of sum that a local station chief
could have disbursed on his own. One wants to know how the 40 Committee and
its vigilant chairman, Henry Kissinger, decided that the best way to
dissociate from a supposedly loose-cannon gang was to pay it a small fortune
in cash after it had committed a cold-blooded murder.
The same question arises in an even more acute form with another disclosure
made by the CIA in the course of the same report. This is headed
"Relationship with Contreras."
Manuel Contreras was the head of Pinochet's
secret military police, and in that capacity organized the death, torture,
and "disappearance" of innumerable Chileans as well as the use of bombing
and assassination techniques as far afield as Washington, D.C.
The CIA
admits early on in the document that it,
"had liaison relationships in Chile with the
primary purpose of securing assistance in gathering intelligence on
external targets. The CIA offered these services assistance in internal
organization and training to combat subversion and terrorism from
abroad, not in combating internal opponents of the government."
Such flat prose, based on a distinction between
the "external targets" and the more messy business of internal dictatorial
discipline, invites the question: What external threat?
Chile had no foreign enemy except Argentina,
which disputed some sea-lane rights in the Beagle Channel. (In consequence,
Chile helped Mrs. Thatcher in the Falklands war of 1982.) And in Argentina,
as we know, the CIA was likewise engaged in helping the military regime to
survive. No, Chile had no external enemies to speak of, but the Pinochet
dictatorship had many, many external foes.
They were the numerous Chileans forced to
abandon their country. Manuel Contreras's job was to hunt them down.
As the report puts it,
"During a period between 1974 and 1977, CIA
maintained contact with Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who later became
notorious for his involvement in human rights abuses. The U.S.
Government policy community approved ClA's contact with Contreras, given
his position as chief of the primary intelligence organization in Chile,
as necessary to accomplish the ClA's mission, in spite of concerns that
this relationship might lay the CIA open to charges of aiding internal
political repression."
After a few bits of back-and-forth about the
distinction without a difference (between "external" and "internal" police
tactics), the CIA report states candidly,
"By April 1975, intelligence reporting
showed that Contreras was the principal obstacle to a reasonable human
rights policy within the Junta, but an interagency committee directed
the CIA to continue its relationship with Contreras.
The U.S. Ambassador to Chile urged Deputy
Director of Central Intelligence [General Vernon] Walters to receive
Contreras in Washington in the interest of maintaining good relations
with Pinochet. In August 1975, with interagency approval, this meeting
took place.
In May and June 1975, elements within the CIA recommended establishing a
paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his
unique position and access to Pinochet. This proposal was overruled,
citing the U.S. Government policy on clandestine relations with the head
of an intelligence service notorious for human rights abuses.
However, given miscommunications in the
timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras."
This does not require too much parsing.
Some time after it had been concluded, and by
the CIA at that, that Manuel Contreras was the "principal obstacle to a
reasonable human rights policy," he is given American taxpayers' money and
received at a high level in Washington.
The CIA's memorandum is careful to state that,
where doubts exist, they are stilled by the "U.S. Government policy
community" and by "an interagency committee." It also tries to suggest, with
unconscious humor, that the head of a murderous foreign secret service was
given a large bribe by mistake. One wonders who was reprimanded for this
blunder, and how it got past the scrutiny of the 40 Committee.
The report also contradicts itself, stating at one point that Contreras's
activities overseas were opaque and at another that,
"[w]ithin a year after the coup, the CIA and
other U.S. Government agencies were aware of bilateral cooperation among
regional intelligence services to track the activities of and, in at
least a few cases, kill political opponents. This was the precursor to
Operation Condor, an intelligence-sharing arrangement among Chile,
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay established in 1975."
So now we know:
The internationalization of the death-squad
principle was understood and approved by American intelligence and its
political masters across two administrations.
The senior person concerned in both
administrations was Henry Kissinger.
Whichever "interagency committee" is meant, and
whether it is the 40 Committee or the interagency committee on Chile, we are
led back to the same source.
On leaving the State Department, Kissinger made an extraordinary bargain
whereby he gifted his papers to the Library of Congress (having first
hastily trucked them for safekeeping to the Rockefeller estate at Pocantico
Hills, New York) on the sole condition that they remain under seal until
five years after his death.
Kissinger's friend Manuel Contreras, however,
made a mistake when he killed an American citizen, Ronni Karpen Moffitt,
in the Washington car bomb that also murdered Orlando Letelier in 1976. By
late 2000, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had finally sought and
received subpoena power to review the Library of Congress papers, a subpoena
with which Kissinger dealt only through his attorneys.
It was a start, but it was pathetic when
compared with the efforts of truth-and-justice commissions in Chile,
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, which have now emerged from years
of Kissinger befriended dictatorship and are seeking a full accounting.
We await the moment when the United States
Congress will inaugurate a comparable process and finally subpoena all the
hidden documents that obscure the view of unpunished crimes committed in our
names.
CYPRUS - A TURBULENT
PRIEST
In the second volume of his trilogy of memoirs, Years of Upheaval,
Henry Kissinger found the subject of the 1974 Cyprus catastrophe so awkward
that he decided to postpone consideration of it:
"I must leave a full discussion of the
Cyprus episode to another occasion, for it stretched into the Ford
Presidency and its legacy exists unresolved today."
This argued a certain nervousness on his part,
if only because the subjects of Vietnam, Cambodia, the Middle East, Angola,
Chile, China, and the SALT negotiations all bear legacies that are
"unresolved today" and were unresolved then.
(To say that these matters "stretched into the
Ford Presidency" is to say, in effect, nothing at all except that this
pallid interregnum did, historically speaking, occur.)
In most of his writing about himself (and, one presumes, in most of his
presentations to his clients) Kissinger projects a strong impression of a
man at home in the world and on top of his brief. But there are a number of
occasions when it suits him to pose as a sort of Candide, naive and ill
prepared and easily unhorsed by events. No doubt this pose costs him
something in self-esteem.
It is a pose, furthermore, that he often adopts
at precisely the time when the record shows him to be knowledgeable and when
knowledge or foreknowledge would also confront him with charges of
responsibility or complicity.
Cyprus in 1974 is just such a case.
Kissinger now argues, in the third volume of his
memoirs, Years of Renewal, that he was prevented and distracted, by
Watergate and the deliquescence of the Nixon presidency, from taking a
timely or informed interest in the crucial triangle of Greece, Turkey, and
Cyprus.
This is a bizarre disclaimer:
the phrase "eastern flank of NATO" was
then a geopolitical commonplace of the first importance, and the proximity
of Cyprus to the Middle East was a factor never absent from American
strategic thinking.
There was no reason of domestic policy to
prevent the region from engaging his attention.
Furthermore, the very implosion of Nixonian
authority, cited as a reason for Kissinger's own absence of mind, in fact
bestowed extraordinary powers upon him. To restate the obvious once more:
When he became secretary of state in 1973, he took care to retain his post
as "special assistant to the president for national security affairs," or,
as we now say, national security adviser.
This made him the first and only secretary of
state to hold the chairmanship of the 40 Committee, which, of course,
considered and approved covert actions by the CIA. Meanwhile, as chairman of
the National Security Council, he held a position in which every important
intelligence plan passed across his desk.
His former NSC aide, Roger Morris, was not
exaggerating by much, if at all, when he said that Kissinger's dual
position, plus Nixon's eroded one, made him,
"no less than acting chief of state for
national security."
Kissinger gives one hostage to fortune in Years
of Upheaval and another in Years of Renewal.
In the former volume he says, quite plainly:
"I had always taken it for granted that the
next communal crisis in Cyprus would provoke Turkish intervention" -
i.e., would at least risk the prospect of a war within NATO between
Greece and Turkey and would certainly involve the partition of the
island.
That this was indeed common knowledge may
not be doubted by any person even lightly acquainted with Cypriot
affairs.
In the latter volume, wherein Kissinger finally takes up the
challenge implicitly refused in the first volume, he repeatedly asks the
reader why anyone (such as himself, so burdened with Watergate) would
have sought "a crisis in the eastern Mediterranean between two NATO
allies."
These two disingenuous statements need to be
qualified in the light of a third one, which appears on page 199 of Years of
Renewal.
Here, President Makarios of Cyprus is
described without adornment as "the proximate cause of most of Cyprus's
tensions." Makarios was the democratically elected leader of a virtually
unarmed republic, which was at the time in an association agreement with the
European Economic Community, as well as a member of the United Nations and
of the Commonwealth.
His rule was challenged, and the independence of
Cyprus threatened, by a military dictatorship in Athens and a highly
militarized government in Turkey, both of which sponsored right-wing
gangster organizations on the island, and both of which had plans to annex
the greater or lesser part of it.
In spite of this, "intercommunal" violence had
been on the decline in Cyprus throughout the 1970s. Most killings were, in
fact, "intramural": of Greek and Turkish democrats or internationalists by
their respective nationalist and authoritarian rivals. Several attempts, by
Greek and Greek Cypriot fanatics, had been made on the life of President
Makarios himself.
To describe his person as the "proximate cause"
of most of the tensions is to make a wildly aberrant moral judgment.
This same aberrant judgment, however, supplies the key that unlocks the lie
at the heart of Kissinger's chapter. If the elected civilian authority (and
spiritual leader of the Greek Orthodox community) is the "proximate cause"
of the tensions, then his removal from the scene is self-evidently the cure
for them. If one can demonstrate that there was such a removal plan, and
that Kissinger knew about it in advance, then it follows logically and
naturally that he was not ostensibly looking for a crisis-as he
self-pityingly asks us to disbelieve-but for a solution.
The fact that he got a crisis, which was also a
hideous calamity for Cyprus and the region, does not change the equation or
undo the syllogism.
The scheme to remove Makarios, on which the
"solution" depended, was in practice a failure. But those who willed the
means and wished the ends are not absolved from guilt by the refusal of
reality to match their schemes.
It is, from Kissinger's own record and recollection, as well as the
subsequent official inquiry, quite easy to demonstrate that he did have
advance knowledge of the plan to depose and kill Makarios. He admits as much
himself, by noting that the Greek dictator Dimitrios Ioannides, head
of the secret police, was determined to mount a coup in Cyprus and bring the
island under the control of Athens.
This was one of the better-known facts of the
situation, as was the more embarrassing fact that Brigadier Ioannides was
dependent on American military aid and political sympathy. His police state
had long since been expelled from the Council of Europe and blocked from
joining the EEC, and it was largely the advantage conferred by his agreement
to "home port" the U.S. Sixth Fleet, and host a string of U.S. air force and
intelligence bases, that kept him in power.
This lenient policy was highly controversial in
Congress and in the American press, and the argument over it was part of
Kissinger's daily bread long before the Watergate drama.
Thus it was understood in general that the Greek dictatorship, an American
client, wished to see Makarios overthrown and had already tried to kill him
or have him killed. (Overthrow and assassination, incidentally, are
effectively coterminous in this account; there was no possibility of leaving
such a charismatic leader alive, and those who sought his removal invariably
intended his death.)
This was also understood in particular.
The most salient proof is this:
In May of 1974, two months before the coup
in Cyprus's capital, Nicosia, which Kissinger later claimed came as a
shock to him, he received a memorandum from the head of his State
Department Cyprus desk, Thomas Boyatt.
Boyatt summarized all the cumulative and
persuasive reasons for believing that a Greek junta attack on Cyprus and
Makarios was imminent.
He further argued that, in the absence of an
American demarche to Athens, warning the dictators to desist, it might be
assumed that the United States was indifferent to this. And he added what
everybody knew: that such a coup, if it went forward, would beyond doubt
trigger a Turkish invasion.
Prescient memos are a dime a dozen in Washington after a crisis; they are
often then read for the first time, or leaked to the press or to Congress in
order to enhance (or protect) some bureaucratic reputation. But Kissinger
now admits that he saw this document in real time, while engaged in his
shuttle between Syria and Israel (both of them within half an hour's flying
time of Cyprus).
Yet no demarche bearing his name or carrying his authority
was issued to the Greek junta.
A short while afterward, on June 7, 1974, the National Intelligence Daily,
which is the breakfast-table reading of all senior State Department,
Pentagon, and national security officials, cited an American field report,
dated June 3, that stated the views of the dictator in Athens:
"loannides claimed that Greece is capable of
removing Makarios and his key supporters from power in twenty-four hours
with little if any blood being shed and without EOKA assistance. [EOKA
was a Greek-Cypriot fascist underground, armed and paid by the junta.]
The Turks would quietly acquiesce to the
removal of Makarios, a key enemy... Ioannides stated that if Makarios
decides on some type of extreme provocation against Greece to obtain a
tactical advantage, he (loannides) is not sure whether he should merely
pull the Greek troops out of Cyprus and let Makarios fend for himself,
or remove Makarios once and for all and have Greece deal directly with
Turkey over Cyprus' future."
This report and its contents were later
authenticated before Congress by CIA staff who had served in Athens at the
relevant time.
The fact that it made Brigadier Ioannides seem
bombastic and delusional-both of which he was- should have underlined the
obvious and imminent danger.
At about the same time, Kissinger received a call from Senator J. William
Fulbright, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator
Fulbright had been briefed about the impending coup by a senior Greek
dissident journalist in Washington named Elias P. Demetracopoulos.
According to Demetracopoulos, Fulbright told
Kissinger that steps should be taken to avert the planned Greek action, and
he gave three reasons. The first was that it would repair some of the moral
damage done by America's indulgence of the junta. The second was that it
would head off a confrontation between Greece and Turkey in the
Mediterranean.
The third was that it would enhance American
prestige on the island. Kissinger declined to take the recommended steps, on
the bizarre grounds that he could not intervene in Greek "internal affairs"
at a time when the Nixon Administration was resisting pressure from Senator
Henry Jackson to link U.S.-Soviet trade to the free emigration of Russian
Jewry.
However odd this line of argument, it still
makes it quite impossible for Kissinger to claim, as he still does, that he
had had no warning.
So there was still no American high-level concern registered with Athens.
The difficulty is sometimes presented as one of protocol or etiquette, as if
Kissinger's regular custom was to whisper and tread lightly. Ioannides was
the de facto head of the regime but technically only its secret police
chief.
For the U.S. ambassador, Henry Tasca, it was awkward to make
diplomatic approaches to a man he described as "a cop."
But again I remind you that Henry Kissinger, in
addition to his formal diplomatic eminence, was also head of the 40
Committee, and therefore the supervisor of American covert action, and was
dealing in private with an Athens regime that had long-standing ties to the
CIA.
The 1976 House Committee on Intelligence later
phrased the problem rather deftly in its report:
"Tasca, assured by the CIA station chief
that loannides would continue to deal only with the CIA, and not sharing
the State Department desk officer's alarm, was content to pass a message
to the Greek leader indirectly... It is clear, however, that the Embassy
took no steps to underscore for loannides the depth of U.S. concern over
a Cyprus coup attempt.
This episode, the exclusive CIA access to
loannides, Tasca's indications that he may not have seen all important
messages to and from the CIA Station, loannides' suggestions of U.S.
acquiescence, and Washington's well-known coolness to Makarios have led
to public speculation that either U.S. officials were inattentive to the
reports of the developing crisis or simply allowed it to happen..."
Thomas Boyatt's memoranda, warning of precisely
what was to happen (and echoing the views of several mid-level officials
besides himself), were classified as secret and still have never been
released.
Asked to testify at the above hearings, he was
at first forbidden by Kissinger to appear before Congress and was finally
permitted to do so only in order that he might avoid a citation for
contempt. His evidence was taken in Executive Session, with the hearing room
cleared of staff, reporters, and visitors.
Matters continued to gather pace. On July 1, 1974, three senior officials of
the Greek foreign ministry, all of them known for their moderate views on
the Cyprus question, publicly tendered their resignations.
On July 3, President Makarios made public an
open letter to the Greek junta, which made the direct accusation of foreign
interference and subversion:
"In order to be absolutely clear, I say that
the cadres of the military regime of Greece support and direct the
activities of the EOKA-B terrorist organization... I have more than once
so far felt, and some cases I have almost touched, a hand invisibly
extending from Athens and seeking to liquidate my human existence."
He called for the withdrawal from Cyprus of the
Greek officers responsible.
Some days after the coup, which eventually occurred on July 15, 1974, and
when challenged at a press conference about his apparent failure to foresee
or avert it, Kissinger replied that "the information was not Iying around on
the streets."
Actually, it nearly was. It had been available
to him round the clock, in both his diplomatic and intelligence capacities.
His decision to do nothing was therefore a direct decision to do something,
or to let something be done.
To the rest of the world, two things were obvious about the coup. The first
was that it had been instigated from Athens and carried out with the help of
regular Greek forces, and was thus a direct intervention in the internal
affairs of one country by another. The second was that it violated all the
existing treaties governing the status of the island.
The obvious and unsavory illegality was luridly
emphasized by the junta itself, which chose a notorious chauvinist gunman
named Nikos Sampson to be its proxy "president." Sampson must have been well
known to the chairman of the 40 Committee as a long-standing recipient of
financial support from the CIA; he also received money for his fanatical
Nicosia newspaper Makli ("Combat") from a pro-junta CIA proxy in Athens, Mr.
Savvas Constantopoulos, the publisher of the pro-junta organ Eleftheros
Kosmos ("Free World").
No European government treated Sampson as
anything but a pariah during the brief nine days in which he held power and
launched a campaign of murder against his democratic Greek opponents.
But Kissinger told the American envoy in Nicosia
to receive Sampson's "foreign minister" as foreign minister, thus making the
United States the first and only government to extend de facto recognition.
(At this point, it might be emphasized, the
whereabouts of President Makarios were unknown. His palace had been heavily
shelled and his death announced on the junta's radio. He had in fact made
his escape, and was able to broadcast the fact a few days afterward-to the
enormous irritation of certain well-placed persons.)
In Washington, Kissinger's press spokesman, Robert Anderson, flatly denied
that the coup- later described by Makarios from the podium of the United
Nations as "an invasion"-constituted foreign intervention.
"No," he replied to a direct question on
this point. "In our view there has been no outside intervention."
This surreal position was not contradicted by
Kissinger when he met with the Cypriot ambassador and failed to offer the
customary condolences on the reported death of his president-the "proximate
cause," we now learn from him, of all the unpleasantness.
When asked if he still recognized the elected
Makarios government as the legal one, Kissinger doggedly and astonishingly
refused to answer. When asked if the United States was moving toward
recognition of the Sampson regime, his spokesman declined to deny it.
When Senator Fulbright helped facilitate a visit
by the escaped Makarios to Washington, the State Department was asked
whether he would be received by Kissinger,
"as a private citizen, as Archbishop, or as
President of Cyprus?" The answer? "[Kissinger]'s meeting with Archbishop
Makarios on Monday."
Every other government in the world, save the
rapidly collapsing Greek dictatorship, recognized Makarios as the legitimate
head of the Cyprus republic.
Kissinger's unilateralism on the point is
without diplomatic precedent and argues strongly for his collusion and
sympathy with the armed handful who felt the same way.
It is worth emphasizing that Makarios was invited to Washington in the first
place, as elected and legal president of Cyprus, by Senator William J.
Fulbright of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and by his counterpart,
Congressman Thomas Morgan, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Credit for their invitation belongs to the above-mentioned Elias Demetracopoulos, who had long warned of the coup and who was a friend of
Fulbright's.
It was he who conveyed the invitation to
Makarios, who was by then in London meeting with the British foreign
secretary. This initiative crowned a series of anti-junta activities by this
guerrilla journalist and one-man band, who had already profoundly irritated
Kissinger and become a special object of his spite. At the very last moment,
and with a very poor grace, Kissinger was compelled to announce that he was
receiving Makarios in his presidential and not his episcopal capacity.
Since Kissinger himself tells us that he had always known or assumed that
another outbreak of violence in Cyprus would trigger a Turkish military
intervention, we can assume in our turn that he was not surprised when such
an intervention came.
Nor does he seem to have been very much
disconcerted. While the Greek junta remained in power, his efforts were
principally directed to shielding it from retaliation. He was opposed to the
return of Makarios to the island and strongly opposed to Turkish or British
use of force to undo the Greek coup (Britain being a guarantor power with a
treaty obligation and troops on Cyprus).
This same counsel of inertia or inaction-amply
testified to in Kissinger's own memoirs as well as everyone
else's-translated later into equally strict and repeated admonitions against
any measures to block a Turkish invasion. Sir Tom McNally, then the chief
political adviser to Britain's then foreign secretary and future prime
minister, James Callaghan, has since disclosed that Kissinger "vetoed" at
least one British military action to preempt a Turkish landing.
This may seem paradoxical, but the long-standing sympathy for a partition of
Cyprus, repeatedly expressed by the State and Defense departments, make it
seem much less so.
The demographic composition of the island (82
percent Greek, 18 percent Turkish) made it more logical for the partition to
be imposed by Greece. But a second best was to have it imposed by Turkey.
And once Turkey had conducted two brutal invasions and occupied almost 40
percent of Cypriot territory, Kissinger exerted himself very strongly indeed
to protect Turkey from any congressional reprisal for this outright
violation of international law and promiscuous and illegal misuse of
American weaponry.
He became so pro-Turkish, in fact, that it was
if he had never heard of the Greek colonels (though his expressed dislike of
the returned Greek democratic leaders supplied an occasional reminder).
Not all the elements of this partitionist policy can be charged to Kissinger
personally; he inherited the Greek junta and the official dislike of
Makarios. Even in the dank obfuscatory prose of his own memoirs, however, he
does admit what can otherwise be concluded from independent sources.
Using covert channels, and short-circuiting the
democratic process in his own country, he made himself a silent accomplice
in a plan of political assassination, and when this plan went awry it led to
the deaths of thousands of civilians, the violent uprooting of almost
200,000 refugees, and the creation of an unjust and unstable amputation of
Cyprus that constitutes a serious threat to peace a full quarter century
later.
On July 10, 1976, the European Commission of Human Rights adopted a report,
prepared by eighteen distinguished jurists and chaired by Professor J.E.S.
Fawcett, resulting from a year's research into the consequences of the
Turkish invasion. It found that the Turkish army had engaged in the
deliberate killing of civilians, in the execution of prisoners, in the
torture and ill-treatment of detainees, in the arbitrary collective
punishment and mass detention of civilians, and in systematic and unpunished
acts of rape, torture, and looting.
A large number of "disappeared" persons, both
prisoners of war and civilians, are still "missing" from this period. This
number included a dozen holders of United States passports, which is
evidence in itself of an indiscriminate strategy when conducted by an army
dependent on American aid and materiel.
Perhaps it was a reluctance to accept his responsibility for these outrages,
as well as his responsibility for the original Sampson coup, that led
Kissinger to tell a bizarre sequence of lies to his new friends, the
Chinese. On October 2, 1974, he held a high-level meeting in New York with
Qiao Guanhua, vice foreign minister of the People's Republic.
It was the first substantive Sino-American
meeting since the visit of Deng Xiaoping, and the first order of business
was Cyprus.
The memorandum, which is headed "TOP
SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY," has Kissinger first rejecting
China's public claim that he had helped engineer the removal of Makarios.
"We did not. We did not oppose Makarios" (a
claim belied by his own memoirs). He says, "When the coup occurred I was
in Moscow," which he was not.
He says,
"My people did not take these intelligence
reports [concerning an impending coup] seriously," even though they had.
He says that neither did Makarios take them
seriously, even though Makarios had gone public in a denunciation of the
Greek junta for its coup plans.
He then makes the amazing claim that "we knew
the Soviets had told the Turks to invade," which would make this the first
Soviet-instigated invasion to be conducted by a NATO army and paid for with
American aid.
A good liar must have a good memory. Kissinger is a stupendous liar with a
remarkable memory. So perhaps some of this hysterical lying is explained by
its context: the need to enlist China's anti-Soviet instincts.
But the total of falsity is so impressive that
it suggests something additional, something more like denial or delusion, or
even a confession by other means.
BLOODBATH IN
BANGLADESH
Cyprus was not the first instance in which a perceived need to mollify China
outweighed even the most minimal concern for human life elsewhere.
On April 6, 1971, a cable of protest was written
from the United States Consulate in what was then East Pakistan, the Bengali
"wing" of the Muslim state of Pakistan, known to its restive nationalist
inhabitants by the name Bangladesh. The cable's senior signatory, the consul
general in Dhaka, was named Archer Blood, though it might have become known
as the Blood Telegram in any case.
Sent directly to Washington, its purpose was,
quite simply, to denounce the complicity of the United States government in
genocide.
Its main section read:
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO DENOUNCE THE
SUPPRESSION OF DEMOCRACY. OUR GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO TAKE FORCEFUL
MEASURES TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BENDING OVER
BACKWARDS TO PLACATE THE WEST PAKISTAN-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT.
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS EVIDENCED WHAT MANY WILL
CONSIDER MORAL BANKRUPTCY, IRONICALLY AT A TIME WHEN THE USSR SENT
PRESIDENT YAHYA KHAN A MESSAGE DEFENDING DEMOCRACY, CONDEMNING THE
ARREST OF A LEADER OF A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED MAJORITY PARTY...
BUT WE HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO INTERVENE, EVEN
MORALLY, ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE AWAMI CONFLICT, IN WHICH UNFORTUNATELY
THE OVERWORKED TERM GENOCIDE IS APPLICABLE, IS PURELY AN INTERNAL MATTER
OF A SOVEREIGN STATE. PRIVATE AMERICANS HAVE EXPRESSED DISGUST.
WE, AS PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC SERVANTS, EXPRESS
OUR DISSENT WITH CURRENT POLICY AND FERVENTLY HOPE THAT OUR TRUE AND
LASTING INTERESTS HERE CAN BE DEFINED AND OUR POLICIES REDIRECTED...
This was signed by twenty members of the United
States' diplomatic equipe in Bangladesh and, on its arrival at the State
Department, by a further nine senior officers in the South Asia division.
It was the most public and the most strongly
worded demarche, from State Department servants to the State Department,
that has ever been recorded.
The circumstances fully warranted the protest. In December 1970, the
Pakistani military elite had permitted the first open elections in a decade.
The vote was easily won by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the
Bengali-based Awami League, who gained a large overall majority in the
proposed National Assembly. (In the East alone, it won 167 out of 169
seats.) This, among other things, meant a challenge to the political and
military and economic hegemony of the Western "wing."
The National Assembly had been scheduled to meet
on March 3, 1971. On March 1, General Yahya Khan, head of the supposedly
outgoing military regime, postponed its convening, which resulted in mass
protests and nonviolent civil disobedience in the East.
On March 25,1971, the Pakistani army struck at the Bengali capital of Dhaka.
Having arrested and kidnapped Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, and taken him to West Pakistan, it set about massacring his
supporters. The foreign press had been preemptively expelled from the city,
but much of the direct evidence of what then happened was provided via a
radio transmitter operated by the American consulate.
Archer Blood himself supplied an account of one
episode directly to the State Department and to Henry Kissinger's National
Security Council. Having readied the ambush, Pakistani regular soldiers set
fire to the women's dormitory at the university and then mowed the occupants
down with machine guns as they sought to escape. (The guns, along with all
the other weaponry, had been furnished under American military-assistance
programs.)
Other reports, since amply vindicated, were supplied to the London Times and
Sunday Times by the courageous reporter Anthony Mascarenhas and flashed
around a horrified world.
Rape, murder, dismemberment, and the state
murder of children were employed as deliberate methods of repression and
intimidation. At least 10,000 civilians were butchered in the first three
days. The eventual civilian death toll has never been placed at less than
half a million and has been put as high as 3 million.
Since almost all Hindu citizens were at risk by
definition from Pakistani military chauvinism (not that Pakistan's Muslim
co-religionists were spared), a vast movement of millions of
refugees-perhaps as many as 10 million-began to cross the Indian frontier.
To summarize, then: first, the direct negation
of a democratic election; second, the unleashing of a genocidal policy;
third, the creation of a very dangerous international crisis. Within a short
time, Ambassador Kenneth Keating, the ranking American diplomat in New
Delhi, had added his voice to those of the dissenters. It was a time, he
told Washington, when a principled stand against the authors of this
aggression and atrocity would also make the best pragmatic sense.
Keating, a former senator from New York, used a
very suggestive phrase in his cable of March 29,1971, calling on the
administration to,
"PROMPTLY, PUBLICLY AND PROMINENTLY DEPLORE
THIS BRUTALITY."
It was,
"MOST IMPORTANT THESE ACTIONS BE TAKEN NOW,"
he warned, "PRIOR TO INEVITABLE AND IMMINENT EMERGENCE OF HORRIBLE
TRUTHS."
Nixon and Kissinger acted quickly.
That is to say, Archer Blood was immediately
recalled from his post, and Ambassador Keating was described by the
president to Kissinger, with some contempt, as having been "taken over by
the Indians." In late April 1971, at the very height of the mass murder,
Kissinger sent a message to General Yalya Khan, thanking him for his
"delicacy and tact."
We now know of one reason why the general was so favored at a time when he
had made himself-and his patrons-responsible for the grossest crimes against
humanity. In April 1971, an American Ping-Pong team had accepted a surprise
invitation to compete in Beijing, and by the end of that month, using the
Pakistani ambassador as an intermediary, the Chinese authorities had
forwarded a letter inviting Nixon to send an envoy.
Thus there was one motive of realpolitik for the
shame that Nixon and Kissinger were to visit on their own country for its
complicity in the extermination of the Bengalis.
Those who like to plead realpolitik, however, might wish to consider some
further circumstances. There already was, and had been for some time, a
"back channel" between Washington and Beijing. It ran through Nicolae
Ceausescu's Romania; not a decorative choice but not, at that stage, a
positively criminal one.
To a serious person like Chou En-Lai, there was
no reason to confine approaches to the narrow channel afforded by a
blood-soaked (and short-lived, as it turned out) despot like the delicate
and tactful Yabya Khan. Either Chou En-Lai wanted contact, in other words,
or he did not.
As Lawrence Lifschultz, the primary
historian of this period, has put it:
"Winston Lord, Kissinger's deputy at the
National Security Council, stressed to investigators the internal
rationalization developed within the upper echelons of the
Administration. Lord told [the staff of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace] "We had to demonstrate to China we were a reliable
government to deal with. We had to show China that we respect a mutual
friend."
How, after two decades of belligerent
animosity with the People's Republic, mere support for Pakistan in its
bloody civil war was supposed to demonstrate to China that the U.S. "was
a reliable government to deal with" was a mystifying proposition which
more cynical observers of the events, both in and outside the U.S.
government, consider to have been an excuse justifying the simple
convenience of the Islamabad link-a link which Washington had no
overriding desire to shift."
Second, the knowledge of this secret diplomacy
and its accompanying privileges obviously freed the Pakistani general of
such restraints as might have inhibited him.
He told his closest associates, including his
minister of communications, G.W. Choudhury, that his private understanding
with Washington and Beijing would protect him.
Choudhury later wrote,
"If Nixon and Kissinger had not given him
that false hope, he'd have been more realistic."
Thus the collusion with him in the matter of
China increases the direct complicity of Nixon and Kissinger in the
massacres.
Only a reopened congressional inquiry with subpoena power could determine
whether there was any direct connection, apart from the self-evident ones of
consistent statecraft attested by recurring and reliable testimony, between
the secret genocidal diplomacy of 1971 and the secret destabilizing
diplomacy of 1975.
The task of disproving such a connection,
meanwhile, would appear to rest on those who believe that everything is an
accident.
TIMOR MORTIS
One small but significant territory has the distinction of being
omitted-entirely omitted-from Henry Kissinger's memoirs.
And since East Timor is left out of the third
and final volume (Years of Renewal) it cannot hope, like Cyprus, for a hasty
later emendation. It has, in short, been airbrushed.
The date of the Indonesian invasion of this small neighboring
country-December 7, 1975-is significant. On that date, President Gerald Ford
and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, arrived in Hawaii, having
concluded an official visit to Jakarta.
Since they had come fresh from a meeting with
Indonesia's military junta, and since the United States was Indonesia's
principal supplier of military hardware (Portugal, a NATO ally, had broken
relations with Indonesia on the point), it seemed reasonable to inquire
whether the two leaders had given the invaders any impression amounting to a
"green light."
The president was evasive:
"When he landed at Hawaii, reporters asked
Mr. Ford for comment on the invasion of Timor.
He smiled and said:
"We'll talk about that later."
But press secretary Ron Nessen later gave
reporters a statement saying:
"The United States is always concerned
about the use of violence. The President hopes it can be resolved
peacefully."
The literal incoherence of this official
utterance-a peaceful resolution to a use of violence - may perhaps have
possessed an inner coherence: the hope of a speedy victory for overwhelming
force.
Kissinger moved this suspicion a shade nearer to
actualization in his own more candid comment, which was offered while he was
still on Indonesian soil.
He told the press in Jakarta that the United
States would not recognize the republic declared by FRETILIN (Revolutionary
Front for the Liberation of East Timor) and that,
"the United States understands Indonesia's
position on the question."
So gruesome were the subsequent reports of mass
slaughter, rape, and deliberate starvation that bluntness fell somewhat out
of fashion.
The killing of several Australian journalists
who had witnessed Indonesia's atrocities, the devastation in the capital
city of Dili, and the stubbornness of FRETILIN's hugely outgunned rural
resistance made East Timor an embarrassment to, rather than an advertisement
for, Jakarta's new order.
Kissinger generally attempted to avoid any
discussion of his involvement in the extirpation of the Timorese - an
ongoing involvement, since he authorized backdoor shipments of weapons to
those doing the extirpating-and was ably seconded in this by his ambassador
to the United Nations, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who later confided in
his memoir, A Dangerous Place, that in the matter of East Timor the
initial invasion toll was,
"almost the proportion of casualties
experienced by the Soviet Union during the Second World War."
Moynihan continued:
"[T]he United States wished things to turn
out as they did, and worked to bring this about. The Department of State
desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever
measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it
forward with no inconsiderable success."
The terms "United States" and "Department of
State" are here foully prostituted, by this supposed prose master, since
they are used as synonyms for Henry Kissinger.
Twenty years later, on July 11, 1995, Kissinger was confronted with direct
questions on the subject. Publicizing and promoting his then latest book,
Diplomacy, at an event sponsored by The Learning Exchange at the Park
Central Hotel in New York City, he perhaps (having omitted Timor from his
book and from his talk) did not anticipate the first line of questioning
that arose from the floor.
Constancio Pinto, a former resistance leader in
Timor who had been captured and tortured and had escaped to the United
States, opened the bidding:
PINTO: I am Timorese. My name is Constancio
Pinto. And I followed your speech today and it's really interesting. One
thing that I know you didn't mention is this place invaded by Indonesia
in 1975. It is in Southeast Asia. As a result of the invasion 200,000
people of the Timorese were killed. As far as I know Dr. Kissinger was
in Indonesia the day before the invasion of East Timor. The United
States actually supported Indonesia in East Timor. So I would like to
know what you were doing at that time.
KISSINGER: What was I doing at that time ? The whole time or just about
Timor?... What most people who deal with government don't understand is
one of the most overwhelming experiences of being in high office. That
there are always more problems than you can possibly address at any one
period. And when you're in global policy and you're a global power,
there are so many issues....We had at that time, there was a war going
on in Angola.
We had just been driven out of Vietnam.
We were conducting negotiations in the
Middle East, and Lebanon had blown up. We were on a trip to China.
Maybe, regrettably, we weren't ever thinking about Timor. I'm telling
you what the truth of the matter is. The reason we were in Indonesia was
actually accidental. We had originally intended to go to China, we
meaning President Ford and myself and some others. We had originally
intended to go to China for five days. This was the period when Mao was
very sick and there had been an upheaval in China... So we cut our trip
to China short....
Timor was never discussed with us when we were in Indonesia. At the
airport as we were leaving, the Indonesians told us that they were going
to occupy the Portuguese colony of Timor. To us that did not seem like a
very significant event, because the Indians had occupied the Portuguese
colony of Goa ten years earlier, and to us it looked like another
process of decolonization. Nobody had the foggiest idea of what would
happen afterwards, and nobody asked our opinion, and I don't know what
we could have said if someone had asked our opinion....
Now there's been a terrible human tragedy in Timor afterwards. The
population of East Timor has resisted, and I don't know whether the
casualty figures are correct. I just don't know, but they're certainly
significant, and there's no question that it's a huge tragedy. All I'm
telling you is what we knew in 1975. This was not a big thing on your
radar screen. Nobody has ever heard again of Goa after the Indians
occupied it...
And to us, Timor, look at a map, it's a
little speck of an island in a huge archipelago, half of which was
Portuguese. We had no reason to say the Portuguese should stay there....
ALLAN NAIRN: Mr. Kissinger, my name is Allan Nairn. I'm a journalist in
the United States. I'm one of the Americans who survived the massacre in
East Timor on November 12, 1991, a massacre during which Indonesian
troops armed with American M-16s gunned down at least 271 Timorese
civilians in front of the Santa Cruz Catholic cemetery as they were
gathered in the act of peaceful mourning and protest.
Now you just said that in your meeting with
Suharto on the afternoon of December 6, 1975, you did not discuss Timor,
you did not discuss it until you came to the airport. Well, I have here
the official State Department transcript of your and President Ford's
conversation with General Suharto, the dictator of Indonesia...
It has been edited under the Freedom of
Information Act, so the whole text isn't there. It's clear from the
portion of the text that is here that in fact you did discuss the
impending invasion of Timor with Suharto, a fact which was confirmed to
me by President Ford himself in an interview I had with him.
President
Ford told me that in fact you discussed the impending invasion of Timor
with Suharto and that you gave the U.S....
KISSINGER: Who? I or he?
NAIRN: That you and President Ford together gave U.S. approval for the
invasion of East Timor. There is another internal State Department
memo... This is a memo of a December 18 1975, meeting held at the State
Department.
This was held right after your return from
that trip, and you were berating your staff for having put on paper a
finding by the State Department legal adviser Mr. Leigh that the
Indonesian invasion of East Timor was illegal, that it not only violated
international law, it violated a treaty with the U.S. because U.S.
weapons were used, and it's clear from this transcript, which I invite
anyone in the audience to peruse, that you were angry at them first
because you feared this memo would leak and second because you were
supporting the Indonesian invasion of East Timor...
If one looks at the public actions, sixteen
hours after you left that meeting with Suharto the Indonesian troops
began parachuting over Dili, the capital of East Timor. They came ashore
and began the massacres that culminated in a third of the Timorese
population [being killed]. You announced an immediate doubling of U.S.
military aid to Indonesia at the time....
KISSINGER: Look, I think we all got the point...
NAIRN: My question, Mr. Kissinger, my question, Dr. Kissinger, is
twofold: First, will you give a waiver under the Privacy Act to support
full declassification of this memo so we can see exactly what you and
President Ford said to Suharto? Secondly, would you support the
convening of an international war-crimes tribunal under U.N. supervision
on the subject of East Timor, and would you agree to abide by its
verdict in regard to your own conduct?
KISSINGER: I mean, uh, really, this sort of comment is one of the
reasons why the conduct of foreign policy is becoming nearly impossible
under these conditions. Here is a fellow who's got one obsession...
he collects a bunch of documents, you don't know what is in these
documents...
NAIRN: I invite your audience to read them.
It's interesting to notice the final
decomposition of Kissinger's normally efficient if robotic syntax in that
final answer.
It's also interesting to see, once again, the
operations of his denial mechanism. If Kissinger and his patron Nixon were
identified with any one core belief, it was that the United States should
never be, or even appear to be, a "pitiful, helpless giant."
Kissinger's own writings and speeches are
heavily larded with rhetoric about "credibility" and the need to impress
both friend and foe with the mettle of American resolve. Yet, in response to
any inquiry that might implicate him in crime and fiasco, he rushes to
humiliate his own country and its professional servants, suggesting that
they know little, care less, are poorly informed, and are easily rattled by
the pace of events. He also resorts to a demagogic isolationism.
This is as much as to claim that the United
States is a pushover for any ambitious or irredentist banana republic.
This semiconscious reversal of rhetoric also leads to renewed episodes of
hysterical and improvised lying. (Recall his claim to the Chinese that it
was the Soviets who had instigated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.) The idea
that Indonesia's annexation of Timor may be compared to India's occupation
of Goa is too absurd to have been cited in any apologia before or since.
What Kissinger seems to like about the
comparison is the rapidity with which Goa was forgotten.
What he overlooks is that it was forgotten
because,
-
it was not a bloodbath on the scale of
Timor
-
it completed the decolonization of India
Timor represented the cementing of colonization
by Indonesia.
And, quite clearly, an Indonesian invasion that
began a few hours after Kissinger had left the tarmac at Jakarta airport
must have been planned and readied several days before he arrived. Such
plans would have been known by any embassy military attaché and certainly by
any visiting secretary of state.
We have, in fact, the word of C. Philip
Liechty, a former CIA operations officer in Indonesia, that,
"Suharto was given the green light to do
what he did. There was discussion in the embassy and in traffic with the
State Department about the problems that would be created for us if the
public and Congress became aware of the level and type of military
assistance that was going to Indonesia at that time...Without continued
heavy U.S. logistical military support the Indonesians might not have
been able to pull it off."
The desire to appear to have been uninvolved
may-if we are charitable arise in part from the fact that even Indonesia's
foreign minister, Adam Malik, conceded in public a death toll of between
50,000 and 80,000 Timorese civilians in the first eighteen months of
Indonesia's war of subjugation:
in other words, on Kissinger's watch, and
inflicted with weapons that he bent American laws to furnish to the
killers.
Now that a form of democracy has returned to
Indonesia, which in its first post-dictatorial act renounced the annexation
of East Timor and - after a bloody last pogrom by its auxiliaries - withdrew
from the territory, we may be able to learn more exactly the extent of the
quasi-genocide.
Kissinger's arrogance in 1975 did not dispose of two matters of legality,
both of them in the province of the State Department.
The first was the violation of international law
by Indonesia, in a case where jurisdiction clearly rested with a Portuguese
and NATO government of which Kissinger (partly as a result of its support
for "decolonization") did not approve. The second was the violation of
American law, which stipulated that weapons supplied to Indonesia were to be
employed only in self-defense.
State Department officials, bound by law, were
likewise bound to conclude that United States aid to the generals in Jakarta
would have to be cut off.
Their memo summarizing this case was the cause
of the tremendous internal row that is minuted below:
SECRET/SENSITIVE MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION
Participants:
-
The Secretary [Henry Kissinger]
-
Deputy Secretary [Robert] Ingersoll
-
Under Secretary [for Political
Affairs Joseph] Sisco
-
Under Secretary [Carlyle] Maw
-
Deputy Under Secretary [Lawrence]
Eagleburger

Jerry Bremer, Notetaker
Date: December 18, 1975
Subject: Department Policy
The Secretary [Kissinger]: I want to raise a little bit of hell about
the Department's conduct in my absence. Until last week I thought we had
a disciplined group; now we've gone to pieces completely. Take this
cable on Timor. You know my attitude and anyone who knows my position as
you do must know that I would not have approved it. The only consequence
is to put yourself on record. It is a disgrace to treat the Secretary of
State this way....
What possible explanation is there for it? I had told you to stop it
quietly. What is your place doing, Phil, to let this happen? It is
incomprehensible....
Habib: Our assessment was that if it was going to be trouble, it would
come up before your return. And I was told they decided it was desirable
to go ahead with the cable.
The Secretary: Nonsense. I said do it for a few weeks and then open up
again.
Habib: The cable will not leak.
The Secretary: Yes it will and it will go to Congress too and then we
will have hearings on it.
Habib: I was away. I was told by cable that it had come up.
The Secretary: That means that there are two cables! And that means
twenty guys have seen it.
Habib: No, I got it back channel-it was just one paragraph double talk
and cryptic so l knew what it was talking about. I was told that Leigh
thought that there was a legal requirement to do it.
Leigh: No, I said it could be done administratively. It was not in our
interest to do it on legal grounds.
Sisco: We were told that you had decided we had to stop.
The Secretary: Just a minute, just a minute. You all know my view on
this... No one has complained that it was aggression.
Leigh: The Indonesians were violating an agreement with us.
The Secretary: The Israelis when they go into Lebanon-when was the last
time we protested that?
Leigh: That's a different situation.
Maw: It is self-defense.
The Secretary: And we can't construe a Communist government in the
middle of Indonesia as self-defense ?
Leigh: Well...
The Secretary: Then you're saying that arms can't be used for defense?
Habib: No, they can be used for the defense of Indonesia.
The Secretary: Now take a look at this basic theme that is coming out on
Angola. These SOBs are leaking all of this stuff to [New York Times
reporter] Les Gelb.
Sisco: I can tell you who.
The Secretary: Who?
Sisco: [National Security Council member William] Hyland spoke to him.
The Secretary: Wait a minute-Hyland said . . .
Sisco: He said he briefed Gelb.
The Secretary: I want these people to know that our concern in Angola is
not the economic wealth or a naval base. It has to do with the USSR
operating 8,000 miles from home when all the surrounding states are
asking for our help. This will affect the Europeans, the Soviets, and
China.
On the Timor thing, that will leak in three months, and it will come out
that Kissinger overruled his pristine bureaucrats and violated the law.
[Italics added.] How many people in L [the legal adviser's office] know
about this?
Leigh: Three.
Habib: There are at least two in my office.
The Secretary: Plus everybody in the meeting so you're talking about not
less than 15 or 20.
You have a responsibility to recognize that we are living in a
revolutionary situation. Everything on paper will be used against me.
Habib: We do that and take account of that all the time....
The Secretary: Every day some SOB in the Department is carrying on about
Angola but no one is defending Angola. Find me one quote in the Gelb
article defending our policy in Angola.
Habib: I think the leaks and dissent are the burden you have to bear....
The Secretary: ...This is not minor league stuff. We are going to lose
big. The President says to the Chinese that we're going to stand firm in
Angola and two weeks later we get out. I go to a NATO meeting and
meanwhile the Department leaks that we're worried about a naval base and
says it's an exaggeration or aberration of
Kissinger's. I don't care about the oil or the base but I do care about
the African reaction when they see the Soviets pull it off and we don't
do anything... The Chinese will say we're a country that was run out of
Indochina for 50,000 men and is now being run out of Angola for less
than $50 million...
The Secretary: It cannot be that our agreement with Indonesia says that
the arms are for internal purposes only. I think you will find that it
says that they are legitimately used for self-defense.
There are two problems. The merits of the case which you had a duty to
raise with me. The second is how to put these to me. But to put it into
a cable 30 hours before I return, knowing how cables are handled in this
building, guarantees that it will be a national disaster and that
transcends whatever [Deputy Legal Adviser George] Aldrich has in his
feverish mind.
I took care of it with the administrative thing by ordering Carlyle
[Maw] not to make any new sales.
How will the situation get better in six weeks?
Habib: They may get it cleaned up by then.
The Secretary: The Department is falling apart and has reached the point
where it disobeys clear cut orders.
Habib: We sent the cable because we thought it was needed and we thought
it needed your attention. This was ten days ago.
The Secretary: Nonsense. When did I get the cable, Jerry?
Bremer: Not before the weekend. I think perhaps on Sunday.
The Secretary: You had to know what my view on this was. No one who has
worked with me in the last two years could not know what my view would
be on Timor.
Habib: Well, let us look at it-talk to Leigh. There are still some legal
requirements. I can't understand why it went out if it was not legally
required.
The Secretary: Am I wrong in assuming that the Indonesians will go up in
smoke if they hear about this ?
Habib: Well, it's better than a cutoff. It could be done at a low level.
The Secretary: We have four weeks before Congress comes back. That's
plenty of time.
Leigh: The way to handle the administrative cutoff would be that we are
studying the situation.
The Secretary: And 36 hours was going to be a major problem?
Leigh: We had a meeting in Sisco's office and decided to send the
message.
The Secretary: I know what the law is but how can it be in the U.S.
national interest for us to give up on Angola and kick the Indonesians
in the teeth? Once it is on paper, there will be a lot of FSO-6's who
can make themselves feel good who can write for the Open Forum Panel on
the thing even though I will turn out to be right in the end.
Habib: The second problem on leaking of cables is different.
The Secretary: No it's an empirical fact.
Eagleburger: Phil, it's a fact. You can't say that any NODIS ["No
Distribution": the most restricted level of classification] cable will
leak bur you can't count on three to six months later someone asking for
it in Congress. If it's part of the written record, it will be dragged
out eventually.
The Secretary: You have an obligation to the national interest. l don't
care if we sell equipment to Indonesia or not. l get nothing from it. ~
get no rake-off. But you have an obligation to figure out how to serve
your country. The Foreign Service is not to serve itself. The Service
stands for service to the United States and not service to the Foreign
Service.
Habib: I understand that that's what this cable would do.
The Secretary: The minute you put this into the system you cannot
resolve it without a finding.
Leigh: There's only one question. What do we say to Congress if we're
asked?
The Secretary: We cut it off while we are studying it. We intend to
start again in January.
Nobody, it must be said, comes out of this
meeting especially well; the secretary's civil servants were anything but
"pristine."
Still it can be noted of Kissinger that, in
complete contrast to his public statements, he,
-
forbore from any mention of Goa
-
did not trouble to conceal his long-held
views on the matter, berating his underlings for being so dense as
not to know them
-
did not affect to be taken by surprise
by events in East Timor
-
admitted that he was breaking the law
-
felt it necessary to deny that he could
profit personally from the arms shipments, a denial for which nobody
had asked him
That Kissinger understood Portugal's continuing
legal sovereignty in East Timor is shown by a NODIS memorandum of a Camp
David meeting between himself, General Suharto, and President Ford on the
preceding July 5,1975.
Almost every line of the text has been deleted
by official redaction, and much of the discussion is un-illuminating except
about the eagerness of the administration to supply naval, air, and military
equipment to the junta, but at one point, just before Kissinger makes his
entrance, President Ford asks his guest:
"Have the Portuguese set a date yet for
allowing the Timor people to make their choice?"
The entire answer is obliterated by deletion,
but let it never be said that Kissinger's State Department did not know that
Portugal was entitled, indeed mandated, to hold a free election for the
Timorese.
It is improbable that Suharto, in the excised
answer, was assuring his hosts that such an open election would be won by
candidates favoring annexation by Indonesia.
On November 9, 1979, lack Anderson's syndicated column published an
interview with ex-President Ford on East Timor along with a number of
classified U.S. intelligence documents relating to the 1975 aggression.
One of the latter papers describes how
Indonesia's generals were pressing Suharto "to authorize direct military
intervention," while another informs Ford and Kissinger that Suharto would
raise the East Timor issue at their December 1975 meeting and would,
"try and elicit a sympathetic attitude."
The relatively guileless Ford was happy to tell
Anderson that the American national interest,
"had to be on the side of Indonesia."
He may or may not have been aware that he was
thereby giving the lie to everything ever said by Kissinger on the subject.
A WET JOB IN
WASHINGTON?
As we have now seen, Kissinger has a tendency to personalize his politics.
His policies have led directly and deliberately
to the deaths of anonymous hundreds of thousands but have also involved the
targeting of certain inconvenient individuals:
-
General Schneider
-
Archbishop Makarios
-
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
And, as we have also more than once glimpsed,
Kissinger has a special relish for localized revenge.
It seems possible that these two tendencies converge in a single case: a
plan to kidnap and murder Elias P. Demetracopoulos, a distinguished
Greek journalist with an unexampled record of opposition to the dictatorship
that disfigured his homeland between 1967 and 1974.
In the course of those years, he made his home
in Washington, D.C., supporting himself as a consultant to a respected Wall
Street firm. Innumerable senators, congressmen, Hill staffers, diplomats,
and reporters have testified to the extraordinary one man campaign of
lobbying and information that he waged against the military gangsters who
had usurped power in Athens. Since that same junta enjoyed the sympathy of
powerful interests in Washington, Demetracopoulos was compelled to combat on
two fronts, and he made some influential enemies.
After the collapse of the Greek dictatorship in 1974, Demetracopoulos gained
access to the secret police files in Athens and confirmed what he had long
suspected: there had been more than one attempt made to kidnap and eliminate
him.
Files held by the KYP-the Greek equivalent of
the CIA-revealed that the then dictator, Georgios Papadopoulos, and his
deputy security chief Michael Roufougalis, several times contacted the Greek
military mission in Washington with precisely this end in view. Stamped with
the words "COSMIC: Eyes Only"-the highest Greek security classification-this
traffic involved a plethora of schemes.
They had in common a desire to see
Demetracopoulos snatched from Washington and repatriated. An assassination
in Washington might have been embarrassing; moreover, there seems to have
been a need to interrogate Demetracopoulos before dispatching him.
One proposal was to smuggle Demetracopoulos
aboard a Greek civilian airliner; another, to put him on a Greek military
plane; and still another, to get him aboard a submarine. If it were not for
the proven record of irrationality and mania among the leaders of the junta,
one might be tempted to dismiss at least the third of these plans as a
fantasy.
One sentence in particular stands out in the COSMIC cables:
WE CAN RELY ON THE COOPERATION OF THE
VARIOUS AGENCIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BUT ESTIMATE THE CONGRESSIONAL
REACTION TO BE FIERCE.
Seeking to discover what kind of "cooperation"
this might have been, Demetracopoulos in 1976 engaged an attorney - William
A. Dobrovir of the D.C. firm of Dobrovir, Oakes, Gebhardt and Scull - and
brought suit under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.
He was able to obtain many hundreds of documents
from the FBI, the CIA, and the State Department, as well as from the
Department of Justice and the Pentagon. A number of these papers indicated
that copies had been furnished to the National Security Council, then the
domain of Henry Kissinger. But requests for documentation from this source
were unavailing.
As previously noted, Kissinger had upon leaving
office made a hostage of his own papers-copying them, classifying them as
"personal," and deeding them to the Library of Congress on condition that
they be held privately. Thus Demetracopoulos was met with a stone wall when
he used the law to try and prise anything from the NSC.
In March 1977, however, the NSC finally
responded to repeated legal initiatives by releasing the skeletal "computer
indices" of the files that had been kept on Demetracopoulos.
Paging through these, his attention was not
unnaturally caught by the following:
7024513 DOCUMENT= 5 OF 5 PAGE = 1 OF 1
KEYWORDS ACKNOWLEDGING SENS MOSS BURDICK GRAVEL RE MR DEMETRACOPOULOS
DEATH IN ATHENS PRISON DATE 701718
"Well, it's not every day," said Demetracopoulos when I interviewed him,
"that you read about your own death in a state document."
His attorney was bound to agree, and he wrote a
series of letters to Kissinger asking for copies of the file to which the
indices referred.
For several years Kissinger declined to favor
Demetracopoulos's lawyer with a reply. When eventually he did respond, it
was only through his own lawyer, who wrote that efforts were made to search
the collection for copies of documents which meet the description
provided... No such copies could be found.
"Efforts were made" is, of course, a piece of obfuscation that might
describe the most perfunctory inquiry.
We are therefore left with the question: Did
Kissinger know of, or approve, or form a part of, that "cooperation of the
various agencies of the U.S. Government" on which foreign despots had been
counting for a design of kidnapping, torture, and execution?
To begin with an obvious question: Why should a figure of Kissinger's
stature either know about, or care about, the existence of a lone dissident
journalist? This question is quite easily answered: the record shows that
Kissinger knew very well who Demetracopoulos was and detested him. The two
men had actually met in Athens in 1956, when Demetracopoulos had hosted a
luncheon at the Grand Bretagne Hotel for the visiting professor.
Over the next decade Demetracopoulos had been
prominent among those warning of, and resisting, a military intervention in
Greek politics.
The CIA generally favored such an intervention
and maintained intimate connections with those who were planning it. In
November 1963 the director of the CIA, John McCone, signed an internal
message asking for "any substantive derogatory data which can be utilized to
deny [Demetracopoulos] subsequent entry to U.S."
No such derogatory information was available,
and when the coup came Demetracopoulos was able to settle in Washington,
D.C., and begin his exile campaign.
He began it auspiciously enough, by supplying his own derogatory information
about the Nixon and Agnew campaign of 1968. This campaign- already tainted
badly enough by the betrayal of the Vietnam peace negotiations-was also
receiving illegal donations from the Greek military dictatorship. The money
came from Michael Roufougalis at the KYP and was handed over, in cash, to
John Mitchell by an ultra-conservative Greek-American businessman named
Thomas Pappas.
The sum involved was $549,000, a considerable
amount by the standards of the day. Its receipt was doubly illegal: foreign
governments are prohibited from making campaign donations (as are foreigners
in general), and, given that the KYP was in receipt of CIA subsidies, there
existed the further danger that American intelligence money was being
recycled back into the American political process-in direct violation of the
ClA's own charter.
Demetracopoulos took his findings to Larry O'Brien, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, who issued a call for an inquiry into the
activities of Pappas and the warm relations existing between the Nixon-Agnew
campaign and the Athens junta.
A number of historians have since speculated as
to whether it was evidence of this "Greek connection," with its immense
potential for damage, that Nixon and Mitchell's burglars were seeking when
they entered O'Brien's Watergate office under the cover of night.
Considerable weight is lent to this view by one salient fact: when the Nixon
White House was seeking "hush money" for the burglars, it turned to Thomas
Pappas to provide it.
Elias Demetracopoulos's dangerous knowledge of this guilty secret, and his
incessant lobbying on the Hill and in the press against Nixon and
Kissinger's client regime in Athens, drew unwelcome attention.
He later sued both the FBI and the CIA-becoming
the first person ever to do so successfully-and received written admissions
from both agencies that they possessed "no derogatory information" about
him.
In the course of these suits, he also secured an
admission from then FBI director William Webster that he had been under
"rather extensive" surveillance on and between the following dates:
November 9,1967, and October 2,1969; August
25,1971, and March 14, 1973; and February 19 and October 24, 1974.
Unaware of the precise extent of this
surveillance, Demetracopoulos nonetheless more than once found himself
brushed by a heavy hand.
On September 7, 1971, he had lunch at
Washington's fashionable Jockey Club with Nixon's chief henchman, Murray
Chotiner, who told him bluntly,
"Lay off Pappas. You can be in trouble. You
can be deported. It's not smart politics. You know Tom Pappas is a
friend of the President."
The next month, on October 27, 1971,
Demetracopoulos was lunching with Robert Novak at Sans Souci and was
threatened by Pappas himself, who came over from an adjacent table to tell
him and Novak that he could make trouble for anyone who wanted him
investigated.
On the preceding July 12, Demetracopoulos had
testified before the European subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, chaired by Congressman Benjamin Rosenthal of New York, about the
influence of Pappas on U.S. foreign policy and the Athens dictatorship (and
vice versa). Before his oral testimony could be printed, a Justice
Department lawyer appeared at the subcommittee's office and demanded a copy
of the statement.
Demetracopoulos had then, on September 17,
furnished a memorandum on Pappas's activities to the same subcommittee. His
written deposition closed with the words,
"Finally, I have submitted separately to the
subcommittee items of documentary evidence which I believe will be
useful."
This statement, wrote Rowland Evans and Robert
Novak in their syndicated column, caused,
"extreme nervousness in the Nixon White
House."
Demetracopoulos then received a letter from
Louise Gore.
Ms. Gore has since become more celebrated as the
cousin of Vice President Al Gore and the proprietress of the Fairfax Hotel
in Washington, D.C., where the boy politician grew up. She was then quite
celebrated in her own right, as a Republican state senator from Maryland and
as the woman who introduced Spiro Agnew to Richard Nixon.
She was a close friend of Attorney General
Mitchell's and had been appointed as Nixon's representative to UNESCO.
Demetracopoulos lived, along with many congressmen and political types, as a
tenant of an apartment in her hotel. He had also been a friend since 1959.
On January 24, 1972, she wrote to him,
Dear Elias,
I went to Perle's [Perle Mesta's] luncheon for Martha Mitchell yesterday
and sat next to John. He is furious at you-and your testimony against
Pappas. He kept threatening to have you deported!!
At first I tried to ask him if he had any reason to think you could be
deported and he didn't have any answer-But then tried to counter by
asking me what I knew about you and why we were friends.
It really got out of hand. It was all he'd talk about during lunch and
everyone at the table was listening . . .
Among those present at the table were George Bush, then ambassador to
the United Nations, and numerous other diplomats. The attorney general's
lack of restraint and want of tact, on such an occasion, and at the very
table of legendary hostess Perle Mesta, were clearly symptomatic of a
considerable irritation, even rage.
I have related this background in order to show
that Demetracopoulos was under surveillance, that he possessed information
highly damaging to an important Nixon-Kissinger client, and that his
identity was well known to those in power, in both Washington and Athens.
Henry Tasca, the United States ambassador in
Athens at the time, was a Nixon and Kissinger crony with a very lenient
attitude toward the dictatorship. (He later testified before a closed
session of Congress that he had known of the 1968 payments by the Greek
secret police to the Nixon campaign.)
In July 1971, shortly after Demetracopoulos
testified before Congressman Rosenthal's subcommittee,
Tasca sent a four-page secret cable from
Athens. It began:
FOR SOME TIME I HAVE FELT THAT ELIAS DEMETRACOPOULOS IS HEAD OF A
WELL-ORGANIZED CONSPIRACY WHICH DESERVES SERIOUS INVESTIGATION. WE HAVE
SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE HE HAS BEEN IN COMBATING OUR PRESENT POLICY IN
GREECE. HIS AIM IS TO DAMAGE OUR RELATIONS WITH GREECE, LOOSEN OUR NATO
ALLIANCE AND WEAKEN THE U.S. SECURITY POSITION IN THE EASTERN
MEDITERRANEAN.
This was certainly taking Demetracopoulos
seriously. So were the closing paragraphs, which read,
I AM THEREFORE BRINGING THE MATTER TO YOUR
PERSONAL ATTENTION IN THE HOPE THAT A WAY WILL BE FOUND TO STEP UP AN
INVESTIGATION OF DEMETRACOPOULOS TO IDENTIFY HIS SPONSORS, HIS SOURCES
OF FUNDS, HIS INTENTIONS, HIS METHODS OF WORK AND HIS FELLOW
CONSPIRATORS....
I BRING THIS MATTER TO YOUR ATTENTION NOW, BELIEVING THAT AS AN ALIEN
RESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO SUBMIT HIM TO THE
KIND OF SEARCHING AND PROFESSIONAL FBI INVESTIGATION WHICH WOULD LIFT
SOME OF THE MYSTERY.
The cable was addressed, as is usual from an
ambassador, to Secretary of State William Rogers. Yet it was also
addressed-highly unusually-to Attorney General John Mitchell. Mitchell, as
we have seen, was the only attorney general ever to serve on Henry
Kissinger's supervisory 40 Committee.
The State Department duly urged that,
"the Department of Justice do everything
possible to see if we can make a Foreign Agents case, or any kind of a
case for that matter" against Demetracopoulos.
Of course, as was later admitted, these
investigations turned up nothing, as Demetracopoulos's influence did not
derive from any sinister source or nexus.
But when he said that the Greek dictatorship had
trampled its own society, used censorship and torture, threatened Cyprus,
and bought itself political influence in Washington, he was uttering potent
truths. Nixon himself confirmed the connection between the junta and Pappas
and Tasca on a post-Watergate White House tape dated May 23, 1973.
He is talking to his renowned confidential
secretary, Rose Mary Woods:
Good old Tom Pappas, as you probably know or
heard, if you haven't already heard, it is true, helped, at Mitchell's
request, fundraising for some of the defendants... He came up to see me
on March 7th, Pappas did. Pappas came to see me about the ambassador to
Greece, that he wanted to-he wanted to keep [Henry] Tasca there.
This same dictatorship had in June 1970 revoked Demetracopoulos's Greek
citizenship, so he was a stateless person travelling only on a flimsy
document giving him leave to re-enter the United States. This fact
assumed its own importance in December 1970, when his blind father was
dying of pneumonia, alone, in Athens.
Demetracopoulos sought permission to return
home under a safe conduct, or laissez-passer, and was able to enlist
numerous congressional friends in the attempt. Among those who signed a
letter, dated December 11, to the Greek government and to Ambassador
Tasca were Senators Frank E. Moss of Utah, Quentin N. Burdick of North
Dakota, and Mike Gravel of Alaska. Senators Kennedy and Fulbright also
expressed a personal interest.
Neither the Athens regime nor Tasca replied directly, but on December
20, four days after the old man had died without seeing his only son,
Senators Moss, Burdick, and Gravel received a telegram from the Greek
Embassy in Washington.
This instructed them that Demetracopoulos
should have applied in person to the embassy- an odd demand to make of a
man whose passport and citizenship had just been canceled by the
dictatorship. Meanwhile, Demetracopoulos received a telephone call at
his home, from Senator Kennedy, advising him not to accept any
safe-conduct offer from Greece even if he was offered it.
Had Demetracopoulos presented himself at the
junta's embassy, he might well have been detained and kidnapped, in
accordance with one of the plans we now know had been readied for his
"disappearance."
Of course, such a scheme would have been
extremely difficult to carry out in the absence of some "cooperation"
from local American intelligence officials.
Declassified cable traffic between Ambassador
Tasca in Athens and Kissinger's deputy, Joseph Sisco, at the State
Department shows that Senator Kennedy's misgivings were amply justified.
In a cable dated December 14, 1970, from Sisco
to Tasca, the ambassador was told,
IF GOG [Government of Greece] PERMITS
DEMETRACOPOULOS TO ENTER, QUITE CLEARLY WE MUST AVOID BEING PUT IN A
POSITION OF GUARANTEEING ANY ASSURANCES THAT HE MAY HAVE OF BEING ABLE
TO DEPART.
Concurring with this extraordinary statement,
Tasca added that there was a possibility of Senator Gravel attending the
funeral of Demetracopoulos Sr. Elias, wrote the ambassador,
UNDOUBTEDLY HOPES TO EXPLOIT SENATOR'S VISIT
BY PROVIDING SOME WAY OF PROVING THAT CONDITIONS HERE ARE AS REPRESSIVE
AS HE HAS BEEN REPRESENTING THEM TO BE. HE COULD EVEN TRY TO ARRANGE FOR
SOME MANIFESTATION OF VIOLENCE, SUCH AS A SMALL BOMB.
The absurdity of this-Demetracopoulos has no
record whatsoever of the advocacy or practice of violence-also has its
sinister side.
Suggested here is just the sort of pretext that
the junta might need for a frame-up, or to cover up a "disappearance." The
entire correspondence reeks of the priorities of both the embassy and the
State Department, which reflect their contempt for elected U.S. senators,
their dislike of dissent, and their need to gratify a group of Greek
gangsters who are now rightly serving terms of life imprisonment.
Now look again at the computer index disgorged, after years of litigation,
from Kissinger's NSC files. It bears the date of December 18, 1970, and
appears to apprise Senators Moss, Burdick, and Gravel that Demetracopoulos
had met his end in an Athens prison. Was this a contingency plan? A cover
story?
As long as Dr. Kissinger maintains his stubborn
silence, and the control over his "private" state papers, it will be
impossible to determine.
Having avoided the trap that seems to have been set for him in 1970,
Demetracopoulos kept up his fusillade of leaks and disclosures, aimed at
discrediting the Greek junta and embarrassing its American friends.
He also warned of the junta's designs on the
independence of Cyprus and of American indifference to, or complicity in,
that policy. In this capacity he became a source of annoyance to Henry
Kissinger. In a Memorandum for the Record on a briefing presented to
President Gerald Ford in October 1974, there are references to "derogatory
traces from our files" about Demetracopoulos, to "the derogatory blind memo"
about him, and to "the long Kissinger memo" on him.
Once again, and despite repeated requests from
lawyers, Kissinger has declined to answer any queries about the whereabouts
of these papers, or to shed any light on their contents.
His National Security Council, however, asked
the FBI to amass any information that might discredit Demetracopoulos, and
between 1972 and 1974, according to papers since declassified, the bureau
furnished Kissinger with slanderous and false material concerning, among
other things, a romance that Demetracopoulos was allegedly conducting with a
woman now dead and a supposed relationship between him and Daniel Ellsberg,
a man he has never met.
This might seem trivial, were it not for the memoirs of Constantine
Panayotakos, the ambassador of the Greek junta to Washington, D.C.
Arriving to take up his post in February 1974,
as the ambassador wrote in his later memoirs, entitled In the First Line of
Defense,
"I was informed about some... plans to
kidnap and transport Elias Demetracopoulos to Greece; plans which
reminded me of KGB methods...
On 29 May a document was transmitted to me
from Angelos Vlachos, Secretary General of the Foreign Ministry, giving
the views of the United States ambassador Henry Tasca, which he agreed
with, about the most efficient means of dealing with the conspiracies
and the whole activity of Demetracopoulos. Tasca's views are included in
a memorandum of conversation with the Foreign Minister Spyridon Tetenes
of 27 May.
Finally, another brilliant idea of the most brilliant members of the
Foreign Ministry in Athens, transmitted to me on 12 June, was for me to
seek useful advice on the extermination of Elias Demetracopoulos from
George Churchill, director of the Greek desk at the State Department,
who was one of his most vitriolic enemies. "
Ambassador Panayotakos later wrote in a detailed
letter, which is in my possession, that he had direct knowledge of a plan to
abduct Demetracopoulos from Washington.
His testimony is corroborated by an affidavit,
which I also possess, signed by Charalambos Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos
was at the time the political counselor to the Greek Embassy-the number
three position-and was bidden to lunch at the nearby Jockey Club, in late
May or early June of 1974, by Ambassador Panayotakos and the assistant
military attaché, Lieutenant Colonel Sotiris Yiounis.
At the lunch, Yiounis broached the question of
kidnapping Demetracopoulos, who was to be smuggled aboard a Greek NATO
submarine at a harbor in Virginia.
Papadopoulos, who was Greek ambassador to Pakistan at the time he swore his
affidavit, has since said that he was assured that Henry Kissinger was fully
aware of the proposed operation. By that stage, the Greek junta had only a
few weeks to live because of its crimes in Cyprus. Since the fall of the
dictatorship even more extensive evidence of the junta's assassination plans
has been uncovered, if only at the Athenian end of the plot.
But this was not a regime that ever acted
without Washington's "understanding."
Attempts to unearth more detail have also been
made in Washington. In 1975, Senators George McGovern and James Abourezk,
seconded by Congressman Don Edwards of the House Intelligence Committee,
asked Senator Frank Church to include the kidnapping plot against
Demetracopoulos in the investigative work of his famous committee on U.S.
intelligence.
As first reported by the New York Times and then
confirmed by Seymour Hersh, Kissinger intervened personally with Church,
citing grave but unspecified matters of national security, to have this
aspect of the investigation shut down.
Some of this may seem fantastic, but we do know that Kissinger was
conducting a vendetta against Demetracopoulos (as was Ambassador Henry Tasca);
we do know that Kissinger was involved in high-level collusion with the
Greek junta and had advance knowledge of the plot to assassinate Archbishop
Makarios; and we do know that he had used the American Embassy in Chile to
smuggle weapons for the contract killing of General Rene Schneider.
The cover story in that case, too, was that the
hired guns were "only" trying to kidnap him.
Thus the Demetracopoulos story, told here in full for the first time, makes
a prima facie case that Henry Kissinger was at least aware of a plan to
abduct and interrogate, and almost certainly kill, a civilian and journalist
in Washington, D.C.
In order to be cleared of the suspicion, and to
explain the mysterious reference to Demetracopoulos's death in his own
archives, Kissinger need only make those same archives at last accessible,
or else be subpoenaed to do so.
THE PROFIT MARGIN
In his furious meeting at the State Department on December 18, 1975, shortly
after his moment of complicity with the Indonesian generals over East Timor,
Kissinger makes the following peculiar disavowal:
"I don't care if we sell equipment to
Indonesia or not. I get nothing from it. I get no rake-off."
One might have taken it for granted that a
serving secretary of state had no direct interest in the sale of weapons to
a foreign dictatorship; nobody at the meeting had suggested any such thing.
How peculiar that Kissinger should deny an
allegation that had not been made, answer a question that had not been
asked.
It isn't possible to state with certainty when Kissinger began to profit
personally from his association with the ruling circles in Indonesia, nor
can it be definitely asserted that this profit was part of any
"understanding" that originated in 1975. And yet there is a perfect
congruence between Kissinger's foreign-policy counsel and his own business
connections. One might call it a "harmony" of interests rather than a
"conflict."
Six years after he left office, Kissinger set up a private consulting firm
named Kissinger Associates, which exists to smooth and facilitate contact
between multinational corporations and foreign governments.
The client list is secret, and contracts with
the "Associates" contain a clause prohibiting any mention of the
arrangement, but corporate clients include or have included,
Kissinger's initial fellow "associates" were
General Brent Scowcroft and Lawrence Eagleburger, both of whom
had worked closely with him in the foreign-policy and national-security
branches of government.
Numerous instances of a harmony between this firm and Kissinger's policy
pronouncements can be cited. The best-known is probably that of the People's
Republic of China.
Kissinger helped several American conglomerates,
notably H.J. Heinz, to gain access to the Chinese market.
As it was glowingly phrased by Anthony J.F.
O'Reilly, CEO of Heinz,
"Kissinger and his associates make a real
contribution, and we think they are particularly helpful in countries
with more centrally planned economies, where the principal players and
the dynamics among the principal players are of critical importance.
This is particularly true in China, where he is a popular figure and is
viewed with particular respect.
On China, basically, we were well on our way to establishing the
baby-food presence there before Henry got involved. But once we decided
to move, he had practical points to offer, such as on the relationship
between Taiwan and Peking. He was helpful in seeing that we did not take
steps that would not have been helpful in Peking.
His relevance obviously varies from market
to market, but he's probably at his best in helping with contacts in
that shadowy world where that counts."
The Chinese term for this zone of shadowy
transactions is guanxi.
In less judgmental American speech it would
probably translate as "access." Selling baby food in China may seem
innocuous enough, but when the Chinese regime turned its guns and tanks on
its own children in Tiananmen Square in 1989, it had no more staunch
defender than Henry Kissinger.
Arguing very strongly against sanctions, he
wrote that,
"China remains too important for America's
national security to risk the relationship on the emotions of the
moment."
Taking the Deng Xiaoping view of the democratic
turbulence, he added that,
"no government in the world would have
tolerated having the main square of its capital occupied for eight weeks
by tens of thousands of demonstrators."
It is perhaps just as well that Kissinger's
services were not retained by the Stalinist regimes of Romania,
Czechoslovakia, and East Germany, which succumbed to just such public
insolence later in the same year.
Nor was Kissinger's influence peddling confined to Heinz's nutritious
products. He assisted Atlantic Richfield/Arco in the marketing of oil
deposits discovered in China.
He helped ITT (a corporation that had once
helped him to overthrow the elected government of Chile) to hold a
path-breaking board meeting in Beijing, and he performed similar services
for David Rockefeller and the Chase Manhattan Bank, which held an
international advisory committee meeting in the Chinese capital and met with
Deng himself.
Six months before the massacre in Tiananmen Square, Kissinger set up a
limited investment partnership named China Ventures, of which he personally
was chairman, CEO, and general partner.
Its brochure helpfully explained that CV
involved itself only with projects that,
"enjoy the unquestioned support of the
People's Republic of China."
The move proved premature; the climate for
investment on the Chinese mainland soured after the post-Tiananmen
repression and the limited sanctions approved by Congress.
This no doubt contributed to Kissinger's
irritation at the criticism of Deng. But while China Ventures lasted, it
drew large commitments from American Express, Coca-Cola, Heinz, and a large
mining-and-extraction conglomerate named Freeport-McMoRan.
Many of Kissinger's most extreme acts and positions have been taken, at
least ostensibly, in the name of anti-Communism. So it is amusing to find
him exerting himself on behalf of a regime that can guarantee safe
investment by virtue of a one-party ideology, a ban on trade unions, and a
slave-labor prison system. Nor is China the sole example here.
When Lawrence Eagleburger left the State
Department in 1984, having been ambassador to Yugoslavia, he became
simultaneously a partner of Kissinger Associates; a director of LBS Bank, a
subsidiary of a bank then owned by the Belgrade regime; and the American
representative of the "Yugo" mini-car.
Yugo duly became a client of Kissinger
Associates, as did a Yugoslav construction concern named Enerjoprojeckt.
The Yugo is of particular interest because it
was produced by the large state-run conglomerate that also functioned as
Yugoslavia's military-industrial and arms-manufacturing complex.
This complex was later seized by Slobodan
Milosevic, along with the other sinews of what had been the Yugoslav
National Army, and used to prosecute wars of aggression against four
neighboring republics. At all times during this protracted crisis, and
somewhat out of step with many of his usually hawkish colleagues, Henry
Kissinger urged a consistent policy of conciliation with the Milosevic
regime. (Mr. Eagleburger in due course rejoined the State Department as
deputy secretary and briefly became secretary of state. So it goes. )
Much the same can be said for the dual involvement of the "Associates" with
Saddam Hussein.
When Saddam was riding high in the late 1980s,
and having his way with the departments of Commerce and Agriculture, and
throwing money around like the proverbial drunken sailor, and using poison
gas and chemical weapons on his Kurdish population without a murmur from
Washington, the U.S.-Iraq Business Forum provided a veritable fruit machine
of contacts, contracts, and opportunities.
Kissinger's partner Alan Stoga, who had
also been the economist attached to his Reagan-era Commission on Central
America, featured noticeably on a junket to Baghdad. At the same time,
Kissinger's firm represented the shady Italian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro,
which was later shown to have made illegal loans to Saddam's Baathist
regime.
In the same year-1989-Kissinger made his lucrative connection with
Freeport-McMoRan, a globalized firm based in New Orleans. Its business is
the old-fashioned one of extracting oil, gas, and minerals. Its chairman,
James Moffett, has probably earned the favorite titles bestowed by the
business and financial pages, being beyond any doubt "flamboyant,"
"buccaneering," and a "venture capitalist."
In 1989, Freeport paid Kissinger Associates a
retainer of $200,000 and fees of $600,000, not to mention a promise of a 2
percent commission on future capital investments made with the Associates'
advice.
Freeport also made Kissinger a member of its
board of directors at an annual salary of at least $30,000. In 1990 the two
concerns went into business in Burma, the most grimly repressive state in
all of South Asia. Freeport would drill for oil and gas, according to the
agreement, and Kissinger's other client Daewoo would build the plant.
That year, however, the Burmese generals, under
their wonderful collective title of SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration
Council), lost a popular election to the democratic opposition, led by Aung
San Suu Kyi, and decided to annul the result. This development-yet more
irritating calls for the isolation of the Burmese junta-was unfavorable to
the Kissinger Freeport-Daewoo triad, and the proposal lapsed.
But the next year, in March 1991, Kissinger was back in Indonesia with Mr.
Moffett, closing a deal for a thirty-year license to continue exploiting a
gigantic gold-and-copper mine.
The mine is of prime importance for three
reasons.
-
First, it was operated as part of a
joint venture with the Indonesian military government and with that
government's maximum leader.
-
Second, it is located on the island of
Irian Jaya (in an area formerly known as West Irian), a part of the
archipelago that, like East Timor, is only Indonesian by right of
arbitrary conquest.
-
Third, its operations commenced in
1973-two years before Henry Kissinger visited Indonesia and helped
unleash the Indonesian bloodbath in East Timor while unlocking a
flow of weaponry to his future business partners.
This could mean no more than the "harmony of
interest" I suggested above. No more, in other words, than a happy
coincidence.
What is not coincidental is the following:
-
Freeport's enormous Grasberg mine in
Irian Jaya stands accused of creating an environmental and social
catastrophe. In October 1995 the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC), a federal body that exists to help American
companies overseas, decided to cancel Freeport's investment
insurance because of political risk, the very element on which
Kissinger had furnished soothing assurances in 1991. OPIC concluded
that Freeport's mine had "created and continues to pose unreasonable
or major environmental, health or safety hazards with respect to the
rivers that are being impacted by the tailings, the surrounding
terrestrial ecosystem, and the local inhabitants."
-
The "local inhabitants" who came last on
that list are the Amungme people, whose protests at the
environmental rape, and at working conditions in the mine, were met
by Indonesian regular soldiers at the service of Freeport-McMoRan
and under the orders of Suharto. In March 1996 large-scale rioting
nearly closed the mine at a cost of four deaths and many injuries.
Freeport-McMoRan mounted an intense lobbying
campaign in Washington, with Kissinger's help, to get its OPIC insurance
reinstated.
The price was the creation of a trust fund of
$100 million for the repair of the Grasberg site after it, and its
surrounding ecology, has eventually been picked clean. All of this became
moot with the overthrow of the Suharto dictatorship, the detention of
Suharto himself, and the unmasking of an enormous nexus of "crony
capitalism" involving him, his family, his military colleagues, and certain
favored multinational corporations.
This political revolution also restored, at incalculable human cost, the
independence of East Timor. There was even a suggestion of a war crimes
inquiry and a human-rights tribunal to settle some part of the account for
the years of genocide and occupation. Once again, Henry Kissinger has had to
scan the news with anxiety and wonder whether even worse revelations are in
store for him.
It will be a national and international disgrace
if the answer to this question is left to the pillaged and misgoverned
people of Indonesia, rather than devolving onto an American Congress that
has for so long shirked its proper responsibility.
The subject awaits its magistrate.
A NOTE ON THE LAW
As Henry Kissinger now understands, there are increasingly noticeable rents
and tears in the cloak of immunity that has shrouded him until now. Recent
evolutions in national and international law have made his position an
exposed and, indeed, a vulnerable one.
For convenience, the distinct areas of law may
be grouped under four main headings:
-
International Human Rights Law
This comprises the grand and sonorous
covenants on the rights of the individual in relation to the state;
it also protects the individual from other actors in the
international community who might violate those rights. Following
from the French Revolution's "Declaration of the Rights of Man,"
international human-rights law holds that political associations are
legitimate only insofar as they preserve the dignity and well-being
of individuals, a view that challenges the realpolitik privilege
given to the "national interest." The United States is directly
associated with sponsoring many of these covenants and has ratified
several others.
-
The Law of Armed Conflict
Somewhat protean and uneven, this
represents the gradual emergence of a legal consensus on what is,
and what is not, permissible during a state of war. It also
comprises the various humanitarian agreements that determine the
customary "law of war" and that attempt to reduce the oxymoronic
element in this ancient debate.
-
International Criminal Law
This concerns any individual, including
an agent of any state, who commits direct arid grave atrocities
against either his "own" citizens or those of another state; covered
here are genocide, crimes against humanity, and other crimes of war.
The Rome Statute, which also establishes an International Criminal
Court for the trial of individuals, including governmental
offenders, is the codified summa of this law as revised and updated
since the Nuremberg precedent. It commands the signatures of most
governments as well as, since December 31, 2000, that of the United
States.
-
Domestic Law and the Law of Civil
Remedies
Most governments have similar laws that
govern crimes such as murder, kidnapping, and larceny, and many of
them treat any offender from any country as the same. These laws in
many cases permit a citizen of any country to seek redress in the
courts of the offender's "host" country or country of citizenship.
In United States law, one particularly relevant statute is the Alien
Tort Claims Act.
The United States is the most generous in
granting immunity to itself and partial immunity to its servants, and the
most laggard in adhering to international treaties (ratifying the Genocide
Convention only in 1988 and signing the Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights only in 1992).
And the provisions of the Rome Statute, which
would expose Kissinger to dire punishment if they had been law from as early
as 1968 are not retroactive. The Nuremberg principles, however, were in that
year announced by an international convention to have no statute of
limitations.
International customary law would allow any
signatory country (again exempting the United States) to bring suit against
Kissinger for crimes against humanity in Indochina.
More importantly, United States federal courts have been found able to
exercise jurisdiction over crimes such as assassination, kidnapping, and
terrorism, even when these are supposedly protected by the doctrine of state
or sovereign immunity. Of a number of landmark cases, the most salient one
is the finding of the D.C. Circuit Court in 1980, concerning the car-bomb
murder, by Pinochet's agents, of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt.
The court held that,
"[w]hatever policy options may exist for a
foreign country," the Pinochet regime "has no 'discretion' to perpetrate
conduct designed to result in the assassination of an individual or
individuals, action that is clearly contrary to the precepts of humanity
as recognized in both national and international law."
Reciprocally speaking, this would apply to an
American official seeking to assassinate a Chilean.
Assassination was illegal both as a private and
a public act when Henry Kissinger was in power and when the attacks on
General Schneider of Chile and President Makarios of Cyprus took place.
As the Hinchey report to Congress in 2000 now demonstrates that U.S.
government agents were knowingly party to acts of torture, murder, and
"disappearance" by Pinochet's death squads, Chilean citizens will be able to
bring suit in America under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which grants U.S.
federal courts "subject-matter jurisdiction" over a claim when a non-U.S.
citizen sues for a civil wrong committed in violation of a U.S. treaty or
other international law.
Chilean relatives of the "disappeared" and of
General Schneider have recently expressed an intention to do so, and I am
advised by several international lawyers that Henry Kissinger would indeed
be liable under such proceedings.
The Alien Tort Claims Act would also permit victims in other countries, such
as Bangladesh or Cambodia, to seek damages from Kissinger, on the model of
the recent lawsuit filed in New York against Li Peng, among the Chinese
Communist officials most accountable for the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen
Square.
A significant body of legal theory can be brought to bear on the application
of "customary law" to the bombardment of civilians in Indochina. The
Genocide Convention was not ratified by the United States until 1988.
In 1951, however, it was declared by the
International Court of Justice to be customary international law.
The work of the International Law Commission is
in full agreement with this view. There would be argument over whether the
numberless victims were a "protected group" under existing law, and also as
to whether their treatment was sufficiently indiscriminate, but such
argument would place heavy burdens on the defense as well as the
prosecution.
An important recent development is the enforcement by third countries-most
notably Spain-of the international laws that bind all states.
Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish judge who
initiated the successful prosecution of General Pinochet, has also secured
the detention in Mexico of the Argentine torturer Ricardo Miguel Cavallo,
who is now held in prison awaiting extradition.
The parliament of Belgium has recently empowered
Belgian courts to exercise jurisdiction over war crimes and breaches of the
Geneva Convention committed anywhere in the world by a citizen of any
country. This practice, which is on the increase, has at minimum the effect
of limiting the ability of certain people to travel or to avoid extradition.
The Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, and
Germany have all recently employed the Geneva Conventions to prosecute war
criminals for actions committed against non-nationals by non-nationals. The
British House of Lords decision in the matter of Pinochet has also
decisively negated the defense of "sovereign immunity" for acts committed by
a government or by those following a government's orders.
This has led in turn to Pinochet's prosecution
in his own country.
There remains the question of American law. Kissinger himself admits that he
knowingly broke the law in continuing to supply American weapons to
Indonesia, which used them to violate the neutrality of a neighboring
territory and to perpetrate gross crimes against humanity.
Kissinger also faces legal trouble over his part
in the ethnic cleansing of the British colonial island of Diego Garcia in
the early 1970s, when indigenous inhabitants were displaced to make room for
a United States military base.
Lawyers for the Chagos Islanders have already
won a judgment in the British courts on this matter, which now moves to a
hearing in the United States.
The torts cited are "forced relocation, torture,
and genocide."
In this altered climate, the United States faces an interesting dilemma. At
any moment, one of its most famous citizens may be found liable for
terrorist actions under the Alien Tort Claims Act, or may be subject to an
international request for extradition, or may be arrested if he travels to a
foreign country, or may be cited for crimes against humanity by a court in
an allied nation.
The non-adherence by the United States to
certain treaties and its reluctance to extradite make it improbable that
American authorities would cooperate with such actions, though this would
gravely undermine the righteousness with which Washington addresses other
nations on the subject of human rights. There is also the option of bringing
Kissinger to justice in an American court with an American prosecutor.
Again the contingency seems a fantastically
remote one, but, again, the failure to do so would expose the country to a
much more obvious charge of double standards than would have been apparent
even two years ago.
The burden therefore rests with the American legal community and with the
American human-rights lobbies and non-governmental organizations.
They can either persist in averting their gaze
from the egregious impunity enjoyed by a notorious war criminal and
lawbreaker or they can become seized by the exalted standards to which they
continually hold everyone else.
The current state of suspended animation,
however, cannot last.
If the courts and lawyers of this country will
not do their duty, we shall watch as the victims and survivors of this man
pursue justice and vindication in their own dignified and painstaking way,
and at their own expense, and we shall be put to shame.
