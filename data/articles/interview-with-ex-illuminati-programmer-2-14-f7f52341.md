# Interview with Ex Illuminati Programmer 2 - 14

Q: Ive received some Neo-Nazi-white power-invitations through
e-mail. Ive read some of the stuff and (to put it short) they argue
with considerable elegance - backed up with historical "facts"- that
the Illuminati, of course, is a Jewish Conspiracy, and that
Hitler
was "on to them", and we all know what happened next. My simple
question: Is the Illuminati a JEWISH conspiracy?
A: My answer: absolutely not. In fact,
Hitler and his people
(especially Himmler and Goebbels) were top Illuminists. The
Illuminati are racist in the extreme, and as a child, I was forced
to play "concentration camp" both on my farm in Virginia, and also
in Europe in isolated camps in Germany.
The Jews historically fought against the occult. See
Deuteronomy and
the Old Testament for how God through the Jewish people tried to
cleanse the land of the occult groups that were operating there,
such as those who worshipped Baal, Ashtarte, and other
Canaanite and
Babylonian gods.
Since the Illuminati
trace their roots to these ancient fertility
deities, they also have an in-ground antithesis to the Jewish race.
Also, I would never trust literature sent to me by Neo-Nazi or any
extremist hate groups, since they are founded on the tenets of
racism, egalitarianism, the concept of a master race, and other
things that are also espoused strongly by the Illuminati and many
other occult groups. Simply put, this group was lying to you, and
counting on your not knowing that Nazism was founded by German
Illuminists.
Q: The dream of someone wanting to rule the world is nothing
new, obviously. History is littered with failed attempts to conquer
the world and subjugate the population. How old is the dream for the
NEW WORLD ORDER per se, by the Illuminati?
A: The Illuminati themselves teach that they have been around
for centuries and centuries, even during Roman times, and that
Alexander the Great was one of their "prototypes" in the ancient
world, as was Hitler in modern times. But the Illuminati
as we know
it today was formed in the 17th century (out of Catholic roots, ie.
the Knights Templar and Roscicrucianism).
The idea of a modern One
World Order became popular in the 1700s with the ideas of Weishaupt and others, and they have been working towards this goal
since the mid 18th century.
Q: Did the Illuminati
manipulate societies throughout history, such
a the Egyptian, Roman, British empire, etc. How far back does the
history of the Illuminati stretch and were they always known as
the
Illuminati, or did they at times operate under different covers with
the same goals?
A: The Illuminati SAY they date back to ancient Babylon on the
Fields of Shinar around 3,900 B.C, give or take. But this is
probably cult programming and boasting. They state that they are
founded on the occult base of all ancient mystery religions and
occult practices. But they actually seem to be descended from the
Knights Templar during the medieval ages, and the
Rosicrucians who
were also founded back then. I myself have trouble knowing how much
of the "cult history" I was taught as a child by my scholarship
teachers was merely programming, and how much is accurate truth, so
I cannot really be an objective source of information. Like any
group, they tend to want to "idealize" their roots.
Q: Being as intelligent as they are,
the Illuminati must know that
empires and societies throughout history only lasted about 200
years, on average. Is this a natural life cycle, or was that
duration and final downfall of empires coordinated? In other words,
was the Illuminati responsible for failed empires? Did they
purposely destroy societies and create new ones with the intention
of securing a tighter grip on future governments?
A: During historical set ups that I saw as a child, used to
teach the history of the group, supposedly behind the throne of all
ancient and modern monarchies were Illuminist advisors and
financing. They CLAIM to have manipulated history for the past 2,000
years. But I also believe that people have free choice, and that no
one person or group can truly take into account the unpredictable:
human nature and how they will respond.
I dont really believe they did all that they have claimed to. At
the same time, in the last 200 years, they have certainly had a
profound influence at the international and governmental level,
based on what I saw and heard when in the group.
Q: Svali, you said Illuminists are working hard for those goals and
looking forward to the final implementation of the glorious New
Order, or world government, so that they can take part and be
leaders in that society. At what point will the Illuminati be
satisfied with their achievements, and what is their vision of that
glorious New Order? What shape, form or system will it have, what
political infrastructure? Dictatorial, communist, democratic? Will
there be an end to their struggle for global control?
A: I was taught that during the
coming "Order" or Government,
that it would at first be a heavily dictatorial and military
government. This is why there is extensive training of covert
military forces in all ranks, to implement this policy. Why? Because
not everyone will welcome their enlightened rule, and there will
be those who oppose them.
Their army is being trained in crowd control techniques and camps
will be set up to send dissenters to. Think of Hitlers Germany,
which was a prototype. The government will be highly authoritative
and centralized in the Supreme World Council, with the national
councils and regional councils under its control.
The implementation of a
semi-Marxist, or military socialism, will
then follow (Marx was an Illuminist, and was told what to write in
his treatises), coordinated under the umbrella of the regional and
national councils. Financial power will be held at the national and
international levels. People will be asked to work at reduced wages
for the glory of serving the New Order, although compensation will
be based on loyalty and performance as time goes on (much as in
Marxist and Leninistic Russia).
Once the dissenters are subjugated and controlled, they believe that
there will no longer be a need to try for world control. They will
have it. They will then begin breeding programs to ensure that only
the best and brightest reproduce; sterilization of those considered
poor genetic specimens will begin. They are firm believers in
selective breeding, just as Hitler and his scientists were. It
is sad, but true, that this is what they teach. Children will be
tested for their psychic ability and will go through special
teaching to increase their abilities, much as they do now covertly,
only it will be open.
Q: Does the Illuminati have natural enemies or predators, or
competitors with the same goals of global control?
A: Not that I know of. They are very aware of the
Knights
Templar, and OTO [Ordo Templi Orientis, a
Catholic secret society
that is a sister group to the Templar Knights and is involved in
lots of occult and illegal activities as well], and while the two
groups are split in some areas, they are very sympathetic and share
resources with each other. The only true enemy that they see is the
Christian church, which opposes all that they do. Because
the
Illuminati are based in occult spirituality, they despise any group
that espouses Judaism or fundamental Christianity as being their
mortal enemies. This is because Christians engage in spiritual
warfare that hurts their cause.
Q: Whats your view on the role of
China and Russia in light of the
latest developments, the Russia-Sino political alignment against the
U.S., given the insight you had when you were still part of the
Illuminati?
A: Russia will be the military base and powerhouse of the group,
since their military commanders (Illuminist) are considered the best
in the world, and very, very disciplined. China, because of its
roots in oriental occultism, and its large population, will also be
considered a higher power than the US. But again, the real power
will reside in Europe, according to what I was taught when part of
the group.
China will administer the Eastern region and
Russia the North.
Again, I am sharing what I was taught, but please be aware that it
may have been programming. One of the most difficult tasks I
have encountered since getting out has been to evaluate how much of
what I was told is truth, and how much idealism and cult
programming. I am NOT an authority on this group, and I held a very
low position in it when I was part of it. I sat the leadership
council on the San Diego metropolitan area for several years, but
had little to do with the international arena.
