We will bankrupt ourselves in the vain search for absolute security.
-Dwight D. Eisenhower
How far can you go without destroying from within what you are trying
to defend from without?
-Dwight D. Eisenhower
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of deaths construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds, oh lord yeah!
Black Sabbath - War Pigs
As Americans mindlessly celebrate another Memorial Day with cookouts, beer
and burgers, the U.S. war machine keeps churning.
As we brutally enforce our will on foreign
countries, we create more people that hate us. They dont hate us for our
freedom. They hate us because we have invaded and occupied their countries.
They hate us because we kill innocent people with predator drones. They hate
us for our hypocrisy regarding democracy and freedom.
Just when we had the opportunity to make a
sensible decision by leaving Iraq and exiting the Middle East quagmire,
Obama made the abysmal choice to casually sacrifice more troops in the
Afghan shithole. We have thrown over $1.3 trillion down Middle East rat
holes over the last 11 years with no discernible benefit to the citizens of
the United States.
George Bush and
Barack
Obama did this to prove they were true statesmen.
The Soviet Union killed over 1 million Afghans,
while driving another 5 million out of the country and retreated as a
bankrupted and defeated shell after ten years. Young Americans continue to
die, for whom and for what? Our foreign policy during the last eleven years
can be summed up in one military term, SNAFU - Situation Normal All
Fucked Up.
These endless foreign interventions under the
guise of a
War on Terror are a smoke screen for what
is really going on in this country. When a government has unsolvable
domestic problems, they try to distract the willfully ignorant masses by
proactively creating foreign conflicts based upon false pretenses.
General Douglas MacArthur understood this
danger to our liberty.
I am concerned for the security of our
great Nation; not so much because of any threat from without, but
because of the insidious forces working from within.
Economic Opportunity
Cost
You cant say civilization dont advance
in every war they kill you in a new way.
- Will Rogers
Any doubt that the Military Industrial Complex
is as strong as ever should be removed after examining Obamas 2012 Budget
which has $900 billion dedicated to our military machine.
We spent $370 billion in 2001, $620 billion in
2006, and now this liberal anti-war Democrat from Illinois is spending 45%
more than that war monger Bush who was burned in effigy by the anti-war
Democrats during Iraq War protests.
It seems both parties are war pigs.
The Soviet Union collapsed in 1989, leaving the
United States as the only remaining superpower on earth.
Since 1990, the United States has depleted the
U.S. Treasury of $11.5 trillion for spending on War. With no military on
earth capable of challenging us why would there be a need to spend this much
on the military? Over this same time frame the U.S. spent $500 billion on
science, space & technology and $70 billion on energy, a mere 6% of the
spending on invading sovereign countries.
Military expenditures benefit humanity in no
way. If these trillions had been invested by the private sector or devoted
to energy and scientific research, our economy might not be a hollowed out
shell, dependent on China for financing and oil exporting countries for
energy.
Neo-Cons argue the Arms Industry employs
millions and benefits the country. These companies employ brilliant
engineers and scientists who spend their days developing weapons that kill
people more efficiently.
If they had been employed manufacturing high
tech goods to export around the world, inventing new technologies that
didnt obliterate human beings, newer safer nuclear power plants, a more
efficient electric grid, upgrading our deteriorating infrastructure, or
finding a cure for Alzheimers, would the United States be better off today?
The National Debt in 1990 was $3.2 trillion.
Today, it is $15.7 trillion. This is a 500% increase in twenty-two years.
What benefit has $11.5 trillion of spending on
War produced for the United States or the world?
In 2001, spending on Defense was 17% of total
governmental spending. In 2012, Defense, Homeland Security, and war spending
account for 25% of government spending. In the meantime, major cities
experience blackouts due to an overloaded electrical grid, our 156,000
structurally deficient bridges crumble, one hundred year old water pipes
burst under our streets every day, and we transfer over $300 billion per
year to foreign countries for our precious oil.
The 19 terrorist hijackers who implemented their
plan with box cutters, spent less than $500,000 to pull off their 9/11 acts
of terror - not war.
The United States will directly spend at least
$3 trillion on our wars of choice in response, while turning our country
into a prison camp and stripping our citizens of their freedoms and
liberties for perceived security and safety.
You would think we must be trying to keep up with our enemies by spending
$900 billion per year on past and present military adventures. But one look
at the following chart reveals the United States is spending almost as much
as the rest of the world combined. The two countries considered potential
rivals, China and Russia, spent $200 billion combined in 2010.
This is 22% of U.S. spending. From a foreign
viewpoint, one must wonder why the U.S. is spending such vast sums on our
military. They can only conclude that it is for offensive intentions rather
than defensive. The United States soil has not been attacked by a foreign
power since December 7, 1941.
Prior to that surprise attack, a foreign power
hadnt attacked the U.S. since the War of 1812. With this stupendous level
of wasteful spending, our leaders feel compelled to interfere in the
business of sovereign states and dictate how they should govern their
nations .
When you have an enormous hammer, every country
looks like a nail.
Laughably, the neo-con hawks and Fox News
pundits declare that our military is a hollow shell and needs much greater
funding to insure our safety from attack by our many enemies.
Other countries, such as China and Russia, feel
they have no choice but to increase their expenditures on the military.
On a
percentage basis, they have more than doubled their expenditures in the last
ten years, and still are a drop in the ocean compared to American Empire
spending. The fact is that the U.S., China and Russia all have enough
nuclear weapons to obliterate the world - mutually assured destruction.
The United States could realistically protect
itself from attack with only the 18 ballistic missile nuclear submarines we
have in commission.
When did Americans lose their ability to
distinguish between intellectual and moral pygmies like George Bush, Barack
Obama and Mitt Romney versus statesmen like Dwight D. Eisenhower?
The Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive war when our
country was not threatened has proven to be financially and diplomatically
disastrous and his blueprint is being followed by our Nobel Peace Prize
President in his saber rattling with Iran.
Following this policy puts them in fine company.
Preventive war was an invention of Hitler.
Frankly, I would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and
talked about such a thing.
-Dwight D. Eisenhower
The U.S. borrowed $807 billion from China, Japan
and oil exporting countries to wage a war in Iraq that was based on false
pretenses.
None of the terrorist hijackers on 9/11 were
Iraqis, they had no links to Al Qaeda, and Iraq had no weapons of mass
destruction. Historian Barbara Tuchman description of war as the unfolding
of miscalculations was never so fitting. In 2002, Secretary of Defense
Rumsfeld estimated the costs of the war in the range of $50 to $60 billion,
a portion of which he believed would be financed by other countries.
The United States invaded Iraq to secure the 115
billion barrels of oil reserves, pure and simple.
We traded the blood of young Americans for oil
because we chose to not develop a cohesive logical energy policy in the last
30 years. Americans, not in the military, sacrificed nothing in the last 11
years of war. We bought BMW SUVs, 6,000 square foot McMansions, flat screen
HDTVs, iPads, iPhones and Rolexes while less than 1% of Americans fought and
died, with the cost passed to future unborn generations.
We are a country of chickenhawks, willing to
sacrifice the few so the ruling class can comfortably relax on their decks
sipping wine, believing Fox News propaganda about terrorists lurking behind
every bush, and filling up their Mercedes convertibles for their excursions
to the summer cottage in the Hamptons.
Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from
those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not
clothed.
- Dwight D. Eisenhower
As we spend $900 billion per year on instruments
of destruction, 49 million Americans live in poverty, with 46 million on
food stamps.
There are 3 to 4 million people homeless in any
given year. Military Veterans, who make up 13% of the population, account
for 23% of the homeless. This is another example of Federal government
politicians using young Americans to fulfill their agenda and then tossing
them away like pieces of garbage.
With the country supposedly three years
into an economic recovery, tent cities of homeless dot the landscape across
the nation.
We pour billions into killing technology while
millions of American families are forced to live in tents or sleep in their
cars.
As the world spends $1.7 trillion per year on
new methods of killing, millions die the old fashioned way.
-
13 million people per year die from
starvation in the world.
-
The FAO says that 925 million people
worldwide are undernourished.
-
For the price of one missile, a school
full of hungry children could eat lunch every day for 5 years.
-
One child dies every 5 seconds as a
result of hunger - 700 every hour - 16 000 each day - 6 million each
year - 60% of all child deaths (2002-2008 estimates)
What kind of a civilized society allocates 44%
of the taxes taken from its people to war?
Only 2.5% of your taxes go to science, energy,
and environment. Only 2.2% of your taxes go to education and jobs. You
produce the results that you would expect from your investments. A full 13%
of our population doesnt have a high school diploma (20% of African
Americans & 43% of Latinos) and only 30% have a college degree.
How do we expect to lead the world in technology
and research with these figures?
We do lead the world in government issued
student loan debt with $1 trillion and rising.
Human Cost
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!
Black Sabbath - War Pigs
George Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Barack Obama are
cowardly politicians who never had the pleasure of coming under fire
in battle.
The brilliant anti-war novel
Catch-22 describes these men perfectly.
Some men are born mediocre, some men
achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With
Major Major it had been all three.
The world has been a huge game of Risk for these
warmongers, with young Americans as the game pieces.
Instead of conquering Kamchatka in a board game,
these non-veterans sent 6,470 Americans to their deaths in Iraq and
Afghanistan for a false cause.
Their ideology of empire convinced them they
could change the world into their image of how it should be, and their
re-election campaigns were funded with millions from the purveyors of death
- the arms industry.
In modern war
you will die like a dog for
no good reason.
- Ernest Hemingway
Another 47,545 Americans have been badly wounded
in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Three of these despicable politicians have
written their memoirs, raking in millions for telling lies and half-truths.
The 6,470 dead Americans wont have a chance to write their memoirs or get
rich. They will never get a chance to see their kids graduate college or
walk their daughter down the aisle at her wedding. Their children will grow
up with a giant hole in their hearts.
Their widows will never recover from
their endless heartache.
Politician chicken-hawks who send our young people to their deaths for oil
and ideology will receive their reward on judgment day if there is a just
God.
As National Guard troops have been deployed over and over again to Iraq and
Afghanistan, they must realize that Catch-22 is alive and well in todays
military.
There was only one catch and that was
Catch-22, which specified that a concern for ones own safety in the
face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a
rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded.
All he had to do was
ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have
to fly more missions.
Or would be crazy to fly more missions and
sane if he didnt, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew
them he was crazy and didnt have to; but if he didnt want to he was
sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute
simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.
Thats some catch, that catch-22, he observed.
Its the best there is, Doc Daneeka agreed
American soldiers, who have completed their duty
to country, have been lied to and had the rules of the game changed again
and again.
Their politician leaders have reneged on their
promises by sending men and women back to the war zone or not letting them
come home on the timeline that was agreed to. Meanwhile, their families have
gone bankrupt, lost their houses, and saw their marriages dissolve.
Politicians started these wars and are too
cowardly and prideful to accept failure.
The military dont start wars. Politicians
start wars.
- General William Westmoreland
Over 1,300 more Americans died needlessly when
Barack Obama, winner of the
'Nobel Peace Prize,' chose to double down in
Afghanistan to prove he was as tough as Bush and McCain.
Another man who has never been under fire needed
to prove his manliness to his opponents and his constituency.
He should have
studied the words of former Presidents who were under fire.
I hate war as only a soldier who has lived
it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its
stupidity.
- Dwight D. Eisenhower
My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the
earth.
- George Washington
President Obama follows the standard
Presidential game plan and dutifully gives patriotic speeches at military
bases proclaiming the bravery and sacrifice of our troops.
These are the words of politicians. The brutal
reality for troops is much different.
Representative Ron Paul in November
2003 described the early mistreatment of our soldiers:
-
Fort Stewart, Georgia housed hundreds of
injured reserve and National Guard soldiers in deplorable conditions
who were forced to wait months just to see a doctor. These soldiers
made huge sacrifices, leaving their families and jobs to fight in
Iraq. They found themselves living in hot, crowded, unsanitary
barracks and waiting far too long to see overworked doctors. This
was hardly the heroes welcome they might have expected. Only an
exposé in a major newspaper brought attention to their plight,
prompting an embarrassed Defense department to rush additional
doctors to the base.
-
Some wounded soldiers convalescing at
Walter Reed hospital in Washington were forced to pay for hospital
meals from their own pockets. Other soldiers returning stateside for
a two-week liberty had to buy their own airfare home from the east
coast. Still others paid for desert boots, night vision goggles, and
other military necessities with personal funds.
-
Existing federal rules forced disabled
veterans to give up their military retirement pay in order to
receive VA disability benefits. This meant that every VA disability
dollar paid to a veteran was deducted from his retirement pay,
effectively creating a disabled veterans tax. No other group of
federal employees is subject to this unfair standard; in every other
case disability pay is viewed as distinct from standard retirement
pay.
The Humvees that soldiers were forced to drive
did not have enough protective armor.
In December 2004, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld
was giving one of his usual inspirational speeches when Army Spc.
Thomas Wilson of the 278th Regimental Combat
Team, a unit that consisted mainly of reservists from the Tennessee Army
National Guard asked him a question:
Why do we soldiers have to dig through
local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic
glass to up-armor our vehicles?
This set off what the AP described as a big
cheer from his comrades in arms.
Rumsfeld paused, asked Wilson to repeat the
question, then finally replied,
You go to war with the army you have.
Besides, he added,
You can have all the armor in the world on
a tank and it can be blown up.
Im glad Donald Rumsfeld has a clear conscience.
History will not be kind to this despicable excuse for a human being.
Rumsfeld also sent Americans into battle without protective body armor. Only
after bad publicity did the proper protection reach the troops. The blood of
dead soldiers is on Rumsfelds hands. While President Bush sacrificed by not
golfing, terribly wounded soldiers were sent to Walter Reed Hospital to
recover. Instead they entered hell on earth.
Outpatient mistreatment was reported in 2004,
but nothing was done. In 2004 and 2005, articles appeared in the Washington
Post and in Salon interviewing First Lt. Julian Goodrum about his court
martial for seeking medical care elsewhere due to poor conditions at WRAMC.
A Washington Post expose in 2007 finally
revealed the horrible mistreatment of our brave wounded soldiers.
These reporters uncovered the following
conditions:
-
WRAMCs Building 18 was described in the
article as rat- and cockroach-infested, with stained carpets, cheap
mattresses, and black mold, with no heat and water reported by some
soldiers at the facility. The unmonitored entrance created security
problems, including reports of drug dealers in front of the
facility. Injured soldiers stated they are forced to pull guard
duty to obtain a level of security.
-
The typical soldier was required to file
22 documents with eight different commands - most of them off-post -
to enter and exit the medical processing world, according to
government investigators. Sixteen different information systems were
used to process the forms, but few of them could communicate with
one another. This complicated system has required some soldiers to
prove they were in the Iraq War or the War in Afghanistan in order
to obtain medical treatment and benefits because Walter Reed
employees were unable to locate their records.
There was a tremendous surge in suicides by
soldiers who have been pushed beyond their limits as they increased by 80%
between 2004 and 2008.
There are almost as many deaths by suicide as
deaths in combat:
-
Overall, the services reported 434
suicides by personnel on active duty, significantly more than the
381 suicides by active-duty personnel reported in 2009. The 2010
total is below the 462 deaths in combat, excluding accidents and
illness. In 2009, active-duty suicides exceeded deaths in battle.
-
Soldiers returning from long tours in
Iraq or Afghanistan suffering from combat stress were sometimes met
with scorn from their superiors and something bordering on neglect
from some medical officials. As their largely untreated problems
deteriorated, their marriages unraveled under the strain. They
turned to alcohol and drugs and in some cases saw no other way out
than suicide.
-
Healthcare officials at various
installations who are struggling to help say theyre overwhelmed by
huge numbers of troops returning from two, three or even four
deployments with acute mental problems from combat.
-
Statistics on Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans, obtained in 2011 through a Freedom of Information Act
request by a San Francisco newspaper, found that more than 2,200
soldiers died within two years of leaving the service, and about
half had been undergoing treatment for post-traumatic stress or
other combat-induced mental disorders at the time.
-
For five years, beginning in 2005, a
service member died by suicide every 36 hours, according to the
report by the Center for New American Security.
Nearly 20% of military service members who have
returned from Iraq and Afghanistan - 300,000 in all - report symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression, yet only slightly more
than half have sought treatment, according to a RAND Corporation report.
Many service members said they do not seek
treatment for psychological illnesses because they fear it will harm their
careers. But even among those who do seek help for PTSD or major depression,
only about half receive treatment that researchers consider minimally
adequate for their illnesses. Recent studies expect PTSD to affect 30% of
all returning veterans.
For all the glory and accolades of dying for chicken-hawks like
Dick Cheney,
enlisted soldiers make between $17,000 and $32,000 per year. The military
evidently does not prepare them well for the outside world as their
unemployment rate is 12.1% versus the national rate of 8.2%.
The pandering Obama gives speeches and the
criminal bankers at JP Morgan have their PR maggots create TV commercials
about hiring veterans, but the numbers dont lie. A country can be measured
by how well it treats its veterans. Our leaders talk a good game, but their
actions prove they dont care about the human costs of war.
They are busy planning their next move in their
game of Risk.
Moral Cost
Now in darkness, world stops
turning
As the war machine keeps burning
No more war pigs of the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
All right now!
Black Sabbath - War Pigs
Omar Bradley, the last five star General in the U.S. military, was
known as the soldiers general during World War II.
He was portrayed by Karl Malden in the movie
Patton as a thoughtful man who cared about his troops. He was one of the key
architects of the Normandy invasion and led the 12th Army Group consisting
of 900,000 men until the end of the war. After the war, Bradley headed the
Veterans Administration for two years.
He is credited with doing much to improve its
health care system and with helping veterans receive their educational
benefits under the G.I. Bill of Rights. He ultimately rose to Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs.
Contrast the words of the fictional Colonel
Kilgore from the movie Apocalypse Now, with the words of General
Bradley:
Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the
morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it
was all over, I walked up. We didnt find one of em, not one stinkin
dink body. The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill.
Smelled like
[ sniffing, pondering ]
victory. Someday this wars gonna end
[ suddenly walks off ]
The world has achieved
brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience.
Ours is
a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.
We know more
about war than we know about peace,
more about killing than
we know about living.
- Omar Bradley
We need giants like Omar Bradley and Dwight D.
Eisenhower to lead our country through the difficult times ahead.
These men knew the horrors of war and didnt act
like it was a game of chess. Instead we will be led by intellectual and
ethical infants, Obama or Romney. There are no wise men with a conscience
and high moral standards in power today. Only those with no conscience and a
willingness to lie are able to gain power in todays world. General Bradley
understood that morality was ultimately more important than power and
strength in determining the progress of a country.
His words are those of someone who knew we had
failed in our moral duty:
We have grasped the mystery of the atom and
rejected the Sermon on the Mount.
Peacemakers are ridiculed and shunned in America
today.
Those who preach diplomacy and
non-interventionism, like Ron Paul, are scorned and ignored. Old men who
care more about their own power than the human race are willing to sacrifice
the blood of young people for precious oil, phony nationalism, their own
strategic interests or corporate interests disguised as philosophical
agendas. The world is a game for these old men. They care about their
personal legacy and rigid ideologies. War and militarism are a failure of
passion over reason.
Albert Einstein, whose discovery brought about
this age of potential world destruction, had no love for these blind
warriors.
He who joyfully marches to music in rank
and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain
by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.
The overwhelming cost of maintaining a global
empire eventually bankrupted Rome and Great Britain.
Treasures were wasted, young men were needlessly
sacrificed in the name of the flag, and the morality of leaders sank to
unprecedented levels. The U.S. had advanced financially and technologically
for more than a century, but since the takeover of our economic system by
private banking and corporate interests in 1913 we have seen continuous war,
continuous currency debasement, and continuous moral decay.
How far will we decline before a sufficient
number of Americans are outraged enough to lead a new American Revolution?
Our current situation reminds me of the movie Planet of the Apes. The apes
are divided into a strict class system: the gorillas as police, military,
and hunters; the orangutans as administrators, politicians and lawyers; and
the chimpanzees as intellectuals and scientists. Humans, who cannot talk,
are considered feral vermin and are hunted and used for scientific
experimentation. The United States is now in the control of gorillas and
orangutans.
If we continue down the current path of
financial and moral decay, allowing the Military Industrial Complex,
criminal bankers and corrupt politicians to push us into further world
conflicts, we will experience the shock and horror that George Taylor,
played by Charlton Heston, displayed in the final scene of Planet of the
Apes.
George Taylor: Oh my God. Im back. Im
home. All the time, it was
We finally really did it.
[ screaming ]
You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!
The War Pigs must be stopped before its too
late.
The Military Industrial Complex, with the
unwavering support of central bankers printing unlimited amounts of fiat
currency, while controlling the scoundrel puppets in Washington DC, will
destroy this country in their never ending quest for power and profits. One
man fights a lonely battle against these forces of oppression.
We must join his legion and take this country
back from the war pigs.
As many frustrated Americans who have
joined the Tea Party realize, we cannot stand against big government at
home while supporting it abroad. We cannot talk about fiscal
responsibility while spending trillions on occupying and bullying the
rest of the world.
We cannot talk about the budget deficit and
spiraling domestic spending without looking at the costs of maintaining
an American empire of more than 700 military bases in more than 120
foreign countries.
We cannot pat ourselves on the back for
cutting a few thousand dollars from a nature preserve or an inner-city
swimming pool at home while turning a blind eye to a Pentagon budget
that nearly equals those of the rest of the world combined.
Ron Paul
