The Bilderbergers
The Bilderbergers are an international group composed of European Royalty,
Wall Street investors, politicians, international bankers, prominent
businessmen, media executives, and military leaders from around the planet.
"Those in attendance include leading political and financial figures from
the United States and Western Europe," proclaimed Allen. Allen also says
that it is probably "not accidental," that less than one person in 5,000 is
aware of this group. Jim Marrs wrote, "The Bilderbergers are a group of
powerful men and woman-many of them European royalty - who meet in secret
each year to discuss the issues of the day."
Bilderberg HotelThe first official meeting of the Bilderbergers took place
at the Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, Holland in May 1954. It was formed
in part by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, a former Nazi. "The primary
impetus for the Bilderberger meetings came from Dutch Prince Bernhard,"
wrote author Marrs, "a former member of the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) and an
employee of Germany's I.G. Farben in Paris." The Rockefellers and
Rothschilds are said to have played an important part in its inception also.
Pictured right is the Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, Holland.(*)
Veteran journalist James P. Tucker has investigated the Bilderbergers nearly
30 years. His book, The Bilderberg Diary, which includes photographic
evidence, is a well-documented account of the results of his investigation.
In it he writes, "The Bilderberg group is an organization of political
leaders and international financers that meets secretly every spring to make
global policy. There are about 110 regulars," he says, including,
"Rockefellers, Rothschilds, bankers, heads of international corporations and
high government officials from Europe and North America." These people meet
at varying locations around the planet.
Referring to the financial elite's various fronts, Professor Marrs wrote,
"Comprising themselves in the form of the Bilderberger Group, they have met
at least annually since 1954." Their meetings are by invitation only, and
according to Gaylon Ross, of the three interlocking Think Tanks, they are
the most secretive. They are also the most influential. Their meetings are
financed by the Tax-exempt Foundations. Allen asked, "Why do the Ford,
Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations finance the meetings if they are not
important?"
In 1964, Dan Smoot acknowledged this elite group when he wrote, "The 'Bilderbergers'
are another powerful group involved in the internationalist web." Speaking
of the interlocking membership, he proclaimed, "American firms associated
with the society are said to be among the large corporations whose officers
are members of the Council on Foreign Relations and related organizations."
The Bilderbergers have close ties to Europe's nobility such as the British
royal family, as well as royalty from Holland, Sweden and Spain. They also
contain the same representatives in finance and industry as their
counterparts, The Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign
Relations. There is also a heavy cross-membership with the Trilateral
Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.
"As with the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations,
Bilderbergers often carry cross-membership in two or more of these three
groups, commented Marrs." Allen remarked, "Those who adhere to the
accidental theory of history will claim that it is sheer coincidence that
every single one of those named as past and present members of the
Bilderberger Steering Committee is or was a member of the Council on Foreign
Relations."
The Bilderbergers are said to be the organization that sets global policy
which is then passed on to the CFR and TC to implement. While the Trilateral
Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations both publish their
membership rolls, the Bilderbergers keep the meetings, goals, and membership
lists secret. "Bilderberg does not publish membership lists but they have
been obtained by investigative reporters working for The Spotlight," wrote
Ross.
SWAT Each year the hosting government is responsible for providing heavy
security for three days, which includes: the military, the secret service,
federal and local police, and private security firms. Allen explains, "The
participants are housed in one location and are protected by a thorough
security network. Decisions are reached, resolutions adopted, plans of
action initiated..." A Swedish SWAT team member confronts Tucker during the
2001 Bilderberg meeting in Gothenburg Sweden.
"When they meet, they clear out all the guests, and employees in the
building in which they are to meet," Ross said, and added "they completely
de-bug all the rooms, bring in their own cooks, waiters, housekeepers,
heavily armed security guards, etc. and do not allow 'outsiders' anywhere
near the meeting place just before, during and immediately after they meet."
Police EscortContinuing he explained, "Each time they have met on US soil,
the meetings were held on Rockefeller owned property." According to veteran
journalist Tucker, some hotel staff is allowed to stay but are given strict
orders to never to speak to a Bilderberger unless spoken to, or look them in
the eyes. The picture on the right was taken during the 2003 Bilderberg
meeting in Versailles, France, where Bilderberg attendees received police
escorts.

Bilderberg members during the 2005 meeting in Rottach-Egern, Germany. And

outside the 2001 Bilderberg meeting in Gothenburg Sweden.
The Rutland Vermont Herald apparently received notice of a Bilderberg
meeting when local officials were given instructions on how to prepare for
it. It declared on April 20, 1971, "A rather tight lid of secrecy was being
kept on the [Bilderberg] conference." "A closed-door meeting," it described,
"was held in Woodstock last week to brief a handful of local officials on
some phases of the [future] conference... The Woodstock Inn will apparently
be sealed up like Fort Knox... No press coverage will be allowed."
Referring to the same meeting which took place on April 23, 1971 in
Woodstock, Vermont, Allen wrote, "When Prince Bernhard arrived at Boston's
Logan Airport, he did admit to reporters that the subject of the conference
would be the "change in the world-role of the United States." Allen
remarked, "Isn't it nice to have changes in America's role in the world
decided upon by Bernhard, Rothschild and Rockefeller?"
The mainstream news will normally not report on these meetings. Speaking of
the media blackout Tucker said, "Bilderberg has, at one time or another, had
representatives of all major U.S. newspapers and network news outlets
attend. They do so on their promise to report nothing. This is how
Bilderberg keeps its news blackout virtually complete in the United States."
According to Tucker, as part of a disinformation strategy, mainstream
newspapers in the United States may even portray these meetings as harmless
talk-sessions of little importance.
Marrs commented, "Unlike their American counterparts, some members of
Scotland's news media found their voice. Under the headline, Whole World in
their Hands, Jim McBeth of The Scotsman described the tight security
surrounding the [1998] meeting [at the Turnberry Hotel near Glasgow,
Scotland], commenting, 'Anyone approaching the hotel who did not have a
stake in controlling the planet was turned back.'"
"The press, naturally, is not allowed to be present, although occasionally a
brief press conference is held at the end of the meeting at which time the
news media are given in very general terms the Bilderberger version of what
was discussed," observed Allen. Reporters that are not invited and attempt
to document these meetings have been arrested. Marrs added, "Despite the
fact that many highly regarded American media members meet with the
Bilderbergers, little or nothing gets reported on the group or its
activities..."
Although there is a media blackout concerning these meetings, the news media
are always present, agreed Ross. He lists past attendees, "such as: Peter
Jennings (BB, and Anchor and Senior Editor of ABC News, World News Tonight),
Joseph C. Harsch (BB, CFR, and former Commentator for NBC, Inc.), Bill D.
Moyers (BB, and Executive Director of Public Affairs TV, Inc., and former
Director of the CFR), [and] William F. Buckley, Jr. (BB, CFR, and
Editor-in-Chief of National Review, and host of PBS's Firing Line)."
Ross says other media personnel which have attended include, "Gerald Piel
(BB, CFR, and former Chairman of Scientific America, Inc.), Henry Anatole
Grunwald (BB, CFR, and former Editor-in-Chief of Time, Inc.), Mortimer B.
Zuckerman (BB, CFR, and Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of the US News and
World Report, New York Daily News, and Atlantic Monthly), Robert L. Bartley
(BB CFR, TC, and Vice President of the Wall Street Journal)."
Washington PostMore media attendees, according to Ross, are Peter Robert
Kann (BB, CFR) of Dow Jones and Company, Donald C. Cook of the Los Angeles
Times, Thomas L. Friedman of the New York Times, and Katherine Graham owner
of The Washington Post. Most of these attendees have cross memberships in
the CFR and TC. Here to the right we see Washington Post publisher Donald
Graham (center) during the 2004 meeting in Stresa, Italy.
Tucker commented that mainstream media apparently doesn't think these
meetings are newsworthy. Evidently, for decades the Post and most other
major media outlets didn't think the public would be interested in learning
about these world leaders meeting to shape world events. Is it possible that
there's something else of major significance they're not reporting or are
being used to cover-up?
On May 26, 1995 the Swiss newspaper, Tagesschau, ran a story entitled, The
Swiss Military to Protect International and Leading Economists and
Statesmen. The article explained, "Prominent leaders from the world of
politics and economics will be meeting at Nidwalden on Mt. Bergenstock,
Switzerland, for the very secretive Bilderberg conference... [A]mong the
participants are Leading Bankers, politicians and industrialists from Europe
and North America. The Luminaries from the 1995 meeting include Kurt Furgler,
Walter Scheel, Henry Kissinger, Helmut Kohl, Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli,
shipping magnate Stavos Niarchos, David Rockefeller and Prince Claus of the
Netherlands."
RockefellerThe 1994 meeting in Helsinki, Finland, Tucker wrote, included,
"In addition to Rockefeller and Kissinger, other familiar faces... [such as]
Lord Peter Carrington, Queen Beatrix of Holland, NATO chief Woerner,
President Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Esko Aho of Finland, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, German central banker Hans-Otto Pohl and Atos Erkko,
a well known Finnish publisher."
To the top left we see David Rockefeller at the 2004 Stresa Italy Bilderberg
meeting. Below it we see him again (seated right) next to Vernon Jordan.
Standing is Richard Perle (far right), and Jessica Mathews of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
Also in attendance says Tucker, were, "Franz Vranitsky, President of
Austria; Percy Barnevik, President of ABB (Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.) of
Sweden; Giovanni Agnelli, head of the giant Fiat firm in Italy; Max Jacobson
and Jaakko Illoniemi of Finland; Rozanne Ridgway, Assistant Director of the
White House Office of Management and Budget; and Volker Ruhe of Germany."
Tucker lists other attendees as, "Katherine Gram, owner of The Washington
Post Co.; Louis Gerstner of IBM; Thomas Pickering, U.S. Ambassador to
Russia; Brent Scowcroft, Adviser to Bush; Paul Allaire of Xerox; Peter
Sutherland of Britain; [and] Queen Sofia of Spain."
Referring to the meeting in Versailles, France in 2003, Tucker announced,
"The following have been positively identified as participating: Queen
Beatrix of The Netherlands; Ali Babacan, Minister of the Economy in Turkey;
King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia of Spain; Jacques Chirac, President of
France, Kenneth Clark, former British Chancellor of the Exchequer and member
of the Parliament; Etienne D'avignon, Societe General of Belgium; Jean Louis
Debre, President of the French National Assembly; Kermal Dervis, Turkey;
Sevein Gjerem, CEO of the National Bank of Norway."
Gerald Ford attended Bilderberg meetings 1964 and 1966, and in 1974 became
President. And while Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton attended a 1991
meeting before becoming President in 1992. Regarding Clinton's Bilderberg
connection, Marrs wrote, "In 1991, then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was
honored as a Bilderberg guest. The next year he ran for and won the
presidency of United States."
The plan for a common European currency, the Euro, is said to have been
formulated by the Bilderbergers. Tucker claims that the plan for a "European
super-state" and the "euro" had been on the Bilderberg agenda for years. "It
was viewed as a major step toward their goal of a world government and
creates a favorable climate for the huge banks to consume the small ones and
for the huge, international conglomerates to absorb the small firms," he
observed.
Quoting a Bilderberger, Marrs added that, "Jack Sheinkman, Chairman of
Amalgamated Bank and a Bilderberger member, stated in 1996, 'In some cases
discussions do have an impact and become policy. The idea of a common
European currency was discussed several years back before it became policy.
We had a discussion about the U.S. establishing formal relations with China
before Nixon actually did it.'"
"Bilderberg has had a direct influence on the White House since President
Dwight Eisenhower's years," wrote Tucker. "They are accustomed to owning the
president-whoever he is and whatever party is in control of the White House.
A look back: Clinton, Trilateral and Bilderberg; Bush, Trilateral; Regan,
received the Trilateralists at the White House and had his Vice President
(Bush) address their meeting; Carter [Trilateralist] and his Vice President,
Walter Mondale, both Bilderberg; Jerry Ford and his Vice President, Nelson
Rockefeller, both Bilderberg..."
Tucker further proclaimed that "Most presidents have been members of at
least one of these two groups [Bilderberg or Trilateral Commission], and all
have had representatives attend Bilderberg meetings to receive their
orders." Allen observed the same pattern; he stated, "While the 'new world
order' is being built, the Bilderbergers coordinate the efforts of the
European and American power elites." So according to this information the
leaders of the NATO nations are covertly controlled by this elite group of
financial elitists.
A single currency is said to be in the planning for the entire Western
Hemisphere by the Bilderbergers, which will eventually be followed by a
world currency. The Bilderbergers, according to Tucker, are also in the
process of implementing a global citizens' tax which will be payable to the
United Nations. He wrote, "Like the federal income tax, a UN levy would be
so small at the outset the consumer would hardly notice. But establishing
the principle that the UN can directly tax citizens of the world is
important to Bilderberg. It is another giant step toward world government.
It is openly discussed with little public notice or objection..."
The objective of the Bilderberg Group appears to be the same as its
interlocking Think Tanks, which is a one-world dictatorship, dominated by
the financial elite. Journalist Tucker asserts, "Leaders of Bilderberg and
its brother group, the Trilateral Commission... together make up the word
shadow government." Tucker informs us that what the Bilderbergers really
intend is "a global army at the disposal of the United Nations." And that
"it has been a long standing goal of Bilderberg for the UN to become the
world government to which all nations will be subservient."
Wolfowitz & DavignonTo the right we see Honorary Bilderberg Chairman Etienne
Davignon (left) with Paul Wolfowitz, former Secretary of Defense and current
head of the World Bank, at the Bilderberg meeting in Rottach-Ergen, Germany
in 2005. Professor Texe Marrs, has lectured at the University of Texas,
authored over 25 books, and has retired from the USAF as an officer with
numerous decorations. Writing with authority, backed by careful research, he
concludes, "The goal of the Bilderbergers is to create a pretense [fake]
democratic World Government, controlled by them."
Author Marrs noted that Bilderberg members that are not part of the
inner-core, may not be aware of the true intentions or objectives of the
group, and may be convinced that world government is the only way to peace.
This also appears to be the situation with its interlocking Think Tanks, the
Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.(*) "Not everyone
who attends one of the Bilderbergers' secret meetings is an Insider," agreed
Allen. "Bilderberg policy is not planned by those who attend the
conferences, but by the elite steering committee of Insiders."
"Remember, the Bilderbergers are philosophically neither Republican nor
Democrat, declared Professor Marrs. "Their only 'party' is filthy lucre...
Money, in turn, brings them power, and these folks have a never satisfied
appetite for raw power." Apparently Gorbachev was influenced by the
Bilderbergers and talked about a global union during a speaking tour in the
United States. "Gorbachev's speeches could have been dictated by Kissinger
after being drafted by Rockefeller... as content was concerned," charged
Tucker. "Gorbachev held out the Bilderberg-Trilateral vision of a UN
military force that could invade once-sovereign nations to enforce 'human
rights.'" "The New World Order means a new kind of civilization," Gorbachev
told the Chicago CFR on May 8, 1991.
Regarding how President Clinton pushed the Bilderberger objective in 1999,
Tucker wrote, "It appeared in daily newspapers for all to read, but too many
sleep. The developments were celebrated by The Washington Post's Bilderberg
representative Jimmy Lee Hoagland in a column on June 27, 1999... [When he
proclaimed], 'The president promises a future in which Americans stand ready
to intervene militarily if they can stop wholesale racial or ethnic
slaughter "within or beyond other nations' borders"... He promises a new
world order.'" The first American woman to attend a Bilderberg meeting was
Hilary Clinton in 1997. Author Marrs senses they may have plans for her in
the following years.
Summary
Presidents and prime ministers are selected by the Bilderbergers and
controlled like puppets. Bilderberg meetings are guarded by the military,
SWAT teams, local police and private security firms. Like the CFR, their
policy is passed without public approval. Their goal is to create a world
government under their control, which will have the illusion of freedom.
Their motives for establishing a global dictatorship using a fake democracy
will be expanded upon when we examine a future chapter on psychopathy. Most
are unaware of their existence due to a media blackout. Despite attending
Bilderberg meetings, mainstream media owners have reported little on this
group for over fifty years.
