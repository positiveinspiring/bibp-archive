The Obama Administration has heightened tensions with China through a series
of measures which can only be characterized as major provocations designed
to undermine relations between the two countries.
These provocations include
political support for separatist movements, such as the US-funded
theocratic-monk led Tibetan secessionists and the Washington-based Uyghur
secessionists, as well as through the $6.4 billion-dollar advanced arms
sales to Taiwan, a virtual protectorate of the US Navy.
President Obama has
publicly met with and openly backed these separatist and secessionists
groups, flaunting Washingtons refusal to recognize Chinas existing
borders.
This is part of the US strategy of encouraging the physical
break-up of independent nations, which are viewed as obstacles to its
program of
global military empire building.
In addition to continuing and escalating the hostile policies of his
predecessor, the Obama Administration has exploited several other issues in
order to rally American public opinion and mobilize overseas allies behind
its confrontational posture.
-
First, the Obama Administration claims that
Chinas currency (the Renminbi) is artificially undervalued to give Chinese
exports an unfair price advantage, thus undercutting US manufacturing
exports and costing millions of American jobs.
-
Secondly, the
Administration claims that, after the US had opened its domestic
manufacturing market to Chinese firms, the Chinese would not reciprocate
and open their financial sectors to Wall Street investment banks.
In retaliation for growing Chinese exports, Washington has raised protective
tariffs on steel pipes and automobile tires, and issued Congressional
threats of further protectionist measures.
The US has insists that other nations support its aggressive policy toward
Iran, including imposing trade, investment and financial sanctions,
supporting the provocative US naval build-up in the Persian Gulf and backing
Israels bellicose threats to bomb Teheran.
In contrast, China rejects
economic sanctions, in favor of negotiations, while increasing its trade and
investments in strategic sectors of the Iranian economy.
In
the United
Nations Security Council, the US has exerted diplomatic and mass media
pressure to force China to vote for a Zionist-authored proposal of
wide-reaching sanctions against Iran. Obama refuses to accept Chinas
rejection of the US military-driven policy of regime change and the Chinese
pursuit of free trade with Iran.
The US Administrations selective definition of self-determination
includes giving support to secessionist ethno-religious regional movements
in China, while, at the same time,
-
invading and occupying independent
states, like Iraq and Afghanistan
-
ordering missile attacks on other states,
like Pakistan and Somalia
-
establishing over 700 military bases world-wide
with extra-territorial jurisdiction
-
engaging in assassinations of its
opponents abroad via the CIA and Special Forces
In contrast, China is not at war and opposes military invasions of sovereign
states.
China does not have overseas military bases and is menaced by the US
policy of encircling Chinas frontiers with American bases in client states
in Northeast, Southeast and Central Asia.
While US military occupation forces brutally violate human rights of
millions of citizens in occupied or targeted countries, and threaten the
civil rights of critical Americans with arbitrary rulings, secret trials and
the suspension of habeas corpus, the Obama regime excoriates China for its
prosecution of opposition activists.
The Obama regime has latched onto a conflict between a private US
corporation, Google, and Chinese hackers, which it alleges are state
sponsored, turning the issue into a major struggle for internet freedom at
the level of state to state relations. Despite the expanding presence of
scores of US-owned IT companies in China, the Obama regime has raised the
issue of internet censorship to the level of a major ideological
confrontation.
Climate change is another source of aggravation between the states.
At the
Copenhagen summit in December 2009, Obama rejected any formal agreement on
the reduction of carbon emissions while deflecting criticism and blame on to
China and other developing countries, which had agreed to informal
substantive targets on CO2 reductions.
Of all these points of contention, the most serious is Washingtons
financial, diplomatic and political support for ethnic secessionist groups
in China, threatening the security and territorial integrity of the Chinese
state.
This paramount issue has re-awakened painful memories of earlier
imperialist carving up of China, its rich port cities and territories and
has forced the Chinese authorities to consider retaliatory measures.
Imperial Policies: At What Price?
The Obama regimes political and diplomatic provocations against China in
pursuit of its military-driven empire, come at a very high real and
potential price.
We cannot assume that China will remain a stoic punching
bag for the US, absorbing territorial threats, economic pressures and
gratuitous diplomatic insults without taking counter-measures especially in
the economic sphere.
Chinas Crucial Role as US Creditor
Obamas provocative militarist posturing toward China endangers major US
private and public economic interests, including Chinas financing of the
burgeoning US debt.
China is the worlds largest and fastest growing investor in US securities.
According to a detailed study by the Congressional Research Service (CRS)
(July 30, 2009), China holds a vast amount of long-term treasury debt, US
agency debt, US corporate debt, US equities and short-term debt estimated at
over $1.2 trillion.
Chinas investment in US Treasury securities were used
to help finance the economic recovery (such as it is).
If the Obama regime
persists in its provocations, China may decide to unload a large share of
its US securities holdings, inducing other foreign investors to also sell
off their holdings (CRS op cit). This would lead to a sharp depreciation of
the dollar and force Washington to raise interest rates, which could drive
the US into a deeper recession/depression.
Economists, who claim Chinese
economic interests would suffer from such a sell off, overlook the fact that
for Beijing, national sovereignty is more important than short-term economic
losses, especially in view of US support for secessionist movements.
Moreover, the Chinese have a high rates of savings, huge foreign reserves
and increasingly diverse markets and suppliers of essential commodities.
China is in a better position to absorb the shock of a decline in US
economic relations resulting from American bellicosity than the debt-ridden,
negative-saving, military-driven North American economy.
Foreign Direct Investments
Almost all of the 400 biggest US multi-national corporations, listed in
Forbes, have major profitable investments in China, which are growing. The
Obama regimes increasingly confrontational position toward China puts these
investments at risk.
US foreign investments in China far exceed the latters investments in the
US, according to a report published by the UCLA Asian American Studies
Center. In 2006, Chinas foreign direct investment (FDI) in the US was $600
million, while US investments in China were $22.2 billion.
The Report goes
on to state,
the complaints by many American businesses and politicians
that China can invest in US companies with relative ease while China still
tightly restricts access to Chinese markets and companies appear not to be
borne out by the numbers.
The US government has, in fact, blocked several
large scale investments by Chinese companies, including the multi-billion
dollar purchase of an,
Chinese investments in the US are not
always profitable.
The Sovereign Wealth Fund (a Chinese government-run
investment fund) lost over 50% of its $8 billion-dollar investment in the
finance groups, Blackstone Group and Morgan Stanley, in less than a year.
The Obama regimes complaints about Chinas restrictive treatment of US
companies fly in the face of economic reality. The attacks are part of a
political strategy of anti-Chinese propaganda to heighten the American
publics antagonism against China and rally domestic support for any
military confrontation. Even as US companies in China reap profits a
thousand times greater than Chinese investments in the US, and the leading
investment houses swindle Chinese sovereign investors of billions, the White
House claims foul play!.
Chinas much-maligned policy of restricting financial takeovers by Wall
Street firms was one of the reasons the US speculative collapse did not
impact its economy.
And still Washington continues to attack Beijing on the
issue of opening Chinese financial markets to Wall Street.
US - China Trade
The Obama regime has repeatedly raised the issue of Chinas undervalued
currency, conveniently ignoring the fact that Chinas imports from the US
are growing faster than its exports to the US.
Between 2006-2008 US annual
exports to China grew 32%, 18%, 9.5%, while its imports of Chinese goods
grew 18.2%, 11.7%, 5.1%. Moreover top US exports included electrical
machinery and equipment, power generation equipment, oil seeds and
oleaginous fruits, aero-space products, optical equipment and iron and steel
a broad spectrum of American industrial products with high value-added,
well-paying skilled employment and lucrative profits.
Moreover, the fact that US exports to China include a diverse array of
manufacturing sectors and are competitive at the current exchange rate,
suggests that the vast US trade deficit with China has less to do with
Chinas currency policy and more to do with US public and private investment
policies and the relative strengths of the productive forces of each
economy.
In large part, the majority of exports from China to the US are the
result of US multi-national corporate decisions to produce and sub-contract
in China. In other words, the trade deficit with China is directly related
to US corporate global investment strategy, which, in turn, flourished after
the US government liberalized it rules and deregulated US corporate conduct.
Liberal investment policies under the US government, and not Chinese unfair
trade rules, are a major cause of the trade deficit.
The angry posture adopted by the Obama regime toward Chinas undervalued
currency is a political ploy to deflect attention from its disastrous
liberal economic policies and its support for the investment conduct of
large US corporations.
The US annual trade deficit with China has grown almost four fold between
1999-2008, from $68.7 billion to $266.3 billion. The growth of the trade
deficit coincides with the massive shift of US investment from manufacturing
to speculative financial, real estate and insurance activities. In other
words, the US re-directed its investment strategies from producing useful,
quality commodities for domestic consumption and export to importing
manufactured goods from abroad at a greater profit for the corporations.
The
weakening of US productive capacity - its productive forces - was reflected
in its declining competitive position and its deepening trade imbalances.
Given the tight relations between the White House and Wall Street, policy
makers sought to blame Chinese monetary officials for an undervalued
currency, rather than confront the bubble economy stimulated by the policies
of the Federal Reserve and generated by the Wall Street investment houses,
whose executives go on to occupy key economic posts in the US government and
who provide substantial funding for electoral campaigns.
In those economic sectors where US investment has led to increased
efficiency, like agriculture, the US has competed successfully.
China is the
leading buyer of American soybeans and cotton accounting for over half
world sales of the former and between almost a third of the latter according
to the U.S. International Trade Commission and the US Department of
Commerce.
Trade, Credit, Investments versus Militarism and Speculation
Chinas economic relations with the US have been extraordinarily lucrative
and favorable to the big US capitalists and the American government.
By
purchasing low-interest US Treasury notes, China has financed US trade and
budget deficits, which are the result of exorbitant military spending,
multiple imperial wars and occupations, and unproductive speculative
investments. The US multi-nationals have reaped high rates of profit from
their investments in China, profits far in excess of what they would have
gained in the US, and many times more than what a few Chinese firms earn in
the more restrictive US climate.
Important US economic sectors in aerospace,
agro business, port facilities, transport and giant commercial retailers and
importers depend on and profit from trade with China. US speculators have
been able to rake in huge profits from the Chinese Sovereign Funds by
pumping and dumping speculative US stocks.
As Chinas dynamic growth and rate of consumer demand continue to race ahead
of the US, American exports to China outpace its imports from China.
The growing political antagonism and reckless diplomatic actions against
China taken by the White House and Congress serve to undermine the basic
economic interests of a broad swath of US capitalist enterprises as well as
the credibility of the US economy.
What is even more striking is that many
of the charges leveled against Beijing, including its unfair treatment of
investors and closed economy apply with greater force to Washington.
The Paradox of Economic Gain and Political Hostility
The key to understanding this paradox of economic gain and political
hostility lies in the fundamentally different political and economic
structures and global strategies of the two countries.
The US economy has
been driven by its financial and speculative capitalist classes, which in
turn wield decisive political influence over state economic policy. At the
same time, the commercial capitalist class is more attuned to importing
manufactured goods, rather than in long-term investment in research,
development in the American manufacturing sector. Neither commercial nor
financial capital has a stake in stimulating US exports and in investing in
the productive forces of the country.
The design and implementation of US
global strategy is controlled by the civilian militarists and imperial
ideologues, (especially the Zionists) in government and their counterparts
in sectors of the military high command.
In contrast to the Chinese market-driven quest for global power, US
imperialism is built around military conquest and appropriation of economic
wealth. The disproportionate influence exercised by the civilian militarists
in the US government has resulted in a series of foreign wars, which have
severely strained the US economy and led to a military definition of US
global objectives.
Faced with Chinas growing economic relations and
influence in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East and Beijings
opposition to US military-driven imperial policies against Iran, the
Washington has escalated its political provocations, diplomatic pressures
and interference in Chinese internal affairs. As these external pressures
increase, Chinese public opinion turns more nationalistic, which in turn
serves as a basis for US mass media charges of xenophobia and chauvinism
on the part of the Chinese.
The irrational nature of the recent anti-China
propaganda promoted by the US mass media is most evident in the shrill
warnings of a Chinese military threat to Asian security, especially when the
US continues to expand its
chain of military bases encircling China from:
-
South Korea
-
Japan
-
Philippines
-
Australia
-
Afghanistan
-
Central Asia
China has neither military bases abroad nor naval fleets off the coasts of
any US or allied territory.
The greater the US reliance on military force, brutal economic sanctions and
outright blockades to overthrow regimes and extend its network of client
regimes, the greater its hostility toward China, which is expanding its
economic ties with US adversaries, such as,
-
Iran
-
Venezuela
-
Sudan
-
Nicaragua, etc.
The US has severely weakened its productive forces in the process of funding
a
global military machine.
China, on the other hand, has sought to become a
world power on the bases of the long-term, large-scale development of its
productive forces, even in the face of US opposition.
At each and every
turn, Washington has passed up enormous opportunities for the US economy
from Chinas dynamic growth, booming market and overseas economic expansion,
in favor of petty provocations.
Conclusion
Ultimately what we have is a conflict between two diametrically opposing
political economic systems.
On the one hand, a United States military driven empire, which focuses on,
-
conquering Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran
-
backs the ambitions of a militarist
Israel
-
seeks marginal client states in Latin America
-
militarizes Pakistan, Colombia and
Mexico
On the other hand China,
-
deepens its economic ties with dynamic Asian
countries
-
increases its oil links with Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Gulf States,
Venezuela, Russia and Angola
-
displaces the US as the leading trading
partner of Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Chile
-
increases its trade and
investment links with Southern Africa in minerals and related infrastructure
projects
The contrast is striking.
Chinas global economic expansion is confronted by US military encirclement,
diplomatic provocations and a massive anti-Chinese propaganda campaign
designed to deflect US public attention from the extreme imbalances in its
domestic economy.
Instead of looking inward to understand why the US is
declining, the Obama regime encourages the public to blame Chinas
supposedly,
-
unfair trade policies
-
its restrictive investment policies
-
its
manipulated currency rate
-
its tough response to secessionist
movements funded by the US
In the end the US will not resolve its budget deficits and trade imbalances,
not to mention its endless imperial wars, by pandering to self-described
divine rulers, like
the Dali Lama, and provoking a dynamic economic power
such as China.
Nor can Washington escape its profound economic imbalances by
catering to Wall Street speculators and ignoring the decline of Americas
productive forces.
Drones, military surges and surrogate puppet armies
engaged in endless wars are no match for the surging investments, robust
developing markets and joint ventures linking China with the dynamic
emerging economies of the world.
