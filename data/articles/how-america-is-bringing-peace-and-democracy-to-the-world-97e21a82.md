# How America is Bringing 'Peace' and 'Democracy' to The World

We brought peace and democracy to Iraq by
our invading and occupying it in order to get rid of Al Qaeda and
"Saddams WMD" (that war cost the U.S. $3
trillion):

And we brought peace and democracy to
Ukraine by our
overthrowing their corrupt but democratically elected pro-Russian
President and installing a corrupt regime that on May 2nd
massacred hundreds of civilians who opposed the coup and thus caused
a civil war that now has our people
bombing the residents of southeastern Ukraine whom we call
"terrorists" while terrorizing them, into hoped-for submission to the
regime that we have imposed upon them (those people refused to vote in
the election that we held for them):

And, shortly after Obama had become
President, he
and Hillary Clinton brought
'peace' and 'democracy' to Honduras
by our being the only government in the Western Hemisphere to back the
junta that overthrew that countrys democratically elected progressive
President and by replacing him with a string of fascist ones producing
the worlds highest murder-rate in that country:
And, yet, despite all of the peace and
democracy that we are bringing to the world, Gallup international finds
that the nation most often cited around the world as being a threat to
peace
is the United States.
Russian propaganda must have fooled them to
believe that. Or did American
propaganda fool us to
believe what we do?
We are being lied to, again and again,
without our holding to account the people,
...who have lied
to us, again and again.
And thats why we believe the way we do: we
dont hold liars to account, because, if we did, then wed understand
such things as that (and why, and how - as only Bloomberg News, of all
major media,
had the courage to investigate and to report) we are subsidizing
Wall Street by an estimated $83 billion per year, above and beyond the
post-crash bail-outs of Wall Street (which Obama says have all
been paid back).
So: when will we stop voting for Senators
and Congressmen who vote for military appropriations that cause the
United States to outspend all
of the other nine of the top-ten biggest-spending military nations
on Earth?
After all,
-
Why should we spend our tax-dollars
to protect their investments?
-
When will enough lies and death, and
trillions to Wall Street, be enough, to satisfy Americas
aristocracy?
-
Or, will it ever? Ever?
-
When will it stop?
-
Isnt it already outrageous enough?
