On the surface, the economic atmosphere of the
U.S. has appeared rather calm and uneventful.
Stocks are up, employment isn't great but jobs
aren't collapsing into the void (at least not openly), and the U.S. dollar
seems to be going strong. Peel away the thin veneer, however, and a
different financial horror show is revealed.
U.S. stocks have enjoyed unprecedented crash
protection due to a steady infusion of fiat money from the Federal Reserve
known as
quantitative easing.
With the advent of the "taper", QE is now
swiftly coming to a close (as is evident in the overall reduction in
treasury market purchases), and is slated to end by this fall, if not
sooner.
Employment has been boosted only in statistical
presentation, and not in reality. The Labor Department's creative accounting
of job numbers omits numerous factors, the most important being the issue of
long term unemployed. Millions of people who have been jobless for so long
they no longer qualify for benefits are being removed from the rolls.
This
quiet catastrophe has the side bonus of making it appear as though
unemployment is going down.
U.S. Treasury bonds, and by extension the
dollar, have also stayed afloat due to the river of stimulus being
introduced by
the Federal Reserve. That same river, through QE, is now
drying up.
In my article
The Final Swindle of Private American Wealth has Begun,
I outline the data which leads me to believe that the FED taper is a
deliberate action in preparation for an impending market collapse.
The effectiveness of QE stimulus has a
shelf-life, and that shelf life has come to an end. With debt monetization
no longer a useful tool in propping up the ailing U.S. economy, central
bankers are publicly stepping back. Why? If a collapse occurs while stimulus
is in full swing, the FED immediately takes full blame for the calamity,
while being forced to admit that central banking as a concept serves
absolutely no meaningful purpose.
My research over many years has led me to
conclude that a collapse of the American system is not only expected by
international financiers, but is in fact being engineered by them. The FED
is an entity
created by globalists for globalists.
These people have no loyalties to any one
country or culture. Their only loyalties are to themselves and their private
organizations.
While many people assume that the stimulus
measures of the FED are driven by a desire to save our economy and currency,
I see instead a concerted program of destabilization which is meant
to bring about the eventual demise of our nation's fiscal infrastructure.
What some might call "kicking the can down the road," I call deliberately
stretching the country thin over time, so that any indirect crisis can be
used as a trigger event to bring the ceiling crashing down.
In the past several months, the FED taper
of QE and subsequently U.S. bond buying has coincided with steep declines in
purchases by China, a dump of one-fifth of holdings by Russia, and an
overall decline
in new purchases of U.S. dollars for FOREX reserves.
With the Ukraine crisis now escalating to
fever pitch, BRIC nations are openly discussing the probability of
"de-dollarization" in international summits, and the ultimate dumping of the
dollar
as the world reserve currency.
The U.S. is in desperate need of a benefactor to
purchase its ever rising debt and keep the system running. Strangely, a
buyer with apparently bottomless pockets has arrived to pick up the slack
that the FED and the BRICS are leaving behind.
But, who is this buyer?
At first glance, it appears to be the tiny
nation of
Belgium.
While foreign investment in the U.S. has sharply
declined since March, Belgium has quickly become the third largest buyer of
Treasury bonds, just behind China and Japan, purchasing more than $200
billion in securities in the past five months, adding to a total stash of
around $340 billion.
This development is rather bewildering, primarily
because Belgium's GDP as of 2012 was a miniscule $483 billion, meaning,
Belgium has spent nearly the entirety of its yearly GDP on our debt.
Clearly, this is impossible, and someone,
somewhere, is using Belgium as a proxy in order to prop up the U.S. But who?
Recently, a company based in Belgium called
Euroclear has come forward claiming to be the culprit behind the massive
purchases of American debt.
Euroclear, though, is not a direct buyer.
Instead, the bank is a facilitator, using what it calls a "collateral
highway" to allow central banks and international banks to move vast amounts
of securities
around the world faster than ever before.
Euroclear claims to be an administrator for more
than $24 trillion in worldwide assets and transactions, but these
transactions are not initiated by the company itself. Euroclear is a
middleman used by our secret buyer to quickly move U.S. Treasuries into
various accounts without ever being identified.
So the question remains, who
is the true buyer?
My investigation into Euroclear found some
interesting facts. Euroclear has financial relationships with more than 90
percent of the world's central banks and was once partly owned and run by
120 of the largest financial institutions back when it was called the "Euroclear System".
The organization was consolidated and
operated by none other than JP Morgan Bank in 1972. In 2000, Euroclear was
officially incorporated and became its own entity.
However, one must
remember, once a JP Morgan bank,
always a JP Morgan bank.
Another interesting fact - Euroclear also has a
strong relationship with
the Russian government
and is a primary
broker for Russian debt to foreign investors. This once again proves my
ongoing point that Russia is tied to the global banking cabal as much as the
United States. The East vs. West paradigm is a sham of the highest order.
Euroclear's ties to
the banking elite are
obvious; however, we are still no closer to discovering the specific groups
or institution responsible for buying up U.S. debt. I think that the use of Euroclear and Belgium may be a key in understanding this mystery.
Belgium is the political center of the EU, with
more politicians, diplomats and lobbyists than Washington D.C. It is also,
despite its size and economic weakness, a member of an exclusive economic
club called the
"Group
of Ten" (G10).
The G10 nations have all agreed to participate
in a "General Arrangement to Borrow" (GAB) launched in 1962 by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The GAB is designed as an ever cycling fund
which members pay into. In times of emergency, members can ask the IMF's
permission for a release of funds. If the IMF agrees, it then injects
capital through Treasury purchases and SDR allocations.
Essentially, the IMF takes our money, then gives
it back to us in times of desperation (with strings attached).
A similar program called 'New Arrangements To
Borrow' (NAB) involves 38 member countries. This fund was boosted to
approximately 370 billion SDR (or $575 billion dollars U.S.) as the
derivatives crisis struck markets in 2008-2009.
Without a full and
independent audit of the IMF, however, it is impossible to know the exact
funds it has at its disposal, or how many SDR's it has created.
It should be noted the Bank of
International Settlements is also an overseer of the G10. If you want to
learn more about the darker nature of globalist groups like the IMF and the
BIS, read my articles,
Russia Is Dominated by Global Banks, Too, and
False East/West Paradigm Hides The Rise
of Global
Currency.
The following article from Harpers
titled "Ruling The World
of Money," was published in 1983 and
boasts about the secrecy and "ingenuity" of the Bank Of International
Settlements (BIS), an unaccountable body of financiers that dominates the
very
course of economic life around the world.
It is my belief that Belgium, as a member of the
G10 and the GAB/NAB agreements, is being used as a proxy by the BIS and the
IMF to purchase U.S. debt, but at a high price.
I believe that the banking
elite are hiding behind their middleman, Euroclear, because they do not want
their purchases of Treasuries revealed too soon. I believe that the IMF in
particular is accumulating U.S. debt to be used later as leverage to absorb
the dollar and finalize the rise of their SDR currency basket as the world
reserve standard.
Imagine what would happen if all foreign
creditors abandoned U.S. debt purchases because the dollar was no longer
seen as viable as a world reserve currency. Imagine that the Fed's efforts
to stimulate through fiat printing became useless in propping up Treasuries,
serving only to devalue the domestic buying power of our currency.
Imagine
that
the IMF swoops in as the lender of last resort; the only entity willing
to service our debt and keep the system running. Imagine what kind of
concessions America would have to make to a global loan shark like the IMF.
Keep in mind, the plan to replace the dollar is
not mere "theory". In fact, IMF head Christine Lagarde has
openly called for a "global financial system" to take over in the place of the
current dollar based system.
The
Bretton Woods System, established in 1944,
was used by
the United Nations and participating governments to form
international rules of economic conduct, including fixed rates for
currencies and establishing the dollar as the monetary backbone.
The IMF was
created during this shift towards globalization as the BIS slithered into
the background after its business dealings with the Nazis were exposed.
It was the G10, backed by the IMF, that then
signed the Smithsonian Agreement in 1971 which ended the Bretton Woods
system of fixed currencies, as well as any remnants of the gold standard.
This led to the floated currency system we have today, as well as the slow
poison of monetary inflation which has now destroyed more than 98 percent of
the dollar's purchasing power.
I believe the next and final step in the banker
program is to reestablish a new Bretton Woods style system in the wake of an
engineered catastrophe. That is to say, we are about to go full circle.
Perhaps Ukraine will be the cover event, or tensions in the South China Sea.
Just as Bretton Woods was unveiled during World War II,
Bretton Woods redux
may be unveiled during World War III. In either case, the false East/West
paradigm is the most useful ploy
the elites have to bring about a
controlled
decline of the dollar.
The new system will reintroduce the concept of
fixed currencies, but this time, all currencies will be fixed or "pegged" to
the value of the SDR global basket.
The IMF holds a global SDR summit every
five years, and the next meeting is set for the beginning of 2015.
-
If the Chinese yuan is brought into the SDR
basket next year
-
If the BRICS enter into a conjured economic war with the
West
-
If the
dollar is toppled as the world reserve,
...there will be
nothing left in terms of fiscal structure in the way of a global currency
system.
If the public does not remove
the globalist
edifice by force, the IMF and the BIS will then achieve their dream
- the
complete dissolution of economic sovereignty, and the acceptance by the
masses of global financial governance.
The elites don't want to hide behind
the curtain anymore. They want recognition. They want to be
worshiped.
And, it all begins with the secret buyout of
America, the implosion of our debt markets, and the annihilation of our way
of life.
