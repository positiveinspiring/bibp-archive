If theres one thing we know about how the US
government operates, its that the American people are often
the last to know about serious problems that may be taking place behind
the scenes.
This week, in a move that has spooked a lot of
economic and financial analysts, President
Barack
Obama held a special,
closed door meeting with the heads of the U.S. governments financial,
monetary and oversight agencies.
It included members of,
This has left many wondering what is really
going on - and if a serious event is about to take place yet again.
I guess Im always unnerved as a result of
what happened in April, the last time the President of the United States
had a meeting with all of the bank heads, and two days later the price
of gold was smashed for over $200.
Now, the President is meeting with all of
the heads of the various agencies, institutions, the Fed, and all of the
other key money entities in the United States today. Whats that all
about?
But
clearly if the President is having this meeting, there is a crisis
unfolding somewhere in the background, and it could very well relate to
the dollar, interest rates, and the massive derivatives market
associated with interest rates
This surge in interest rates may have already seriously
destabilized the entire financial system, and thats why there is this
meeting taking place in the White House today.
The fact is that the vast majority of derivatives in the global
financial system are related to interest rates.
Now, the entire financial system may be
on the precipice of some sort of
catastrophic event unfolding because of what we have
already seen in the bond market, and how the derivatives are so heavily
intertwined.
Meaning, we may be on the verge of another
disastrous derivatives meltdown.

Ahead of
the
2008 collapse, as the pillars of our financial system were
undergoing a controlled
detonation, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve assured
us (below video) the crisis had been contained:
Bernanke Was 'Wrong'
Experts and pundits on television were screaming
to investors that everything was fine and to keep buying the
dips.
Behind the scenes, however, President
Bush, the Federal Reserve, and the worlds leading financial
institutions were scrambling to figure out how to keep the whole thing from
falling apart.
As former US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson
noted,
we were on the brink of a historic
collapse, and they knew it well ahead of time.
The American people were not as fortunate. Most
of us came to the realization things had taken a turn for the worse only
after 50% of our wealth had been wiped out in a stock market and housing
crash.
Today, like before, all of the experts in
Washington and
the mainstream media are making a point to
reassure us that we are in the midst of an economic recovery.
However, key economic indicators suggest
otherwise.
We are seeing,
Now, as the President meets with a veritable
whos who of government finance, lending and monetary policy one cant help
but think something is amiss.
Are we on the brink of another 'global disaster'?
