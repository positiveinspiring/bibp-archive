Hollywood movies are usually
presented as a form of entertainment, but their plots often
conceal a specific agenda.
"Disaster movies", films about
the end of the world through various mass crises, are
particularly interesting as they all follow the same basic
formula and glorify the same entities.
In this article, we'll look at
the disaster movie 'Contagion' and how it "teaches" its
viewers who to trust and who not to trust during a crisis.
Most people watch movies to be entertained.
Well, I for one can say that there was
absolutely nothing entertaining about Contagion. In fact, the only
difference between this movie and state-sponsored educational movies shown
in schools is that with Contagion you actually have to pay to be
indoctrinated
and to see Matt Damon.
During the cold war, students were shown videos
instructing them to "Duck and Cover" in case of a nuclear attack. Contagion
conditions the masses to expect martial law and to throw themselves at the
first available vaccine in case of a crisis.
Featuring Hollywood mega-stars like Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law
and Gwyneth Paltrow, Contagion is a big-ticket Hollywood movie, but also an
infomercial promoting specific national and international agencies while
encouraging specific behaviors from the public.
The plot of the movie
appears to follow
the big H1N1 scare of 2009 that left many citizens
uncertain about the actual risk of the virus.
Indeed, after months of terrifying news crowned
by a massive vaccination campaign, an important portion of the population
concluded that the H1N1 scare was grossly exaggerated and and thought that
a
vaccine was unnecessary.
This poll taken in November
2009
shows that 53% Canadians
believed that the risks associated with
the H1N1 virus were
exaggerated.
In the wake of this "crisis", the UN's World
Health Organization (known as the WHO) was harshly criticized and even
accused of colluding with
Big Pharma to sell
vaccines.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (the CDC) also had its credibility tarnished as investigations
revealed that the agency
misled the public regarding the number of actual
cases of H1N1 (for example, see
this report from CBS News).
As a result,
these two agencies needed a good PR stunt to restore their credibility and
to scare the hell out of the public. This is where Contagion comes in.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Contagion was produced with the active
cooperation of the CDC, the WHO and other governmental organizations and its
function is clear:
To present a hyper-realistic disaster
scenario to justify the vaccination campaigns promoted by these agencies
while discrediting those who criticize them.
Nothing in the movie hints that it is a work of
fiction. Quite to the contrary, everything in Contagion is made to be as
realistic as possible, using actual locations and governmental agencies, to
make the story as plausible - and as frightening to the masses - as
possible.
As the slogan of the movie says:
"Nothing spreads like fear" and, boy, does
it try to spread fear.
This movie's message is:
"Nothing was exaggerated, and next time
there's a virus outbreak, listen to us
or you'll die".
The Function of Disaster
Movies
Disaster movies are often action-packed thrill rides that venture in the
sometimes fascinating "what if that happened" side of things.
While some are very over-the-top and border on
fantasy, others, like Contagion, emphasize realism and actual events. These
movies tend to "hit home" with the viewers because they lead them to think "this could happen to me".
Disaster movies exploit the latent fear that
recent events caused on the psyche on the masses, tapping into the anxiety
and trauma they cause in order to create tension and terror in the viewers.
Then, the "agenda" aspect of these movies kick
in as they propose to the viewers the best (and only) way these issues can
be resolved.
Specific groups and agencies are cast as
honorable, helpful and trustworthy during the time of crisis, while others
are portrayed as hindrances and even traitors. The drama that follows
becomes a case of predictive programming, as the steps taken in the movie to
resolve the problem will thereafter appear normal to the masses if they ever
occur in real life.
In his book
Propagandes Silencieuses (Silent Propaganda), the journalist and
writer Ignacio Ramonet describes the always present underlying message found
in disaster movies:
"In all cases, the disaster causes a kind of
state of emergency' that hands all powers and modes of transportation
to state authorities: the police, the army or "the crew".
Portrayed as the ultimate recourse, these
institutions are the only ones capable of facing the dangers, the
disorder and the decay threatening society thanks to their structure and
technical knowledge. (
)
As if it was impossible to present to the
general public a disaster that is not resolved by state authorities and
governmental powers."
- Ignacio Ramonet
"Propagandes Silencieuses" (free
translation)
Along with the all-importance of authorities,
the masses are inevitably presented as a herd of idiots prone to panic that
must be kept in the dark.
"Another constant found in disaster movies
is the infantilization of civilians.
The full amplitude of the
catastrophe and the danger the masses are facing is often hidden from
them. They are kept out of any decision making process, with the
exception of managers and technical specialists (engineers, architects,
entrepreneurs) who are sometimes called to intervene in the crises, but
always through state authorities.
The general public is often distracted with pointless entertainment and
encouraged to obey without question to a paternal and benevolent' elite
that is doing everything (to the point of self-sacrifice) to protect
them.
These aspects, along with others, prove that disaster movies, beyond
their entertaining value, also present a political response' to a
crisis.
Behind a naive mode of fantastic storytelling, a silent message
is communicated to the public:
the ruler's profound desire to see
entities such as the army, the police or prominent men' take charge of
the restoration and the rebuilding of a society in crisis, even if this
means partially sacrificing democracy".
- Ibid.
Contagion follows Ramonet's blueprint of
disaster movies to a tee.
Right from the start, specific organizations are
identified as the go-to guys and are automatically given the power to act on
a massive scale, namely,
So what solution does Contagion propose in case of the outbreak of deadly
disease? Martial law and mass vaccinations.
What will happen if ever an actual disease would
break out? Martial law and mass vaccinations. Would the masses questions
this type of drastic response to a crisis which might or might not be
necessary? No, because hundreds of hours of media content have prepared the
masses for this kind of situation.
Let's look at the main components and messages
found in Contagion.
Fear Spreads Faster
Than Germs
The movie starts by showing how a few sick people, who go about their daily
routine, can easily contaminate thousands of people.
The point of the introduction is simple:
A
deadly virus can spread around the world in a matter of days.
This realistic
yet terrifying scenario is a very effective way to grip the audience and to
cause a state of fear.
During these scenes, the camera focuses for a
few extra seconds on common objects that can transmit germs such as drinking
glasses, just long enough for the viewer to realize:
"Hey, I sometimes touch these things! That
could be me! Aaaah!"
This sick guy could infect
the entire bus.
To add to the drama and scare
factor, they name big cities and their population.
Beware of glasses of water being handed to you...
Not even a mother's hug is safe.
Most of those who are infected with the virus do
not live long.
In a series of heartbreaking scenes, one of the
main characters, Mitch Emhoff (played by Matt Damon), sees his wife
and his son lose their lives to the virus.
Viewers watching this tragedy play out are led
to think,
"Hey, that's the most terrible thing could
happen to me! AAaaah!"
Watching Beth Emhoff (played
by Gwyneth Paltrow)
die from the virus is quite
disturbing and certainly helps create a climate of fear.
This movie was released only a two years after
the outbreak of H1N1 and the media hype that surrounded it, so that fear is
still latent in many people. These scenes from Contagion reactivates the
"fear virus" that was planted in people
and adds some.
After a few minutes of panic-inducing scenes,
most viewers will say,
"Oh my God, someone do something about this
virus! This guy lost his wife and child, that's awful! AAArgh!".
Heroes do step up to the plate and take charge
of things
and it just so happens that they were involved in the making of
the movie.
The Organizations That
Take Charge
In Contagion, as soon as the virus becomes a threat, the entire American
government escapes to an "undisclosed location" and "looks for a way of
working online".
Meanwhile, specific real-life non-government
organizations (NGOs) are identified by the movie as the "heroes" and the
go-to people to handle the crisis. These organizations are promoted to the
viewers and are given automatic legitimacy and trustworthiness.
However, those who are educated about the world
elite's agenda for a New World Order know that these organizations have been
know to push that agenda and everything that goes with it.
In short, the
movie says:
"If a crisis like this happens, the
government will disappear, democracy will be suspended and NGOs will
take over".
The agencies identified by the movie are:
-
The CDC (Center for Disease Control),
which has always heavily promoted vaccinations campaigns.
-
The World Health Organization (WHO) -
which was accused, in the wake of the H1N1, of spreading "fear and
confusion rather than immediate information". In the movie however,
the WHO is an important factor in the resolution of the problem.
-
FEMA (Federal Emergency Management
Agency) and the American Red Cross manage the civilians. Contagion,
shows viewers how emergency situations could quickly lead to martial
law, which would automatically lead to the creation of civilian
camps ran by FEMA, who needed some good PR after Hurricane Katrina.
-
Of course, the U.S. army is all over the
place since
martial law is defined as the, "imposition of military
rule by military authorities over designated regions on an emergency
basis".
So, in the wake of a "biological crisis", the
democratically elected American government basically dissolves and specific
organizations (CDC, WHO, FEMA, the U.S. Army) take charge of all aspects of
society.
And this "taking charge" proceeds in a very
specific way: Martial law and civilian camps.
Martial Law
In Contagion, the deadly virus is called MEV-1 and the social result of the
outbreak is portrayed in a specific way.
First, the general population, always depicted
as idiotic, cattle-like and prone to violence, spirals out of control. The
masses are always shown panicking, yelling, stealing, fighting and looting.
This leads to a general breakdown of social
order and a state of lawlessness.
A bunch of rude people
looting a pharmacy to obtain medication.
Wherever regular people are put together, all
sort of crap ensues. This goes along with the concept of "infantilization"
of the masses, who require to be taken charge by "fatherly" authorities.
And boy do the authorities take over.
The US Army imposes Martial
Law and places the State of Minnesota in quarantine,
blocking all traffic
out of the state.
Those who seek to leave the
state
are told to turn around and
go back home.
Citizens are then directed to
FEMA camps.
This stadium has been turned
into a FEMA camp.
Civilians (even healthy ones) have their rights revoked and are directed to
FEMA camps
where they are fed and
lodged. In this scene, the lack of "individual meals"
to feed all of the camp's
population causes a small riot.
The Conspiracy
Theorist
If specific groups and organizations are identified by the movie as
"competent" and "trustworthy", other groups get a very different treatment,
namely alternative media.
Personified by a blogger named Alan Krumwiede
(played by Jude Law), alternative media are presented as unreliable sources
bent on sensationalism and profit. In other words, the movie implies that
information that does not come from "official" sources is invalid and
potentially dangerous.
Not exactly a pro-free-speech message.
"Truth Serum", a blog run by
Alan Krumwiede,
resembles the many
"alternative news" website around the web.
This type of information,
which does not come from mass media
or governmental sources, is
definitely not portrayed in a positive light.
Right from the start, Alan Krumwiede is
portrayed as a somewhat dodgy blogger with a questionable work ethic and who
does not get much respect from the journalistic nor the scientific
community.
When he tries to get one of his stories published in a newspaper
called The Chronicle, he gets rejected due to lack of evidence behind his
story.
When he contacts a scientist regarding the
virus, the scientist replies:
"Blogging is not writing, it's graffiti with
punctuation".
Despite this lack of respect from "competent"
bodies, Alan Krumwiede has a wide audience and proudly boasts "millions of
unique visitors per day" on his website.
On it, he claims that a cure for the MEV-1 virus
exists and is named Forsythia but it is repressed by the powers that be to
sell vaccines. He also urges his readers not to take the vaccine that is
given out by authorities.
The government apparently does not tolerate this kind of dissent. Krumwiede
gets set up by an undercover agent to get him arrested.
When he discovers the ploy against him the agent
tells Krumwiede:
"Alan, I didn't have a choice, they've seen
your blog".
Government agents then appear out of nowhere and
arrest Krumwiede for,
"security fraud, conspiracy and most likely
man slaughter".
Krumwiede is arrested due to
the contents of his blog.
Contagion sends out a
powerful message against "alternative" information sources:
Diverging from "official
sources" is dangerous and 'against the law.'
It is later learned that Forsythia was a lie and
that Krumwiede made 4.5 million dollars by promoting it to his readers. The
chief of Homeland Security wants to put him in jail for a "long, long time".
However, due to his popularity, Krumwiede makes
bail because, as the chief of Homeland Security states:
"Evidently, there are 12 million people as
crazy as you are".
The character of Alan Krumwiede and the way he
is portrayed is interesting for several reasons.
-
First, he reflects the growing influence
of blogs and alternative websites on public opinion - a recent
phenomena that does not sit well with the elite that seeks to have
the monopoly of information. By depicting this character as
dishonest, corrupt and even dangerous to the public, the movie
justifies the shunning of such writers and even their arrest. Nobody
in the movie seems to mind that all of this is in direct violation
of the First Amendment.
-
Second, when the H1N1 vaccine was
released in 2009 and mass vaccination campaigns were organized, many
citizens and authoritative figures including public health
officials, doctors and specialists spoke against it. They claimed
that the vaccine was unnecessary, insufficiently tested and that it
had negative side-effects.
By associating the corrupt figure of Alan
Krumwiede with the "anti-vaccine movement", the movie discredits all of
those who question the necessity of mass vaccination campaigns.
If another
virus should strike, viewers of Contagion might be more prone to ignore
these movements.
In other words, the movie says:
"Conspiracy theorists are corrupt liars that
are dangerous to public safety and they should be arrested. Do not
listen to them. They make money off phony cures.
HOWEVER, those who make
even more money off phony vaccines are good. Listen to authorities and
get the vaccine
or you'll die."
The Ultimate Solution
After months of horror and hundreds of millions of deaths, a final solution
emerges and saves humanity: Mass vaccination.
The only solution to do virus
problem?
A mass vaccination campaign.
Those who receive the vaccine get the privilege
of wearing a scannable wristband. This allows them to go to public places
such as shopping malls.
You get vaccinated, you get a
barcode and go places.
You don't get vaccinated, you
stay at home... and you die.
In Conclusion
Contagion may be presented as a work of 'fiction,' but it communicates several
important messages that authorities need the public to accept.
To do so, the movie defines a specific problem
that has actually occurred in the past, it identifies the agencies that have
the right to take charge of the situation and proposes the only solution
required to fix the problem.
That solution is not pretty:
-
the dissolution of the government
-
the
imposition of martial law
-
the creation of civilian camps
-
forced
vaccination campaigns and the suppression of free speech
Democracy and
civil rights are summarily suspended and we witness the establishment of
a highly controlled and monitored society (using barcodes).
Are disaster movies such as Contagion solely
created for entertainment or are they also used to teach the public about
what is acceptable and what is not when a disaster occurs? Would the World
Health Organization participate in a movie simply to entertain people?
Interesting fact:
The movie was released on DVD at the same
time the WHO got accused of
exaggerating the death rate of the 'new' H5N1
bird flu.
The WHO has also recently allowed the
publication of controversial research describing the
creation of a mutant
and highly contagious version of the virus.
Could a weaponized version of
the virus be purposely released on the public to
justify martial law? Wait,
maybe I shouldn't say things like that.
I don't want to get arrested for,
"security fraud, conspiracy and most likely
man slaughter".
