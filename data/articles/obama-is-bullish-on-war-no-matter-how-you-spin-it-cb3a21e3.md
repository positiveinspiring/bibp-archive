# Obama is Bullish on War - No Matter How You Spin It

Barack Obama has now been at
war longer than any president in United States history,
as the New York Times
pointed out on Sunday.
Barring some sort of peace
miracle in the next six months, he will be the only
president who ever served two full terms in office while
constantly being at war. And given how he has
transformed how the US fights overseas, his wars will
likely continue long after he leaves office.
Anytime the media writes
about Obama and war, it's apparently a rule that the
author must mention that Obama supposedly fights his
wars more 'reluctantly' than his predecessors.
But in many contexts, this
is misleading...
Obama hasn't attempted to avoid war; he
has merely redefined it. In some ways, he has fought
them in a far more aggressively than any president
before him, just with different tools.
Gone are the battalions of
tens of thousands of soldiers, torching everything in
their paths.
Obama's wars are fought with
special forces, drones and other high-tech weaponry
that, he argues, lead to fewer American deaths. But they
pose the same dangers to world peace that the wars in
Vietnam and Iraq once did, while making them far easier
to fight.
Obama's hallmark has been
drone strikes, which he has used to bomb at least seven
countries since becoming president.
"Barring some
sort of peace miracle in the next six months,"
writes Timm, President
Obama "will be the only president
who ever served two
full terms in office
while constantly being
at war."

For all the talk of their
precision and pin-pointedness, though, drones regularly
kill additional people and have resulted in hundreds of
civilian deaths.
These strikes cause
blowback and stoke anti-American hatred in virtually
every country they fly in, and
many former
officials say the program does more harm than good.
But it's not just drones.
Instead of being straightforward with the public, his
administration hides behind secrecy and word gymnastics
in all facets of its war policy, keeping the number of
exact number of troops in the Middle East hidden from
the public, and re-defining words like "combat"
and "boots
on the ground" and "civilians"
to mask how much killing is really going on.
Even the word "end" has lost
all meaning.
Obama
declared the "end" of the Iraq war in 2011
only to
start sending troops back...
In Afghanistan, he didn't
even go through that formality. While he
declared the Afghanistan war over in 2014, thousands
troops continue to fight, and sometimes die, inside the
country to this day.
There is
no definite timetable for when they will leave, if
ever.
How many troops are in each
country exactly?
Well as
the Times points out,
we don't know, since the
Pentagon refuses to say. We
do know that there are at least tenfold more troops
in Iraq now than there were in the latter half of 2014,
when Obama went on television and said that the US would
be conducting "limited" airstrikes there.
Since then, more than 25,000
bombs have been dropped in Iraq, Syria, Libya and
elsewhere.
For a reluctant warrior,
Obama
also has smashed records for selling weaponry and
arms to our Middle East "allies", many of whom continue
to wage their own wars of destruction. One of those
wars, Saudi Arabia's, has thrown Yemen into chaos and
strengthened al-Qaida, which has, in turn, led to Obama
sending US troops back into the country.
The timetable on that fight?
"Short term",
a Pentagon spokesman said last week.
This is not to say Obama's
wars are completely comparable to his predecessors',
including those of
George W Bush - his
Iraq war remains the most calamitous
foreign policy mistake of our
generation.
And with each passing year, despite the fact
that no one wants to admit it, the Afghanistan war
inches closer to the same.
But at least Bush fought his
wars with authorization from Congress, something that
Obama has refused to do with his war on Isis, despite
the constitution requiring it. Maybe this isn't solely
the Obama administration's fault.
Congress has shown itself to
be cowardly in upholding its constitutional
responsibility, content with the president taking all
the blame when things go wrong.
But the Obama administration
has continually refused put forth its own plan for an
Isis war authorization beyond a couple of soundbites
saying it'd be nice if Congress passed one (while also
making clear it won't make a difference either way).
Whoever the next president
is, there's little chance he or she uses these powers
less. Donald Trump is
an unpredictable maniac who denounces military
interventions in one breath and promises them in the
next.
Hillary Clinton, a longtime
favorite of the neocon crowd even
before Trump became the Republican nominee, has
supported virtually every aggressive US military action
in the past 15 years and has already
promised more military intervention than Obama.
Rather than being remembered
as the reluctant 'warrior', pushed into war by
circumstance, there is far more likelihood Obama
will be remembered as the opposite:
the president who
cemented the forever war mentality and architecture
that has continually expanded, and that tragically
shows no signs of slowing...
