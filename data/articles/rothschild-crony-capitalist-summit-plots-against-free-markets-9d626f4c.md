Under the guise of re-defining and improving
what they inaccurately called "capitalism," top insiders representing
institutions that control some $30 trillion in assets met at a
Rothschild-sponsored "Inclusive Capitalism" summit in London to push
what sounded suspiciously like
global tyranny.
From the IMF boss Christine Lagarde
quoting Karl Marx to crony capitalist CEOs and central bankers pushing
radical notions of "sustainability" the globalist bigwigs consistently
blamed what little remains of the free market for the horrific failures of
socialism, central banking, and Big Government.
Ironically, many of the attendees enriched by
fleecing taxpayers via government were tripping over themselves to advocate
more wealth redistribution and taxes.
The conference, held in late May, was convened
by Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who married into the infamous,
unimaginably wealthy
Rothschild banking
dynasty that extracted much of its obscene fortune from humanity
using the coercive power of government.
Attendees and speakers included,
-
Prince
Charles
-
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
chief Christine Lagarde (shown above)
-
former U.S. President
Bill Clinton
-
Bank of England boss Mark Carney
-
former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry
Summers,
...and more.
Also in attendance: pension-fund bosses, Big
Business CEOs, and other top figures representing an estimated one third of
the world's investable wealth. Among the "supporting organizations" for the
summit were the
CIA-linked Ford Foundation and the globalist Rockefeller Foundation:
While pretending to defend what they call
"capitalism," the crony capitalists behind the summit and in attendance were
hardly speaking of genuine free markets in the traditionally understood
sense of the term.
In fact, the powerful attendees were referring
to the Big Government system that has existed in recent decades - a
plutocratic economic regime in which currencies and interest rates are
controlled by
privately owned central banks; where the fastest way to
get rich is to buy politicians; and where governments squander around half
of the people's wealth on their scheming even in supposedly "capitalist"
countries.
One of the speakers at the invitation-only
summit was Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, an organization which
for decades has worked to extract wealth from the Third World to enrich the
establishment while imposing failed crony-capitalist regimes on its victim
nations.
Throughout her speech, the IMF chief's disdain
for free markets and human liberty came through loud and clear. Incredibly,
she even quoted Karl Marx, claiming that capitalism,
"carried the seeds of its own destruction."
She then quoted Pope Francis as saying that
"inequality" is "the root of social evil." The Bible, by contrast,
says the love of money is the root of all evil. (1 Timothy 6:10)
The IMF boss also blasted the notion that,
"ultimately we should care about equality of
opportunity, not equality of outcome."
According to Lagarde, opportunity can never be
equal in an unequal society.
To deal with what she claims to view as a
problem, the increasingly radical figure prescribed classic Marxist
"solutions":
more "progressive" income-tax regimes for wealth
redistribution, a heavier tax burden on property owners, and more.
"Transfers and income taxes have been able
to reduce inequality by about a third, on average, among the advanced
economies," she claimed.
As reported, the IMF Lagarde runs is currently
plotting to transform itself into a sort of
global central bank in charge of a
world currency.
It also called last year for
fleecing humanity to
prop up debt-laden governments and mega-banks.
Other speakers outlined similar plots under
various guises. Population-control zealot Prince Charles, for example, cited
discredited theories about humanity's alleged role in "global warming" -
temperature increases have been
missing in action for 18 years and counting
despite the hysteria and predictions - to demand a radical redesign of society and business.
Going even further into the realm of the absurd,
British central bank boss Carney lambasted alleged free-market
"radicalism" while calling for a truly radical vision of even more powerful,
centralized, and oppressive government.
"Just as any revolution eats its children,
unchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential
for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself," he claimed,
outlandishly blaming non-existent free markets for the latest economic
crisis rather than the
central-banking gimmicks and Big Government plots that largely
caused it.
At the top of the "Inclusive Capitalism" summit
agenda, meanwhile, were several radical notions long pushed by the upper
echelons of the globalist establishment.
One, for example, involves prodding companies to
put shareholder interests aside in favor of nebulous "environmental" and
"social" responsibilities aligned with draconian United Nations visions of "sustainable
development" and
Agenda 21.
The Rockefeller Foundation has been a
key player in the ongoing effort, partly funded by U.S. taxpayers, to
create alleged "socially responsible" companies and undermine what little
remains of the free market. Another key element of the "Inclusive" plot
involves a further blurring of the lines between government and the private
sector.
In a
column about the conference written by Unilever CEO Paul Polman
and Lynn Forester de Rothschild, the CEO of E.L. Rothschild and
co-chair of the neocon "Henry Jackson Initiative for Inclusive Capitalism,"
the two offer a wide range of attacks on free markets.
According to the piece, free markets have
"proved dysfunctional in important ways."
Among those alleged "capitalism" dysfunctions:
"It often encourages shortsightedness,
contributes to wide disparities between the rich and the poor, and
tolerates the reckless treatment of environmental capital."
Of course, in the real world, free markets
encourage long-range planning by companies to best satisfy the needs and
wants of consumers while creating value for shareholders.
Competition in the market, meanwhile, ensures
fair prices and high quality while protecting consumers and workers alike.
While it is true that liberty necessarily means some will be wealthier than
others - those who work hardest, invent popular products, innovate, and more
will obviously be rewarded - even the briefest honest examination would
reveal genuinely horrifying inequality under non-free systems.
Just examine the lifestyles of top officials in
communist regimes compared with the misery and poverty inflicted on those
they enslave. Finally, the notion that genuine free markets "tolerate"
environmental destruction is absurd on its face. Compare the environment in
Russia or China with the West.
Strong property rights
have long been shown to be the best way to
safeguard the environment.
Rothschild and Polman also lament that less than
half of the global population trusts government. Considering the fact that
governments murdered hundreds of millions of people in the last century, it
is easy to see why.
For the bigwig crony capitalists of the world,
the mass-murdering Communist Chinese dictatorship is doing it right on
everything from "global warming" and economics to "corruption"
and more.
Writing in the
New York Times,
David Rockefeller even claimed the,
"social experiment in China under Chairman
Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human
history."
It also killed at least 60 million innocent
human beings. Indeed, for the globalists at the "Inclusive Capitalism"
confab, the lack of trust in government is a problem rather than an obvious
and logical reaction to history and circumstances.
"Disillusioned with both state and market,
people increasingly ask whether capitalism, as we practice it, is worth
the costs," the two continued, again ignoring the fact that the system
that exists today is not genuine capitalism but rather a mix of crony
capitalism and socialism.
"We see this in movements such as Earth Day
and Occupy Wall Street. In many parts of the world - from the Arab
Spring countries to Brazil, Turkey, Venezuela, and Ukraine, frustrated
publics are taking to the streets."
Of course, aside from the outside role in
fomenting many of those protest movements, every one of the countries
mentioned is ruled by tyranny of some variety - especially of the socialist
and Islamist sorts.
Occupy Wall Street, meanwhile, was
bankrolled by billionaire statist
George
Soros, whose wealth was amassed
with
plenty of assistance from the Rothschild
dynasty.
Soros also
played a major role in Ukraine.
Then, the two bigwigs - "plutocrats," according
to Politico magazine - call for more of
what can only be described as fascism, properly defined.
"Addressing the failures of modern
capitalism will require strong leadership and
extensive cooperation between businesses, governments, and NGOs,"
the two claimed in their column without having cited a single 'failure'
that can properly be attributed to free markets rather than government
and the central-banking cartels.
"Transformational change will come only from
businesses and others acting together." If those schemes sound
suspiciously like fascism as defined by Mussolini, good - they should.
"Though our work has only just started, we
are convinced that within a generation we can redefine capitalism and
build a sustainable and equitable global economy," they added.
Finally, the two tout radical crony-capitalist,
UN-promoting outfits such as the,
"World Business Council for Sustainable
Development" and the "Consumer Goods Forum" for "uniting key industry
players and putting pressure on governments to join forces in the search
for sustainable capitalism."
As reported from the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in
Rio de Janeiro, the movement is
far more sinister than the
innocent-sounding names would suggest.
Last year, even corporate giant
Monsanto - known
for its controversial crony business model, lobbying, and its widely
criticized genetically modified organisms (GMOs) -
officially joined the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development.
The group of powerful interests includes
bailed-out mega-banks and Big Oil, all united in pushing the UN's
totalitarian-minded "Agenda 21" scheme for "sustainability."
Purporting to tackle "inequality" with bigger
and more oppressive government is also at the top of the "Inclusive
Capitalism" agenda.
Thomas Piketty recently released a major
propaganda book purporting to justify all of the anti-capitalist extremism
masquerading as support for "improving" capitalism and using government to
make everyone more "equal."
Author Hunter Lewis, the co-founder of
AgainstCronyCapitalism.org and former CEO of global investment firm
Cambridge Associates, however,
explained that government has been the
"principal cause" of growing inequality.
"Crony capitalism is the opposite of
capitalism," he noted in the recent piece. "It is a perversion of
markets, not the result of free prices and free markets."
Lewis also said Piketty's new book serves the
same purpose as Keynes' Big Government theories - serving "the same
short-sighted, destructive policies."
John McManus, president of
The John Birch Society, has
also long spoken out about how crony and monopoly "capitalists" seek to use
government for their own benefit.
"Blaming the free market' for escalating
social ills is akin to blaming wet streets for rain," he said.
"When the market is truly free, upward
economic mobility occurs. When the engines of real wealth production
become constrained by taxation, regulation, and controls, economic
stagnation followed by economic downturn is assured."
Citing various examples, McManus also noted that
"big business found out that big government was its ally."
"The greatest advocates of socialism in the
past 100 years have been Stalin, Hitler, Mao Tse-tung, Castro, and a
swarm of lesser-known criminals," he continued.
"What these pariahs established is the way
America and the rest of the world is heading. It is called the 'New
World Order,' and it is being created by government leaders,
monopolistic crony' capitalists, and international socialists.
People
who wish to remain free had better get involved in the fight to rein in
government and repudiate the wealth impeders or the future will not be
kind."
It is true that the world and humanity face
major problems that must be addressed - even in terms of pseudo-capitalists
exploiting the population via government to benefit themselves.
The root of those afflictions, though, has been
deliberately misdiagnosed by the bigwigs who met in London.
The
prescriptions offered at the Rothschild summit will only lead to more
exploitation, more tyranny, more centralized and less accountable
government, more unearned wealth for the establishment, and more human
misery.
What humanity really needs are freer markets,
honest money as opposed to cartel-owned central-banking scams, honest
government, more freedom, more faith, and respect for individual rights.
