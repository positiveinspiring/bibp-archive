Snowden's leaks
show how the Internet
can be turned against
us.
The original vision of the Internet, where
information and media is freely shared, without ones computer strokes and
searches being metered, tracked, traced, archived, dissected, marketed and
warehoused in government data banks, is dead.
And thats whats being lost
by mainstream media in the ongoing
Edward Snowden coverage.
The Snowden story is not about whether Snowden
is a spy, or U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will seek the death penalty,
or whether Russian President Vladamir Putin will let him stay, or what dark
novels his Russian lawyer has given him, or what clean clothes he has.
It
is, as the U.K. Guardian notes, what
Snowden has revealed about todays Internet.
Snowdens revelations are the end of a vision of
unfettered Internet freedom. Over the past decade, weve heard all kinds of
pronouncements that the Internet is in its death throes. Technically
speaking, the net is bigger, more alive and more people are interconnected
than ever.
But what has died amid the Internets evolution?
In 2002, Jeff Chester, executive director of the
Center for Digital Democracy, wrote that
big telecom companies were going to kill the net by charging for data use,
like a utility charges for the water piped into ones home. Gamers were
particularly upset about that scenario. Todays bigger and faster data pipes
seem to have offset the fear of restricted access. But todays Internet
users pay just as Chester predicted.
Last years SOPA fights
raised another Internet deathbed scenario:
the prospect that there might be
government censorship of
content, because industries built on creating content could not stop its
theft and demanded that Congress protect the intellectual property.
The
fight became so rancorous it killed congressional action. The Internet
didnt die, of course, but kept growing, with big technology firms
increasingly capturing humanitys keystrokes for their own marketing
purposes.
A decade ago, few people forecast that the nets
growth would mean the disintegration of privacy for just about everyone who
uses computers and digital devices.
But thats whats at the heart of
Snowdens disclosures.
And its not just a loss of personal privacy to the
corporate sector -
Google,
Facebook, AT&T and the like - but its loss to the
federal governments spy agencies, police and secret courts.
Repeat after me: Edward Snowden is not the
story, wrote the U.K.
Guardians John Naughton last weekend. The story is what he has revealed
about our networked world. This insight seems to have escaped most of the
worlds mainstream media.
Snowden told Americans and the world that their
governments - so-called democracies whose legacies in the 20th century
include defeating fascism and expanding individual civil rights against
state power - were spying on them.
Its not the same as the Soviets in the
Cold War. Its slicker and smarter:
just collect and siphon and sort our
data trails and digital fingerprints for later scrutiny.
Every call, e-mail,
search and move is fair game.
A lot of people have responded to Snowdens
revelations with a shrug, saying,
I have nothing to hide.
But that misses
the point.
Its bad enough that private companies track our movements,
tastes, habits, health and networks, all to sell us more stuff. But when
governments do the same thing,
creating a domestic spying industry with
hundreds of thousands of contractors, the potential for abuse is
frightening.
That digital dragnet is what Snowden has been
trying to bring into the open and reform: the Internet, once one of our
greatest tools, can be turned against us.
History has shown that he is correct.
The
20th centurys targets of totalitarian states had almost nowhere to run. The
enemies of Egypts military coup, like them or not, are not so secretly
being rounded up and arrested. And Snowden, the messenger in a global
Internet-based spying scandal, is now a man without a country.
The Internet is not dead or dying. But its not
our best friend forever.
And as Americas spymasters and its global
companies keep defending their digital dragnet, Snowdens revelations remind
us what the Internet has become.
