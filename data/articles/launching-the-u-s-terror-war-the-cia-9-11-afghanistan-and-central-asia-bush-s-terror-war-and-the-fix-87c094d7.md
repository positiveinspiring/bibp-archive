On
September 11, 2001, within hours of the
murderous 9/11 attacks, Bush, Rumsfeld, and Cheney had committed America to
what they later called the War on Terror.
It should more properly, I believe, be called
the Terror War, one in which terror has been directed repeatedly against
civilians by all participants, both states and non-state actors.1
It should also be seen as part of a larger,
indeed global, process in which terror has been used against civilians in
interrelated campaigns by all major powers, including China in Xinjiang and
Russia in Chechnya, as well as the United States.2
Terror war in its global context should perhaps
be seen as the latest stage of the age-long secular spread of transurban
civilization into areas of mostly rural resistance - areas where
conventional forms of warfare, for either geographic or cultural reasons,
prove inconclusive.
Terror War was formally declared by
George W. Bush on the evening of
September 11, 2001, with his statement to the American nation that,
"we will make no distinction between the
terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them." 3
But the notion that Bushs terror war was in
pursuit of actual terrorists lost credibility in 2003, when it was applied
to Saddam Husseins Iraq, a country known to have been targeted by
terrorists but not to have harbored them.4
It lost still more credibility with the 2005
publication in Britain of the so-called Downing Street memo, in which the
head of the British intelligence service MI6 reported after a visit to
Washington in 2002 that,
"Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein,
through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and
WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy."
5
False stories followed in due course linking
Iraq to WMD, anthrax, and Niger yellowcake (uranium).
This essay will demonstrate that before 9/11 a small element inside the
CIAs Bin Laden Unit and related agencies, the so-called Alec Station Group,
were also busy, fixing intelligence by suppressing it, in a way which,
accidentally or deliberately, enabled the Terror War. They did so by
withholding evidence from the FBI before 9/11 about two of the eventual
alleged hijackers on 9/11, Khalid Al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, thus
ensuring that the FBI could not surveil the two men or their colleagues.
This failure to share was recognized in the 9/11 Commission Report, but
treated as an accident that might not have occurred if more resources had
been applied. 6
This explanation, however, has since been
refuted by 9/11 Commission Chairman Tom Kean.
Asked recently by two filmmakers if the failure
to deal appropriately with al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi could have been a simple
mistake, Kean replied:
Oh, it wasnt careless oversight. It was
purposeful. No question about that... The conclusion that we came to was
that in the DNA of these organizations was secrecy. And secrecy to the
point of ya dont share it with anybody.7
In 2011 an important book by Kevin Fenton,
Disconnecting the Dots, demonstrated conclusively that the withholding was
purposive, and sustained over a period of eighteen months.8
This interference and manipulation became
particularly blatant and controversial in the days before 9/11; it led one
FBI agent, Steve Bongardt, to predict accurately on August 29, less than two
weeks before 9/11, that someday someone will die. 9
As will be seen, the motives for this withholding remain inscrutable.
At one time I was satisfied with Lawrence
Wrights speculations that the CIA may have wanted to recruit the two
Saudis; and that,
The CIA may also have been protecting an
overseas operation [possibly in conjunction with Saudi Arabia] and was
afraid that the F.B.I. would expose it.10
The purpose of this essay is to suggest that the
motives for the withholding may have had to do with the much larger neocon
objective being imposed on American foreign policy at this same time:
the consolidation of U.S. global hegemony by
the establishment of U.S. forward-based bases around the oil fields of
Central Asia.
In short, the withholding of evidence should be
seen as part of the larger ominous pattern of the time, including the
malperformance of the U.S. government (USG) in response to the 9/11 attacks,
and the murderous
anthrax letters which helped secure the passage of the
Patriot Act.
I am now persuaded by Fenton that Lawrence Wrights explanation, that the
CIA was protecting a covert operation, may explain the beginnings of the
withholding in January 2000, but cannot explain its renewal in the days just
before 9/11.
Fenton analyzes a list of thirty-five different
occasions where the two alleged hijackers were protected in this fashion,
from January 2000 to about September 5, 2001, less than a week before the
hijackings.11
We shall see that in his analysis, the incidents
fall into two main groups.
The motive he attributes to the earlier ones,
was,
to cover a CIA operation that was already
in progress.12
However after the system was blinking red in
the summer of 2001, and the CIA expected an imminent attack, Fenton can see
no other explanation than that,
the purpose of withholding the information
had become to allow the attacks to go forward.13
Fentons second sentence would imply that a
homicidal crime was committed by members of the Alec Station group, even if
the crime was one of manslaughter (unintended homicide) rather than
deliberate and premeditated murder.
One can imagine benign reasons for withholding
the information: for example, the CIA may have been tolerating the behavior
of the two Saudis in order to track down their associates. In this case, we
would be dealing with no more than a miscalculation - albeit a homicidal
miscalculation.
The Terror War and the
Rumsfeld-Cheney-Wolfowitz Project of Global Dominion
But in the course of this essay I shall dwell on the activities of the head
of the CIAs Bin Laden Unit, Richard Blee, in Uzbekistan as well as
Afghanistan.
Uzbekistan was an area of concern not only to Blee and his
superior Cofer Black; it was also in an area of major interest to
Richard Cheney, whose corporation Halliburton had been active since 1997 or
earlier in developing the petroleum reserves of Central Asia.
Cheney himself said in a speech to oil
industrialists in 1998,
"I cannot think of a time when we have had a
region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the
Caspian.14
I shall suggest that the purpose as well as the
result of protecting the two Saudis may have been to fulfill the objectives
of Cheney, Rumsfeld, and the Project for the New American Century (PNAC)
neocon group for establishing forward-based forces in Central Asia.15
We shall see that a phone call on 9/11 from CIA
Director Tenet to Stephen Cambone, a key PNAC figure in the Pentagon,
apparently transmitted some of the privileged information that never reached
the FBI.
This neocon agenda was partially to maintain American and Israeli domination
of the region for security purposes, and (as we shall see) to create the
conditions for future unilateral preemptive actions against unfriendly
states like Iraq. In particular it was designed to establish new secure
bases in the Middle East, anticipating Donald Rumsfelds predictable
announcement in 2003 that the U.S. would pull virtually all of its troops,
except some training personnel, out of Saudi Arabia.16
But it was partly also to strengthen American
influence in particular over the newly liberated states of Central Asia,
with their sizable unproven oil and gas reserves.
Fentons alarming conclusion about CIA actions leading up to the 9/11
attacks makes more sense in the context of this agenda, and also in the
context of three other revealing anomalies about Bushs Terror War.
The first is the paradox that this supposed
pursuit of al-Qaeda was conducted in alliance with the two nations, Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan, that were most actively supporting Al Qaeda in other
parts of the world. In this essay we shall see U.S. and Saudi intelligence
cooperating in such a way as to protect, rather than neutralize, Saudi
agents in al Qaeda.
The second anomaly is that although
the CIA may have been focused on
crushing al Qaeda, Rumsfeld and Cheney were intent from the outset on a much
wider war.
In September 2001 there was no intelligence on
9/11 linking the attacks to Iraq, yet Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld,
supported by his deputy Paul Wolfowitz, was already observing on September
12,
that there were no decent targets for
bombing in Afghanistan and that we should consider bombing Iraq, which,
he said, had better targets.17
Rumsfelds argument was supported by a Defense
Department paper prepared for the ensuing Camp David meetings of September
15-16, which,
proposed that the immediate priority
targets for initial action should be al Qaeda, the Taliban, and Iraq.18
Iraq had been a target for Rumsfeld and
Wolfowitz since at least 1998, when the two men co-signed a PNAC letter to
President Clinton, calling for the removal of Saddam Husseins regime from
power.19
But Iraq was not the only target in the
Cheney-Rumsfeld-Wolfowitz agenda, which since at least 1992 had been nothing
less than global U.S. dominance, or what former U.S. Colonel Andrew Bacevich
called permanent American global hegemony.20
It was a high priority for the neocons.
Even
before Bush had been elected by the Supreme Court in December 2000, Cheney
was at work securing key posts for the 1998 letters cosigners (including
Richard Armitage, John Bolton, Richard Perle, along with other PNAC
personnel like Stephen Cambone) in the White House, State, and Defense.
The terror war from its outset was designed as an instrument to implement
this objective.
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice on September 24,
raised the issue of state sponsorship of
terrorism: What is our strategy with respect to countries that support
terrorism like Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Sudan?21
In his memoir, General Wesley Clark reports that
the question had evolved by November into a Pentagon five-year plan:
As I went back through the Pentagon in
November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a
chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said.
But
there was more. This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign
plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with
Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon,
Libya,
Iran, Somalia and Sudan.22
At about this time, former CIA officer Reuel
Marc Gerecht published an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for
a change of regime in Iran and Syria.23 (Gerecht continues to
warn in The Weekly Standard about the menace of both nations today.)
In the Clinton era Gerecht, like Cheney and Rumsfeld, had been part of the
Project for the New American Century, a hawkish group calling both for
action against Iraq in particular and also more generally for an expanded
defense budget that would increase defense spending significantly in the
cause of American leadership.
The PNAC report of September 2000 - Rebuilding
Americas Defenses had much to say about Gulf oil and the importance of
retaining and strengthening forward-based forces in the region.24
It is relevant that by the end of 2001, in the wake of 9/11 and the Terror
War, the United States had already established new bases in Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, and was thus better positioned to influence the
behavior of the newly liberated governments in the huge oil and gas region
east of the Caspian.
In the course of this essay we shall see that
the agreement to use the first and one of the most important of these bases,
Karshi-Khanabad or K-2 in Uzbekistan, grew out of an earlier CIA liaison
agreement negotiated in 1999 by Richard Blee of the Alec Station Group, a
central figure in this essay.
Most Americans are unaware that on 9/11 U.S.
Special Forces were already at K-2 on an Uzbek training mission, and that by
September 22, two weeks before a formal U.S.-Uzbek military agreement,
the CIA was already flying its teams into
the massive Karshi-Khanabad, or K2, air base in southern Uzbekistan,
where U.S. army engineers were repairing the runway.25

including Karshi-Khanabad
A third anomaly is that the Terror War led to a
dramatic increase in the resort to terror, and even torture, by America
itself, including against its own citizens.
In this context it is relevant that Cheney and
Rumsfeld, through their participation in the Defense Departments
super-secret Doomsday Project, had also been part of Continuity of
Government (COG) planning for undermining the U.S. Bill of Rights by the
warrantless surveillance and detention of dissenters.26
These plans, dating back to the fear of
Communists in the McCarthyite 1950s, have been the underpinnings for the
elaborate plans in the Pentagon and elsewhere for dealing with antiwar
protests against the Pentagons plans for global domination.
As I have argued elsewhere, the U.S. is now spending billions every year on
Homeland Security in no small part because of the belief, articulated by
Marine Colonel Oliver North, that the Vietnam War was lost in the streets of
America, and that this deterrent to U.S. military operations needed to be
dealt with.27 Cheney and Rumsfeld, as part of the so-called
Doomsday Project for Continuity of Government (COG) planning, had been part
of this effort also.28
In short, 9/11 fulfilled agendas long
contemplated by a small group of officials for radical new policies both in
Central Asia and also inside America.
The homicidal crime suggested by Fentons meticulous research is one both
difficult and painful to contemplate. America is in a crisis today because
of the activities of the Banks Too Big to Fail, which, as has been pointed
out, were also Banks Too Big to Jail - for to punish them as criminals would
endanger Americas already threatened financial structure.29
This essay, though detailed, is dealing with
something analogous, what may have been a Crime Too Big to Punish.
9/11, as will be developed in this essay, has other points in common with
the John F. Kennedy assassination.
The Cover-Up of 9/11
and of the CIAs Role in Letting It Happen
After ten years it is important to reassess what we know and do not know
about the events that culminated in 9/11, particularly the actions of the
CIA and the FBI and the denial of critical information to
the 9/11
Commission.
Today, we can confidently say:
-
the most important truths still remain
unknown, in large part because many of the most important documents
are still either unreleased or heavily redacted;
-
the efforts at cover-up continue, if
anything more aggressively than before;
-
In addition to the cover-up, there has
been what former 9/11 Commission staffer John Farmer has called
either unprecedented administrative incompetence or organized
mendacity on the part of key figures in Washington.30
These figures include,
They include
also President Clintons National Security Advisor, Samuel Berger,
who prior to testifying on these matters, went to the National
Archives and removed, and presumably destroyed, key relevant
documents.31
In his book, Farmer has in effect endorsed
both of these alternatives.

Farmers first alternative, of unprecedented
administrative incompetence, is in effect the explanation offered by
the

the preceding twenty months during which
important information was withheld from the FBI by key personnel in
the CIAs Bin Laden Unit (the so-called Alec Station)
But thanks to the groundbreaking new book by
Kevin Fenton, Disconnecting the Dots, we can no longer attribute the
anomalous CIA behavior to systemic problems, or what Tony Summers rashly
calls bureaucratic confusion.32
Building on earlier important books by James Bamford, Lawrence Wright, Peter
Lance, and Philip Shenon, Fenton demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt
that there was a systematic CIA pattern of withholding important information
from the FBI, even when the FBI would normally be entitled to it.
Even more brilliantly, he shows that the
withholding pattern has been systematically sustained through four
successive post-9/11 investigations: those of the Congressional Inquiry
chaired by Senators Bob Graham and Richard Shelby (still partly withheld),
the 9/11 Commission, the Department of Justice inspector general, and the
CIA inspector general.
Most importantly of all, he shows that the numerous withholdings, both pre-
and post 9/11, were the work of relatively few people. The withholding of
information from the FBI was principally the work of the so-called Alec
Station group - a group within but not identical with the CIAs
Osama Bin
Laden Unit or Alec Station, consisting largely of CIA personnel, though
including a few FBI as well.
Key figures in this group were CIA officer Tom
Wilshire (discussed in the 9/11 Commission Report as John), and his
immediate superior at Alec Station, Richard Blee.
The post-9/11 cover-up of Wilshires behavior was principally the work of
one person, Barbara Grewe, who worked first on the Justice Department
Inspector Generals investigation of Wilshires behavior, then was
transferred to two successive positions with the 9/11 Commissions staff,
where, under the leadership of Executive Director Philip Zelikow, she was
able to transfer the focus of investigative attention from the performance
of the CIA to that of the FBI.33
Whether or not Grewe conducted the interviews of
Wilshire and other relevant personnel, she,
certainly drew on them when
drafting her sections of the Commissions and Justice Department inspector
generals reports.34
Grewes repositioning from post to post is a sign of an intended cover-up at
a higher level.
So, as we shall see, is Wilshires transfer in May 2001 from
CIAs Alec Station (the Osama Bin Laden Unit) to the FBI, where he began a
new phase of interference with the normal flow of intelligence, obstructing
the FBI from within it.35
The pattern begins with intelligence obtained from surveillance of an
important al Qaeda summit meeting of January 2000 in Malaysia, perhaps the
only such summit before 9/11. The meeting drew instant and high-level US
attention because of indirect links to a support element (a key telephone in
Yemen used by al Qaeda) suspected of acting as a communications center in
the 1998 bombings of US Embassies.
As Fenton notes,
The CIA realized that the summit was so
important that information about it was briefed to CIA and FBI leaders
[Louis Freeh and Dale Watson], National Security Adviser Samuel Berger
and other top officials.36
Yet inside Alec Station Tom Wilshire and his CIA
subordinate (known only as Michelle) 37 blocked the effort of
an FBI agent detailed there (Doug Miller) to notify the FBI that one of the
participants (Khalid Al-Mihdhar) had a US visa in his passport.38
Worse, Michelle then sent a cable to other CIA
stations falsely stating that Al-Mihdhars,
travel documents, including a multiple
entry US visa, had been copied and passed to the FBI for further
investigation.39
Alec Station also failed to watchlist the
participants in the meeting, as was called for by CIA guidelines.40
This was just the beginning of a systematic, sometimes lying pattern, where
NSA and CIA information about Al-Mihdhar and his traveling companion, Nawaf
al-Hazmi, was systematically withheld from the FBI, lied about, or
manipulated or distorted in such a way as to inhibit an FBI investigation of
the two Saudis and their associates.
This is a major component of the 9/11 story;
because the behavior of these two would-be hijackers was so unprofessional
that, without this CIA protection provided by the Alec Station Group, they
would almost certainly have been detected and detained or deported, long
before they prepared to board Flight 77 in Washington.41
Fenton concludes with a list of thirty-five different occasions where the
two alleged hijackers were protected in this fashion, from January 2000 to
about September 5, 2001, less than a week before the hijackings. In his
analysis, the incidents fall into two main groups.
The motive he attributes to the earlier ones,
such as the blocking of Doug Millers cable, was,
to cover a CIA operation that was already
in progress.43
However after the system was blinking red in
the summer of 2001, and the CIA expected an imminent attack, Fenton can see
no other plausible explanation than that,
the purpose of withholding the information
had become to allow the attacks to go forward.44
Wilshires pattern of interference changed
markedly after his move to the Bureau. When in CIA he had moved to block
transmittal of intelligence to the FBI.
Now, in contrast, he initiated FBI reviews of
the same material, but in such a way that the reviews were conducted in too
leisurely a fashion to bear fruit before 9/11. Fenton suspects that Wilshire
anticipated a future review of his files; and was laying a false trail of
documentation to neutralize his embarrassing earlier performance.45
I believe we must now accept Fentons finding of fact:
It is clear that this information was not
withheld through a series of bizarre accidents, but intentionally.46
However, I suggest a different explanation as to
what those intentions originally were, one which is superficially much
simpler, more benign, and also more explicative of other parts, apparently
unrelated, of the 9/11 mystery.
The Liaison Agreements
with Other Intelligence Agencies
Initially, I believe, Al-Mihdhar and Al-Hazmi may have been protected
because they had been sent to America by the Saudi GID intelligence service,
which would explain why after their arrival they were apparently bankrolled
indirectly by the Saudi embassy in Washington.
The facts are well summarized by Paul Church in
Asia Times Online (February 11, 2012):
[B]etween 1998 and 2002, up to US$73,000 in
cashier cheques was funneled by [Saudi Ambassador Prince] Bandar's wife
Haifa - who once described the elder Bushes as like "my mother and
father" - to two Californian families known to have bankrolled al-Midhar
and al-Hazmi
Princess Haifa sent regular monthly payments of between
$2,000 and $3,500 to Majeda Dweikat, wife of Osama Basnan, believed by
various investigators to be a spy for the Saudi government.
Many of the cheques were signed over to
Manal Bajadr, wife of Omar al-Bayoumi, himself suspected of covertly
working for the kingdom. The Basnans, the al-Bayoumis and the two 9/11
hijackers once shared the same apartment block in San Diego.
It was al-Bayoumi
who greeted the killers when they first arrived in America, and provided
them, among other assistance, with an apartment and social security
cards. He even helped the men enroll at flight schools in Florida.47
If the two Saudis were in fact sent by the GID,
they would almost certainly have been admitted to the U.S. under the terms
of the liaison agreement between the GID and the CIA.48
Prince Turki al-Faisal, former head of the GID,
has said that he shared his al Qaeda information with the CIA, and that in
1997 the Saudis,
established a joint intelligence committee
with the United States to share information on terrorism in general and
on
al Qaeda in particular.49
The 9/11 Commission Report adds that after a
post-millennium review, the Counterterrorism Center (which included Alec
Station, the Bin Laden Unit) intended to proceed with its plan of half a
year earlier,
building up the capabilities of foreign
security services that provided intelligence via liaison.50
This was a Blee specialty.
Steve Coll reports that Richard Blee and his
superior Cofer Black, excited about the opportunities presented by liaison
arrangements for expanding the scope of CIA reach in critical regions, had
flown together into Tashkent in 1999, and negotiated a new liaison agreement
with Uzbekistan.51
According to Coll and the Washington Post, this
arrangement soon led, via Tashkent, to a CIA liaison inside Afghanistan with
the Northern Alliance.52
Thomas Ricks and Susan Glasser reported in the
Washington Post that, beginning after the embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam
and Nairobi in 1998,
The United States and Uzbekistan have
quietly conducted joint covert operations aimed at countering
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime and its terrorist allies
, according
to officials from both nations."53

Speaking as a former junior diplomat, let me
observe that a liaison arrangement would probably have required special
access clearances for those privy to the arrangement and sharing the liaison
information.54
This would explain the exclusion of the FBI
agents who were not cleared for this information, as well as the behavior of
other non-cleared CIA agents who proceeded to collect and disseminate
information about the two alleged hijackers.
Alec Station needed both to
protect the double identity of the two Saudis, and to make sure that they
were not embarrassingly detained by the FBI.
Almost certainly the CIA had relevant liaison arrangements, not just with
the Saudi GID and Uzbekistan, but also with the Inter-Services Intelligence
(ISI) of Pakistan, as well as the intelligence services of Egypt, and
perhaps Yemen and Morocco. In particular there is reason to think that Ali
Mohamed, a double agent who was protected by the FBI from being detained in
Canada, thus allowing him to help organize the al Qaeda embassy bombings of
1998, was permitted under such arrangements to enter the US as an agent of
foreign intelligence, probably Egyptian.55
Ali Mohamed figures both in the content and as
source of the Presidents Daily Brief (PDB) of August 6, 2001, in which the
CIA warned the president,
Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US.56
According to Mohameds FBI handler, Jack Cloonan,
all that information came from Ali, while
the PDB itself attributes its key finding to what an Egyptian Islamic
Jihad (EIJ) operative told an [---] service.57 (Ali Mohamed
was definitely EIJ, and this service was probably Egyptian.)
Ali Mohamed
But when Mohamed, like Al-Mihdhar and Al-Hazmi,
was inappropriately admitted to the US, it was reportedly not by the CIA,
but possibly by some other Federal agency.58
This was very possibly a Pentagon agency,
because from 1987 to 1989, Ali Mohamed was assigned to the U.S. [Army]
Special Operations Command [SOCOM] in Fort Bragg, the home of the Green
Berets and the Delta Force, the elite counterterrorism squad.59
SOCOM, which includes JSOC (the Joint Special
Operations Command), has its own intelligence division;60 and
SOCOM is the command that first mounted the Able Danger program in 1999 to
track al Qaeda operatives, and then, inexplicably, both shut it down before
9/11 and destroyed its database.61
In addition SOCOM was working in Uzbekistan with
CIA operatives as a result of the liaison agreement negotiated by Cofer
Black and Richard Blee of the CTC.
Cofer Black
For this and other reasons, I suggest
reconceptualizing what Fenton calls the anomalous Alec Station group as an
inter-agency liaison team (or teams) with special access clearances,
including Alec Station personnel, collaborating personnel in the FBI, and
possibly SOCOM.
(One of these collaborators was FBI agent Dina
Corsi, who according to Fenton withheld vital information from fellow agent
Steve Bongardt even after the NSA had cleared it for him.)62
Background - the
Safari Club and William Casey
These arrangements can be traced in one form or another, at least back to
the 1970s.
Then senior CIA officers and ex-officers
(notably Richard Helms), who were dissatisfied with the CIA cutbacks
instituted under Jimmy Carters CIA director, Stansfield Turner, organized
an alternative network, the so-called Safari Club.
Subordinated to intelligence chiefs from France,
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and (under the Shah) Iran, the Safari Club
provided a home to CIA officers like Theodore Shackley and Thomas Clines,
who had been marginalized or fired by CIA Director Turner.
As Prince Turki later explained, the purpose of
the Safari Club was not just to exchange information, but to conduct covert
operations that the CIA could no longer carry out directly in the wake of
the Watergate scandal and subsequent reforms.63
In the 1980s, CIA Director William Casey made key decisions in the conduct
of the Afghan covert war, not through his own CIA bureaucracy but with the
Saudi intelligence chiefs, first Kamal Adham and then Prince Turki. Among
these decisions was the creation of a foreign legion to assist the Afghan
mujahideen in their war against the Soviets - in other words, the creation
of that support network which, since the end of that war, we have known as
Al Qaeda.64
Casey worked out the details with the two Saudi
intelligence chiefs, and also with the head of the
Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI), the Saudi-Pakistani bank in which Adham and
Turki were both shareholders.
In so doing, Casey was in effect running a second or back-channel CIA,
building up the future al Qaeda in Pakistan with the Saudis, even though the
official CIA hierarchy underneath him in Langley rightly thought this
unwise.65
In American War Machine, I situated
the Safari
Club and BCCI in a succession of second CIA or alternative CIA
arrangements dating back to the creation of the Office of Policy
Coordination (OPC) in 1948.
Thus it is relevant that CIA Director George
Tenet, following Caseys precedent, met with Saudi Ambassador Bandar around
once a month, and would not tell CIA officers handling Saudi issues what he
had discussed.66
Fenton himself invokes the example of the Safari Club in proposing the
possible explanation that Blee and Wilshire used a parallel network to
track Al-Mihdhar and Al-Hazmi inside the United States.
In his words,
Withholding the information about Almihdhar
and Alhazmi only makes sense if the CIA was monitoring the two men in
the US itself, either officially or off the books.67
But a third option would be that the GID was
monitoring their movements, a situation quite compatible with Saudi Prince
Bandars claim that Saudi security had been actively following the
movements of most of the terrorists with precision.68
Joseph and Susan Trento heard from a former CIA officer, once based in Saudi
Arabia, that Both Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi agents.69
If so, they were clearly double agents, acting
(or posing) as terrorists at the same time they were acting (or posing) as
informants. In espionage, double agents are prized and often valuable; but
to rely on them (as the example of Ali Mohamed illustrates) can also be
dangerous.
This was particularly the case for the CIA with respect to Saudi Arabia,
whose GID supported Al Qaeda energetically in countries like Bosnia, in
exchange for a pledge (negotiated by Saudi Interior Minister Naif bin Abdul
Aziz with Osama bin Laden) that Al Qaeda,
would not interfere with the politics of
Saudi Arabia or any Arab country.70
Pakistans ISI was even more actively engaged
with al Qaeda, and some elements of ISI were probably closer to the
ideological goals of al Qaeda, than to Pakistans nominally secular
government.
But in all cases the handling of illegal informants is not just dangerous
and unpredictable, but corrupting. To act their parts, the informants must
break the law; and their handlers, knowing this, must protect them by
failing to report them, and then, all too often, intercede to prevent their
arrest by others. In this way, handlers, over and over again, become
complicit in the crimes of their informants.71
Even in the best of circumstances, decisions have to be made whether to
allow an informants crime to go forward, or to thwart it and risk
terminating the usefulness of the informant. In such moments, agencies are
all too likely to make the choice that is not in the public interest.
A very relevant example is the first World Trade Center bombing of 1993 -
relevant because Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of 9/11, was
one of the 1993 plotters as well. The FBI had an informant, Emad Salem,
among the 1993 plotters; and Salem later claimed, with supporting evidence
from tapes of his FBI debriefings, that the FBI deliberately chose not to
shut down the plot.
Here is Ralph Blumenthals careful account in
the New York Times of this precursor to the mystery of 9/11:
Law-enforcement officials [i.e. the FBI]
were told that terrorists were building a bomb that was eventually used
to blow up the World Trade Center, and they planned to thwart the
plotters by secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, an
informer said after the blast.
The informer was to have helped the plotters build the bomb and supply
the fake powder, but the plan was called off by an F.B.I. supervisor who
had other ideas about how the informer, Emad A. Salem, should be used,
the informer said.
The account, which is given in the transcript of hundreds of hours of
tape recordings Mr. Salem secretly made of his talks with
law-enforcement agents, portrays the authorities as in a far better
position than previously known to foil the Feb. 26 bombing of New York
City's tallest towers.
The explosion left six people dead, more
than 1,000 injured and damages in excess of half a billion dollars. Four
men are now on trial in Manhattan Federal Court in that attack.72
What makes the 1993 plot even more relevant is
that Salem, according to many sources, was an agent of the Egyptian
intelligence service, sent to America to spy on the actions of the Egyptian
Blind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman.73
This raises the possibility that the F.B.I.
supervisor who had other ideas about how to use Emad Salem, was a member
of a liaison team, with special knowledge he could not share with other FBI
agents. It may have been, for example, that the Egyptian intelligence
service declined to let Salems cover be blown.
This suggestion is both
speculative and problematic, but it has the advantage of offering a
relatively coherent explanation for otherwise baffling behavior.
This explanation does not at all rule out the possibility that some
officials had more sinister motives for allowing the bombing to take place
and covering it up afterwards. Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman was at this very
time a key figure in a sensitive Saudi program, signed on to by U.S.
officials as well, to supply mujahideen warriors in Bosnia against Serbia
(including some, like Ayman al-Zawahiri, who were later accused of the 9/11
plot).74
It is clear from both investigative and
prosecutorial behavior that a number of different US agencies did not want
to disturb Rahmans activities. Even after Rahman himself was finally
indicted in the 1995 conspiracy case to blow up New York landmarks, the US
Government continued to protect Ali Mohamed, a key figure in the conspiracy.
Worse, the performance of the FBI in allowing the bombing to proceed was
only one of a series of interrelated bungled performances and missed
opportunities, climaxing with 9/11.
The first was in connection with the murder in
New York of the Jewish extremist Meir Kahane.
The FBI and NY police actually
detained two of the murderers in that case and then released them, allowing
them to take part in the WTC bombing of 1993. A key trainer of the two men
was Ali Mohamed while still in U.S. Special Forces, whose name was
systematically protected from disclosure by the prosecuting attorney,
Patrick Fitzgerald.
Then in 1994, when Ali Mohamed was detained in
Vancouver by the Canadian RCMP, the FBI intervened to arrange for his
release. This freed Mohamed to proceed to Kenya, where he became the lead
organizer of the 1998 US Embassy bombing in Nairobi.75
Ali Mohamed was finally detained by the Americans in 1998, but still not
imprisoned. He was apparently still a free man when he readily confessed to
his FBI handler, Jack Cloonan, that he not only knew at least three of the
9/11 alleged hijackers, but had helped instruct them in how to hijack
airplanes.76
According to Ali Soufan, released in September
2011, Ali Mohamed was still awaiting sentencing in 2011, twelve years after
his guilty plea in May 1999.77
We have to conclude that there is something profoundly dysfunctional going
on here, and has been going on since before 9/11, indeed under both
political parties. The conditions of secrecy created by special clearances
have not just masked this dysfunctionality; they have, I would argue, helped
create it. The history of espionage demonstrates that secret power, when
operating in the sphere of illegal activities, becomes, time after time,
antithetical to public democratic power.78
The more restricted the group of special
planners with special clearances, the less likely are their decisions to
conform with the dictates of international and domestic law, still less with
common morality and common sense.
Add to these conditions of unwholesome secrecy the fundamentally unhealthy,
indeed corrupt, relationship of U.S. intelligence agencies to those of Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan. This has been profoundly anti-democratic both at home
and in Asia.
The US dependency on Saudi oil has in effect subsidized a
wealth-generated spread of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the world,
while what the 99.9 percent of ordinary Americans pay for oil and gas
generates huge sums, which Saudis then recycle into the financial
institutions of the one tenth of one percent at the pinnacle of Wall Street.
In like manner, Americas fraught relationship with the ISI of Pakistan has
resulted in a dramatic increase in international heroin trafficking by the
two agencies Afghan clients.79
In short the bureaucratic dysfunction we are
talking about in 9/11 is a symptom of a larger dysfunction in Americas
relationship with Saudi Arabia, with Pakistan, and through them with the
rest of the world.
Liaison Agreements and
the Protection of Al-Mihdhar and Al-Hazmi
Even without the suggestive precedent of the 1993 WTC bombing, it is
legitimate to posit that liaison agreements may have inhibited the roundup
of Khalid Al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Al-Hazmi.
Let us consider first Fentons finding of fact:
It is clear that this information [about
the two men] was not withheld through a series of bizarre accidents, but
intentionally.80
This finding I consider rock hard. But we cannot
be so coinfident about his explanation:
that the purpose of withholding the
information had become to allow the attacks to go forward.81
I believe that in fact there are a number of
possibilities about the intention, ranging from the relatively innocent (the
inhibitions deriving from a liaison agreement) to the nefarious.
Before considering these, let us deconstruct the
notion of letting the attacks go forward.
Clearly, if the alleged hijackers were not
detained at the airport gates, people would probably have been killed - but
how many? Recall that in the
Operation Northwoods documents, which envisaged
planning false flag attacks to justify a U.S. military intervention in
Cuba, the Joint Chiefs wrote,
We could develop a Communist Cuban terror
campaign in which We could sink a boatload of Cubans.82
Would the loss of four planeloads of passengers
have been a qualitatively different tragedy?
Of course 9/11 became a much greater tragedy when three of the planes hit
the two Towers and the Pentagon. But it is possible that the liaison minders
of the two Saudis did not imagine that their targets were capable of such a
feat. Recall that their flying lessons, even in a Cessna, were such a fiasco
that the lessons were quickly terminated.
Their instructor told them that flying was
simply not for them.83
Let me suggest that there are three separable ingredients to the 9/11
attacks: the hijackings, the strikes on the buildings, and the astonishing
collapse of the three WTC buildings. It is at least possible that the Alec
Station liaison team, as a group, contemplated only the first stage, without
ever imagining the two stages that ensued.
A minimal, least malign initial explanation for the withholding of
information about two of the alleged hijackers would be the hypothesis I
proposed in the case of Emad Salem - the restricted access created by the
special clearance for a liaison agreement.
But just as in 1993, the secret power created
behind the wall of restrictive clearances may have been exploited for
ulterior purposes. The dangerous situation thus created - of potential
would-be-hijackers being protected from detention at a time of expected
attack - may have inspired some to exploit the resulting conditions of
secrecy as an opportunity to plan an incident to justify war.
One important analogy with the 1964 false Second
Tonkin Gulf Incident that was used to justify attacking North Vietnam is the
same presence of a powerful faction - in 2001 the PNAC clique inside
government - that was bent on unilateral military action.84
One clue to this more sinister intention is that the pattern of withholdings
detailed by Fenton is not restricted exclusively to the two Saudis and their
CIA station handlers. There are a few concatenating withholdings by other
agencies - above all the Able Danger info that was destroyed at SOCOM and
the withholding - apparently
by NSA - of an important relevant intercept,
apparently about the alleged hijackers and Moussaoui.85
If the NSA was withholding information from relevant officials, it would
recall the role of the NSA at the time of the second Tonkin Gulf Incident in
August 1964.
Then the NSA, at a crucial moment, forwarded 15
pieces of SIGINT (signals intelligence) which indicated - falsely - that
there had been a North Vietnamese attack on two US destroyers. At the same
time NSA withheld 107 pieces of SIGINT which indicated - correctly - that no
North Vietnamese attack had occurred.86
NSAs behavior at that time was mirrored at the
CIA: both agencies were aware of a powerful consensus inside the Johnson
administration that had already agreed on provoking North Vietnam, in hopes
of creating an opportunity for military response.87
We know from many accounts of the Bush administration that there was also a
powerful pro-war consensus within it, centered on Cheney, Rumsfeld, and the
so-called cabal of PNAC (the Project for the New American Century) that
before Bushs election had been lobbying vigorously for military action
against Iraq.
We know also that Rumsfelds immediate response to 9/11 was to
propose an attack on Iraq, and that planning for such an attack was indeed
instituted on September 17.88
It is worth considering whether some of those
protecting the alleged hijackers from detention did not share these warlike
ambitions.89
Did Richard Blee Have
an Ulterior Motive for Withholding Information?
Fenton speculates that one of those seeking a pretext for an escalated war
against Al Qaeda may have been Richard Blee. We saw that Blee, with Cofer
Black, negotiated an intelligence-sharing liaison agreement with Uzbekistan.
By 2000
SOCOM had become involved, and,
U.S. Special Forces began to work more
overtly with the Uzbek military on training missions.90
In the course of time the Uzbek liaison
agreement, as we saw, expanded into a subordinate liaison with the Northern
Alliance in Afghanistan.
Blee, meeting with Massoud in October 1999,
agreed to lobby in Washington for more active support for the Northern
Alliance.91
After the USS Cole bombing in Aden in 2000, Blee was pushing to expand the
Uzbek military mission still further into a joint attack force in
conjunction with the Northern Alliance forces of Massoud. There was
considerable objection to this while Clinton was still president, partly on
the grounds that Massoud was fighting Pakistani-backed Taliban forces with
Russian and Iranian support, and partly because he was known to be
supporting his forces by heroin trafficking.92
But in the spring of 2001 a meeting of
department deputies in the new Bush administration revived the plans of Blee
and Black, (supported by Counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke) for
large-scale covert aid to Massoud.93 On September 4, one week
before 9/11, the Bush Cabinet authorized the drafting of a new presidential
directive, NSPD-9, authorizing a covert action program along these lines in
conjunction with Massoud.94
In the new Bush administration Blee was no longer a minority voice, and six
weeks after 9/11 he would be named the new CIA station chief in Kabul.95
Fenton reports that in this capacity Blee became
involved in the rendition of al Qaeda detainees, and suggests that the
motive may have been to obtain, by torture, a false confession (by Ibn
Shaikh al-Libi) to Iraqi involvement with al Qaeda.
This false confession then became part of the
fixing of evidence, and,
formed a key part of Secretary of State
Colin Powells embarrassing presentation to the UN to support the
invasion of Iraq.96
Did SOCOM Have an
Ulterior Motive for Closing Down Able Danger?
What ensued after 9/11 went far beyond Blees program for paramilitary CIA
involvement with the Northern Alliance.
The CIA component in Afghanistan was soon
dwarfed by the forces of SOCOM: George Tenet reported that by late 2001 the
US force in Afghanistan consisted of about 500 fighters, including,
110 CIA
officers, 316 Special Forces personnel, and scores of Joint Special
Operations Command raiders creating havoc behind enemy lines.97
In the Bush administration Stephen Cambone, who earlier had collaborated
with Rumsfeld and Cheney in signing the PNACs statement, Rebuilding
Americas Defenses, became one of the active promoters of using SOCOM
special forces to operate covertly against al Qaeda, not just in
Afghanistan, but anywhere in the world.98
It is possible that anything Blee may have done in Alec Station to prepare
the way for 9/11 was only one part of a larger inter-agency operation, in
which an equivalent role was played by SOCOMs shutting down of the Able
Danger project.
This might help explain a handwritten notation
around 10 PM on 9/11 by Stephen Cambone, then one of Cheneys PNAC
appointees under Rumsfeld in the Pentagon, after a phone call with George
Tenet:
-
AA 77 - 3 indiv[iduals] have been
followed since Millennium & Cole
-
1 guy is assoc[iate] of Cole bomber
-
2 entered US in early July
(2 of 3 pulled aside & interrogated?) 99
The guy here is probably Al-Mihdhar, and the
Cole bomber probably Khallad [or Tawfiq] bin Attash, a major al Qaeda
figure connected not just to the Cole bombing but also to the 1998 embassy
attacks.
One wants to know why Tenet was sharing with a
hawk in the Pentagon information that has apparently never been shared by
anyone outside the CIA since. And is it a coincidence that Cambone, like
Blee, oversaw a program - in this case staffed by SOCOM special operations
personnel - using torture to interrogate detainees in Afghanistan?100
Just as Blee was reportedly a special protégé of George Tenet at CIA, so
Cambone was notorious for his fierce loyalty to first Dick Cheney and later
Donald Rumsfeld in the Pentagon.
It is not known whether he was associated with
the Continuity of Government (COG) planning project where Rumsfeld and
Cheney, among others, prepared for the warrantless surveillance and
detention measures that were (as I have argued elsewhere) implemented
beginning on the morning of 9/11 and continuing to today.101
Nor is it known if he was associated in any way
with Cheneys Counterterrorism Task Force in the Spring of 2001, which has
been alleged to have been a source for the war games, including rogue plane
attacks, which added to the disarray of the US response, on 9/11.102
Deep Events as a
Repeated Pattern of U.S. Engagement in War
I want to conclude with a little historical perspective on the dysfunction
we have been looking at. In a sense 9/11 was unprecedented - the greatest
mass murder ever committed in one day on U.S. soil.
In another sense it represented an example of
the kind of signature event with which we have become only too familiar
since the Kennedy assassination. I have called these events deep events -
events deeply rooted in illegal covert activity in various branches of US
intelligence and with a predictable accompanying pattern of official
cover-ups backed up by amazing media malfunction and dishonest best-selling
books.
Some of these deep events, like the Kennedy
assassination, Tonkin Gulf, and 9/11, should be considered structural deep
events, because of their permanent impact on history.
It is striking that these structural deep events - the JFK assassination,
Tonkin Gulf, and 9/11 - should all have been swiftly followed by Americas
engagement in ill-considered wars. The reverse is also true: all of
Americas significant wars since Korea - Laos, Vietnam, Afghanistan (twice,
once covertly and now overtly), and Iraq - have all been preceded by
structural deep events.
As I wrote in American War Machine, a J-5 Staff
Report of 1963 reported to the Joint Chiefs that,
The engineering of a series of provocations
to justify military intervention is feasible and could be accomplished
with the resources available.
Tonkin Gulf, 9/11, and even the Kennedy
assassination itself can all be seen as events that were indeed
engineered, along the guidelines set out in 1962 in the Joint Chiefs of
Staff proposals for Project Northwoods.
In two recent books I have been slowly persuaded, against my own initial
incredulity, to list more than a dozen significant parallels between the
Kennedy assassination and 9/11.
Thanks to Kevin Fentons brilliant research, I
can list a further analogy.
The CIA files on Lee Harvey Oswald, more or less
dormant for two years, suddenly became hyperactive in the six weeks before
the Kennedy assassination. Fenton has demonstrated a similar burst of
activity in FBI files on the two Saudis in the weeks before 9/11 - a burst
initiated by Tom Wilshire, at a time suspiciously close to when the alleged
hijackers settled on a final date for their attack.
Then in both cases there were also strange
delays, leaving the files open at the time of the deep events.105
The Impact of
9/11 on U.S. and International Law
Throughout this essay we have seen two different and indeed antithetical
levels of U.S. foreign policy at work.
On the surface level of public diplomacy we see
a commitment to international law and the peaceful resolution of
differences. On a deeper level, represented by a long-time Saudi connection
and covert arrangements to control international oil, we see the toleration
and indeed protection of terrorists in fulfillment of both Saudi and
American secret goals.
We should see the actions in 2000-2001 of the
Alec Station group, with respect to the two alleged hijackers al-Mihdhar
and al-Hazmi, in the context of this long-time Saudi connection, as well as
of the secret consensus in 2001 - just as earlier in 1964 - that Americas
oil and security needs (along with those of Israel) required a new American
mobilization for war.
Horrendous as it was, the murder of over 2000 civilians on 9/11 was not the
only major crime of that day.
9/11 also initiated a series of on-going
onslaughts on both international and domestic U.S. law. Law and freedom go
together, and both had been significantly enhanced by the founding documents
of the United States in the 18th Century. The world benefited;
written constitutions soon appeared on every continent; and the Young Europe
movements, inspired by Americas example, began the long difficult process
towards todays European Union.
Starting in 2001, both law and freedom have been progressively eroded.
International comity, which depends on each state not doing to others what
they would not want done to them, has been supplanted, at least for a while,
by U.S. unilateral military engagement without constraint, acting without
fear of retribution.
Drone killings in far corners of the world have
now become routine, causing more than an estimated 2000 Pakistani deaths,
the vast majority of them untargeted civilians, and over 75 percent of them
under President Obama.106
The preemptive war against Iraq, despite being
proven both unwarranted and counterproductive, has been followed by the
preemptive bombing of Libya, and the prospect of still further campaigns
against Syria and Iran.
Writing as a Canadian, let me say that I believe in American exceptionalism,
and that at one time America was truly exceptional in its unprecedented
replacement of authoritarian with limited constitutional government.
Today
America is still exceptional, but for its percentage of citizens who are
incarcerated, for its disparity in wealth and income between rich and poor
(a ratio exceeded among large nations only by China), and for its wanton use
of lethal power abroad.
Only the last of these trends began with 9/11.
But 9/11 itself should be seen as a dialectical
outcome of Americas imperial expansion and simultaneous decay - a process
inevitably afflicting those superstates that amass and retain more power
than is necessary for the orderly management of their own affairs.

Clarke said he assumed that there was a high-level decision in the CIA

have issued such an order, he replied, I would think it would have been

and others would never admit to the truth today even if you

Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 (173-77), even though very heavily
redacted at this point, supplied corroborating information, including a
report that Basnan had once hosted a party for the Blind Sheikh Omar
Abdurrahman, involved in the first World Trade Center bombing of 1993.
48 At first I suspected, as have
others, that the two men were Saudi double agents. Another possibility
is that they were sent as designated targets, to be surveilled by the
Saudis and the Americans separately or together. One of my few
disagreements with Fenton is when he calls al-Mihdhar one of [the
hijackers] most experienced operatives (Fenton, Disconnecting the
Dots, 205). My own impression is that he was either an
inexperienced and incompetent spy, or else someone deliberately exposing
himself to detection, in order to test American responses.

Mohamed was one of the primary sources for the infamous Aug. 6, 2001,
presidential daily brief (PDB) entitled Bin Laden Determined to Strike
in U.S. The PDB, often cited as an example of the CIAs good
performance, is in my opinion more probably another example of the Bin
Laden Unit salting the record in preparation for post-9/11 scrutiny. The
PDB, without naming Ali Mohamed, refers to him no less than three times
as a threat, despite the fact that at the time he was under USG control
awaiting sentence for his role in the 1998 embassy plots. The PDB, in
other words, appears to have been a performance for the record,
analogous to Wilshires performance in the same month of August at the
FBI.

9/11 Commission, [has] said in

that significant questions remain unanswered about
the role of Saudi institutions. Evidence relating to the plausible
involvement of possible Saudi government agents in the September 11th
attacks has never been fully pursued, Mr. Kerrey said (Saudi Arabia

71 Such corruption is predictable
and very widespread. In the notorious cases of Gregory Scarpa and Whitey
Bulger, FBI agents in the New York and Boston offices were accused of
giving their mob informants information that led to the murder of
witnesses and other opponents. Agents in the New York office of the old
Federal Bureau of Narcotics became so implicated in the trafficking of
their informants that the FBN had to be shut down and reorganized.

Times, October 28, 1993, emphasis added. The next day, the Times
published a modest correction: Transcripts of tapes made secretly by an
informant, Emad A. Salem, quote him as saying he warned the Government
that a bomb was being built. But the transcripts do not make clear the
extent to which the Federal authorities knew that the target was the
World Trade Center.

withholding of information at a high level in the US Joint Forces

intelligence unit assigned to watch terrorism against the US] briefing
was Vice Adm. Martin J. Meyer, the deputy commander in chief (DCINC),
USJFCOM
.. But despite the red flags raised during the briefing, Meyer
reportedly told Maj. Gen. Larry Arnold, the commander of the Continental
United States NORAD Region (CONR), and other high-level CONR staffers
two weeks before the 9/11 attacks that their concern about Osama bin
Laden as a possible threat to America was unfounded and that, to repeat,
