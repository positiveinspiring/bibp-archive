Lucis Trust, Alice Bailey, World Goodwill and...
The False Light of the World

Spanish version
Alice Ann Bailey, a leading disciple of the Russian theosophist Madame Helena Blavatsky, formed the Lucifer Trust in 1920. 1922 saw the organizations name changed to Lucis Trust though the advancement of the Luciferian beliefs remained true.
Beliefs that in Blavatskys words:
oppose the materialism of science and every dogmatic theology, especially the Christian, which the Chiefs of the Society regard as particularly pernicious.
Lucis Trust promulgates the work of an "Ascended Master" who was working through Alice Bailey for some 30 years.
The Lucis Trust Publishing Company and their many fronts and organizations worship an "Externalized Hierarchy" of "Ascended Masters," who carry out the work of a Luciferian "master plan" for the establishment of a permanent "Age of Aquarius" ruled by one "Sanat Kumara", the "Lord of the World." This is no ordinary third rate occult organization. Lucis Trust is a powerful institution that enjoys "Consultative Status" with the United Nations, which permits it to have a close working relationship with the U.N., including a seat on the weekly sessions, but most importantly influence with powerful business and national leaders throughout the world. The Lucis Trust is as much a political organization as an occult religious one. Aggressively promoting a globalist ideology, Lucis Trust founded its World Goodwill, which is closely connected to international elitist circles. Authors and participants in its various conferences read like a Whos Who of globalist insiders.
Featured on its website, for example, is the Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, put forth in April 1998 as a companion document to the notorious UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
Signatories to the World Goodwill document:
Helmut Schmidt, former Chancellor of West Germany Malcolm Frasier, former Australian Prime Minister Shimon Perez Robert McNamara Paul Volcke Jimmy Carter Pierre Trudeau among others

Lucis Trust is run through an international board of trustees whose membership is said to have included:
John D. Rockefeller Norman Cousins Robert S. McNamara Thomas Watson, Jr. (IBM, former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow) Henry Clauson, Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, 33rd Degree, Southern District Scottish Rite Henry Kissinger
John D. Rockefeller
Norman Cousins

This would then tie Baileys influential occult organization into the international conspiracy of elitists, including the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Bilderbergs, and the Trilateral Commission. Ive been able to confirm some of these connections through Lucis Trusts involvement in the Windsor International Bank and Trust Company, where on its site, the Windsor Bank plainly states that its a Member of, Advisor to, Affiliate of, Friend of, Benefactor of, or Contributor to, the following Organizations, to name several:

IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT
After I posted this discovery, the Windsor Bank promptly changed their page and deleted all traces of the connections which I exposed above.
As of this writing they no longer have a web presence. Ive been able to salvage a copy thanks to Googles Cache - of the page as it appeared when I wrote this Lucis Trust expose: Here is the original. One disturbing aspect is the blatant targeting of children. Lucis Trust directs an activity called Triangles in Education, which is partnered with groups that "make some contribution to the task of laying the foundations for the new education." This, according to Bailey, is part of the overall work of the New Group of World Servers, "a band of obedient workers and servers of the WORD."
The word being the teachings of her channeled Master Djwhal Khul, through her voluminous occult works. The word, has also been heeded by the likes of Robert Muller - former assistant Secretary General of the United Nations and winner of the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education in 1989 for his World Core Curriculum.
He said,
"The underlying philosophy upon which The Robert Muller School is based will be found in the teaching set forth in the books of Alice A. Bailey by the Tibetan teacher, Djwhal Khul."
THE OVERSHADOWING
Alice Bailey was born on June 16th, 1880 in the city of Manchester, England.
She was raised in an orthodox christian family which she would say later, made her very unhappy and a bad tempered little girl. "Life was not worth living," she said, and the feeling of worthlessness, and a certain amount of curiosity about life and death led her to attempt suicide three times before she was even fifteen. At the age of fifteen her first mystical encounter occurred while her family had gone to church. While she was in a room reading, a man wearing a turban on his head suddenly entered her room.
Startled, and not being able to say a word - an obvious out of place character in 19th century Manchester - this stranger spoke to her:
He told me there was some work that it was planned that I could do in the world but that it would entail changing my disposition considerably; I would have to give up being such an unpleasant little girl and must try to get some measure of self-control. My future usefulness to Him and to the world was dependant on how I handled myself and the changes I could manage to make. He said that if I could achieve real self-control I could then be trusted and that I would travel all over the world and visit many countries, "doing your Masters work all the time"... He added that He would be in touch with me at intervals of seven years apart. Alice Bailey - The Unfinished Autobiography, 1951, Lucis Trust

Alice Bailey - The Unfinished Autobiography, 1951, Lucis Trust
This was to be Alice Baileys first contact with her Master Koot Humi.
These contacts with "Secret Chiefs"; "Familiar Spirits"; "Angels"; and "Ascended Masters" is a common theme in the annals of history and has been the origin of many religious, prophetic and occult movements throughout the centuries.
Zoroaster, Mohammed, John Dee, Francis Bacon, Aleister Crowley, Helena Blavatsky, Joseph Smith, Edgar Cayce and Benjamin Creme immediately come to mind. In 1917, after the breakup of her first marriage she moved to the United States, where she was introduced to the teachings of Theosophy. It was during this period that she had met, and married, her husband Foster Bailey (33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason).
She turned out to be a good pupil, Bailey soon rose through the ranks and became the editor of the American Theosophists newspaper.
For the last 125 years, New Age leaders worldwide have followed the false light of Theosophy; they now whisper sweet lies into the itching ears of the powerful - politicians, media moguls, UN officials, foundation grant makers, and Anglican bishops. As the West moves into a post-Christian era, the influence of the New Age movement grows. Penn Lee - A Comprehensive Expose of The New Age Movement

Penn Lee - A Comprehensive Expose of The New Age Movement
The encounter with her fated second "Master" - and soon to be writing partner for an international esoteric movement - occurred in 1919, while having a quiet time on a hill close to her house.
She heard a note of music sounding everywhere which was followed by a voice (Djwhal Khul) that asked her if she was willing to write some books. Having refused, saying that she wouldnt engage in any psychic practices, the voice gave her three weeks to reconsider.
Alice completely forgot about the subject when the voice made its appearance as scheduled.
Agreeing to give it a try for a few weeks the first chapters of Initiation, Human and Solar were written. After about a month, Alice got scared; refusing to do anymore work the Master Djwhal Khul told her to discuss it with her Master Koot Humi. Koot Humi confessed that it was, in fact, him that told DK to contact her and he gave Alice permission to proceed - after giving Mrs. Bailey the proper technique for enhanced telepathic communication. Between 1919 and 1949 (her death), she produced twenty-four books, including an autobiography, nineteen of these books were supposedly written by her Tibetan Master DK (Djwhal Khul). During the intervening years, Alice Bailey spent most of it working out what she referred to as, "The Plan."
The results of which, birthed and influenced many New Age groups:

We havent even scratched the surface yet on the influence of Bailey and her Masters teachings.
Lets look at a comparison by two writers who talk about Lucis Trusts World Goodwill, which when compared, illustrate both sides of Lucis agenda; the manipulation of politics towards a New World Order, and the manipulation through occult means to manifest the "Plan" of the "Hierarchy".

World Goodwill, in its newsletter of 1986, No. 2, listed a number of groups that have participated in its World Service Forum.

Increasingly, powerful deep pocket NGOs, which are neither elected nor accountable, are received as the voice of "civil society." Those NGOs, which the United Nations selectively elevates to "consultative status," are called upon by ECOSOC as advisors representative of civil society. Both World Goodwill and Lucis Trust are engaged in Earth Charter advocacy. World Goodwills spirituality is patently pagan. The following declaration is taken from their promotional material. "During both the full moon and new moon periods there is there is a similar emphasis on the work of energy distribution in meditation .... we consciously align with the rhythmic pattern of energy flow each month, we become a part of a planetary meditative process carried forward at all levels of consciousness and with great creative potential for anchoring the seeds of the coming the coming civilization and the germ of the new culture." If World Goodwill so unblushingly advocates neo-pagan meditative practices, its overt promotion of an occult "plan" for the governing of the universe is nothing short of chilling: "There is an inner government of the planet known under such different names as the spiritual Hierarchy, the society of Illumined Minds, or Christ and his Church, according to various religious traditions. Humanity is never left without spiritual guidance or direction under the Plan... The widespread expectation that we approach the "age of Maitreya," as it is known in the East, when the World Teacher and present head of the spiritual Hierarchy, the Christ, will reappear among humanity to sound the keynote of the new age.... There are millions of mentally alert men and women in all parts of the world who are on rapport with the Plan and work to give it expression. They are people in whom the consciousness of humanity as one interdependent unit is alive and active... These beliefs give a new dimension to spiritual reality... They provide opportunity for cooperation with the spiritual evolution of humanity... there is no group so likely to ensure that humanity achieves this most difficult goal as the men and women of goodwill... requiring only courage... to initiate action to prepare for the New World Order."

World Goodwill is a non-governmental organization (NGO) accredited with the United Nations while its parent, Lucis Trust, enjoys the prestigious "consultative status" afforded those non-governmental organizations on the roster of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Increasingly, powerful deep pocket NGOs, which are neither elected nor accountable, are received as the voice of "civil society."
Those NGOs, which the United Nations selectively elevates to "consultative status," are called upon by ECOSOC as advisors representative of civil society. Both World Goodwill and Lucis Trust are engaged in Earth Charter advocacy. World Goodwills spirituality is patently pagan.
The following declaration is taken from their promotional material.
"During both the full moon and new moon periods there is there is a similar emphasis on the work of energy distribution in meditation .... we consciously align with the rhythmic pattern of energy flow each month, we become a part of a planetary meditative process carried forward at all levels of consciousness and with great creative potential for anchoring the seeds of the coming the coming civilization and the germ of the new culture."
If World Goodwill so unblushingly advocates neo-pagan meditative practices, its overt promotion of an occult "plan" for the governing of the universe is nothing short of chilling:
"There is an inner government of the planet known under such different names as the spiritual Hierarchy, the society of Illumined Minds, or Christ and his Church, according to various religious traditions.

In considering the above information one cant help but wonder whether these organizations, which are aligned with Lucis Trust, believe in the "Plan", as World Goodwill put it,
"to initiate action to prepare for the new world order."
I believe that they do, and it is my intention to prove that conviction throughout this site.
And specifically, that it is a spiritual plan - a plan that, if giving a thorough evaluation from their own writings, can be seen as nothing less than satans attempt to implement a totalitarian demonic throne upon the earth, and humanitys forced worship through Luciferic Rites.
For,
"when the Great One appears," Master Djwhal Khul said through Alice Bailey, "he will take the Mysteries Religion preserved by Freemasonry and make them public."
Lucis Trust has truly become a powerhouse for the New Age ideal; the transformation of society by, and through, occult initiatory means. The respect that Baileys teachings receive, and the reverence for her Master, is without equal.
She has successfully pulled the wool over the eyes of many concerning the true meaning and source of her teachings.
What exactly is the teaching and message delivered by her Master?
This will be the subject examined in part two below.
Once the key to Genesis is in our hands it is the scientific and symbolic Kabbala which unveils the secret. The Great Serpent of the Garden of Eden and the "Lord God" are identical... Stand in awe of him, and sin not, speak his name with trembling... It is Satan who is the god of our planet and the only god... When the Church, therefore, curses Satan, it curses the cosmic reflection of God... In this case it is but natural... to view Satan, the Serpent of Genesis as the real creator and benefactor, the Father of Spiritual mankind. For it is he who was the "Harbinger of Light," bright radiant Lucifer, who opened the eyes of automaton (Adam) created by Jehovah, as alleged; and he who was first to whisper, "In the day yea eat there of, ye shall be as Elohim, knowing good and evil" - can only be regarded in the light of a Saviour. An "adversary" to Jehovah... he still remains in esoteric truth the ever loving "Messenger"... who conferred on us spiritual instead of physical immortality... Satan, or Lucifer, represents the active... "Centrifugal Energy of the Universe" in a cosmic sense... Fitly is he... and his adherents... consigned to the "sea of fire," because it is the Sun... the fount of life in our system, where they are petrified... and churned up to re-arrange them for another life; that Sun which, as the origin of the active principle of our Earth, is at once the Home and the Source of the Mundane Satan...

Alice Bailey & Master Djwhal Khul
A Satanic Communion
2001 (Last Update: May 7th, 2005)
Preparation too must be given to the developing of higher psychic powers... Hospitals and schools will appear under the direct guidance of the Masters; Teachers... will train the minds of the pupils to be responsive to direct inspiration from above.
- The Externalization of the Hierarchy p.516
As we have seen in part one above, Lucis Trust is, today, intimately connected with Elite Politics through its World Goodwill.
We havent yet, however, examined the occult teachings of Bailey as they were related by her Master Djwhal Khul. Her 24 books, combined with the Beacon magazine, Triangles, and the Arcane School indoctrinate students into what Bailey describes as the "Ageless Wisdom" teachings.
The Arcane School, founded in 1922, boasted 20,000 graduates by 1954. This occult university is more active than ever and continues to be the main training ground for New Age disciples. The bulk of these occult teachings, in Baileys books, are from her channeled Tibetan master Djwhal Khul (DK): the "Plan" according to the Hierarchy of Ascended Masters.
Through a series of group-initiations and group-meditative techniques the Hierarchy directs the "New Group of World Servers" to implement a "New World Religion" of which humanity as a whole can aid the "will of the planetary logos".
"Emphasis should be laid on the evolution of humanity," so says Master DK through Bailey, "with particular attention to its goal, perfection." (The Externalization of the Hierarchy p. 515)
"Emphasis should be laid on the evolution of humanity," so says Master DK through Bailey, "with particular attention to its goal, perfection."
(The Externalization of the Hierarchy p. 515)
The objective is,
"the helping of the Great Ones and the rendering to Them of that intelligent assistance which will make Their plans for humanity materialize." (ibid. 516)
"the helping of the Great Ones and the rendering to Them of that intelligent assistance which will make Their plans for humanity materialize."
(ibid. 516)
One way to "materialize" the Hierarchys plan for humanity is through Lucis Trusts Triangle networks.
Their goal is the practice of occult meditation,
"the science of energy flow and energy relationships."
Lucis Trust states that,
"occult meditation is a means of consciously and purposefully directing energy from a recognized source to the creation of some specific effect."
International participants,
"sit quietly for a few minutes and link mentally with other members of their triangle, or triangles. They invoke the energies of light and goodwill, visualizing theses energies as circulating through the three focal points of each triangle and pouring through the networks of triangles surrounding the planet. At the same time they repeat the Great Invocation."
Her 30 year telepathic connection to Master DK was what some would un-hesitantly call demonic possession.
Her husband Foster Bailey said,
"During the long course of the work the minds of the Tibetan and A.A.B [Alice Ann Bailey] became so closely attuned that they were in effect - so far as much of the production of the teaching was concerned - a joint single projecting mechanism." (The introduction to Cosmic Fire)
"During the long course of the work the minds of the Tibetan and A.A.B [Alice Ann Bailey] became so closely attuned that they were in effect - so far as much of the production of the teaching was concerned - a joint single projecting mechanism."
(The introduction to Cosmic Fire)
The technique is called in the occult the "overshadowing" - a euphemism for demonic possession, or as Bailey liked to call it "the science of impression".
Moreover, the Hierarchy has "overshadowed" many in the intervening years up to the close of the century - the growing modern practice of channeling and psychic astral projection bears out this prediction of a half century ago:
These methods of overshadowing will largely be the ones used by the Great Lord and his Masters at the end of the century, and for this reason They are sending into incarnation, in every country, disciples who have the opportunity offered them to respond to the need of training men and woman to recognize the higher psychism, and the true inspiration and mediumship, and to do this scientifically. In fifty years time, the need for true psychics and conscious mediums will be very great if the Masters plans are to be carried through to fruition, and the movement must be set on foot in preparation for the coming of Him for Whom all nations wait. - A Treaty on Cosmic Fire, pp. 757-758

Ten Seed Groups
In The Externalization of the Hierarchy, Master DK informed Bailey of the Hierarchys plan for "The Ten Seed-Groups" (p.90).
These seed-groups were to infiltrate all sectors of society, and be "esoterically anchored" with "new approaches to divinity." I have no doubt that todays New Age Movement is the result of the Hierarchys "scattering of the seed", as Bailey put it, and that todays, arguably, open pagan society can largely be traced to this occult "plan".
The Ten Seed Groups were "embryonic, like germinating seed". Through their occult practices these ten groups would work directly "under inspiration from the Hierarchy via the focused minds of the group."
From Alice Baileys Discipleship in the New Age - Volume I, p. 35-40, The Ten Seed-Groups are as follows:
1) Telepathic Communicators Summary of Work - Telepathic communication from soul to soul through: from mind to mind through integration; between humanity and Hierarchy (inner government of the planet) through Science of impression. 2) Trained Observers Summary of Work - Dissipation of world glamour, illusion and maya through illumination. 3) Magnetic Healers Summary of Work - Through "magnetic living". Through laws of life - laws of health and right human relationships. Through continuity of consciousness. 4) Educators in the New Age Summary of Work - Education through inflow of the light of knowledge into "instinctual man". - Through inflow of the light of the wisdom into "intelligent man". Through applied knowledge, expressed wisdom and occult understanding in "spiritual man". 5) Political Organizers Summary of Work - International understanding through communication of the divine (political) Will into races and nations, "linking the department of the Manu (the Ruler of the human race) with men." 6) Workers in the Field of Religion Summary of Work - Through transcendental mysticism. Through transcendental occultism. Through transcendental religion. 7) Scientific Servers Summary of Work - Through development of new hypotheses to substantiate the next step forward.

Truly an occult conspiracy of the highest kind, and worrisome at the very least for anyone - both Christian and non-believers alike.
When you factor in what Ive shown in part one - Lucis Trusts influence over international elite politics - its downright chilling! The most revealing part of the seed-groups is the fact that the political organizers link "the department of the Manu (the Ruler of the human race) with men".
In Frontier Science/Social Change, Paul Von Ward relates,
"Hermetic Principles... comprise part of a body of knowledge allegedly given to humans by an advanced being more than 5,000 years ago. He has been known by various names, including Thoth or Seth in Egypt, Manu in India, Hermes in Greece, and Lucifer or Satan in the Judeo-Christian tradition."

Mantra: a mystical formulation of invocation or incantation
As mentioned before, the Great Invocation is sounded while the Triangle networks of "light workers" meditate to cause the "energy flow" of the Hierarchy to enter and influence humanity.
The present version, giving in 1945 and shown above, was the third installment of a series of Invocations giving to Bailey by Djwhal Khul. According to Lucis Trust,
"The Great Invocation if given widespread distribution, can be to THE NEW WORLD RELIGION what the Lords prayer has been to Christianity."
The wording was intentional, so that Christians would not become suspicious. In Discipleship in the New Age, p.157 we find,
"I [Djwhal Khul] have so worded and rendered the Invocation [so] that the Christian world, through its churches, may not find it impossible to use."
This represents a calculated deception on DKs part.
On pgs. 150 and 156, we learn:
"It can be so presented to the masses everywhere, the general public, will be prompted to take it up and will use it widely... The meaning of this Invocation has been expressed in terms which are understandable, in a measure, to the average person because of its familiar wording, based on many Scriptural terms. But the true inner implications and significances are... not superficially apparent... They mean one thing to the ordinary man...; they mean another thing to the man upon the Probationary Path...; these words mean still another thing to the disciple...; to initiates and to the senior Members of the Hierarchy, they convey a still higher and more inclusive significance."

That is indeed the case, and the actual words used are giving a totally opposite meaning when examined under the light of Biblical Scripture, and compared point for point with Baileys writings (she often quotes scripture - the interpretations of which are giving by her channeled Master).
See Ph.D Robert A Herrmanns web page A Modern Manifestation of Absolute Evil for his paper called A Scientific Analysis of the Writings of Alice A. Bailey and their Applications for a treatment in DKs (Baileys) deception.
For instance:
Light = Luciferian Enlightenment God = Satan stream forth = overshadow love = various forms of Scripturally defined evil or, generally hatred. Christ = Antichrist little wills of men = the claimed unintelligent, weak and inferior desires of individuals; especially those that follow conservative Judeo-Christian doctrine. purpose = to prepare for the appearance of the Antichrist Masters = demons or demon controlled individuals. race of men = "humanity" as ruled by Lucifer plan = complete domination in preparation for and after the appearance of the Antichrist. seal the door where evil dwells = violent, if necessary, eradication of those that follow Judaism, conservative Christianity, some liberal Christianity, and other similar orthodox religions. [note: this is so because of the "separativeness" of these religious views. Djwhal Khul calls this evil, and that it must be eradicated for the Hierarchys plans of the New Age-New World Religion to proceed. In multiple passages DK identifies the Jews and Christians as the spirit of separativeness, i.e., John 14:6, and Exodus 20:3] power = often hideous and actual destructive forces.

The Great Invocation has now been translated into 50 languages and is the mantra of the New Age. It has even received the attention of world dignitaries at the UN where it has been sounded at many official conferences and during the opening ceremonies in 1992 at the UNs Earth Summit in Rio.
During a talk given by Ida Urso at a Lucis Trust Arcane School conference in 1995, the connections between the UN and the Great Invocation were explained:
"It is no coincidence that we are celebrating both the 50th anniversary of the Great Invocation and the United Nations. Both in different ways are pivotal to the Plan... let us together complete the triangle of light... let us contemplate that world body - the hope of humanity - which was conceived just 50 years ago under the impulse of the three spiritual Festivals (falling on March 28th, April 27th and May 26th)... It was on April 25, 1945 two days previous to the full moon of Taurus and the Festival of Wesak [Note: the best time to recite the Great Invocation, according to Lucis Trust, as the energies of the Hierarchy are in alignment with the Earth] that delegates from 50 nations, met in San Francisco for a conference known officially as the United Nations Conference on International Organization... On this period the Tibetan Master tells us: Not for nothing is this conference being held during the five days of the Wesak Full Moon. It will be a time of supreme difficulty, in which the Forces of Light will face... the forces of selfishness and separativeness."

It seems the dreaded UN was a spiritual undertaking in alignment with the luciferic light.
This adds weight to researchers like Reverend Wayne C. Sedlak and his position paper called The United Nations - A Most Sophisticated Coven. Whenever the Invocation is recited, according to Lucis Trusts booklet on the subject, that individual "allies himself with the spiritual Hierarchy," whether he knows it or not.
And in Discipleship, Bailey writes,
"it embodies the divine intent and summarizes the conclusions of the thinking of the planetary Logos."
Luciferic Initiation
Some background is necessary on Chakras and the Kundalini, in order to proceed further with this expose. In Hindu occult practice (the main root of the New Age Movement) there are 7 major centers for kundalini energy. By occult methods using meditation, drugs, visualization, yoga and whatever means necessary, initiates seek to awaken the sleeping fiery serpent (kundalini) for a "higher" state of consciousness. This kundalini energy is visualized as an entwined serpent which rises from the base of the spine to "enlighten" and eventually dissolve the ego - to become a god incarnate, thereby preventing further incarnation on the physical plane.
The New Age disciples believe in reincarnation and are taught by the demonic Hierarchy that this is the only way to stop the endless cycle of Karma - to evolve into Gods...(i.e. Gen. 3:5). That is the goal and the techniques vary, but as one "ascends" through the 7 progressive chakras, each is an initiation unto a higher consciousness, until finally when you reach the point of union with,
"Sanat Kumara" "Shiva" "Vishnu" "Lord of the World",
"Sanat Kumara"
"Shiva"
"Vishnu"
"Lord of the World",
...or what they call the "Christ Consciousness". Satans deception is that through each successive chakra the occult initiate actually does perceive a shift in consciousness, which to him it seems, is a progressive shift. The occultist now feels his contact and psychic telepathy with the Hierarchy getting stronger.
As he continues, the initiate invariably reaches a point of no return. There is no turning back and all those doubts he failed to heed - being the "right" path or not - are finally revealed to him... its too late. Their his!
This is called the Luciferic Initiation. Texe Marrs put it best when he wrote,
"These feelings, voiced by so many who have received a Luciferic Initiation, are significant. They point to two inescapable facts: (1) the initiate recognizes that he is coming into close contact with dark, evil forces, and a spirit of fear engulfs him (2) after the initiation, his mind is patently altered This is what New Agers call the Kundalini or Skaktipat experience, technically termed a Paradigm (World-view) Shift." (Mystery Mark of the New Age, p.39)

Baileys Planetary Logos
For the Greeks the Logos was the divine pattern found in humans. The plural of logic.
The Hebrews had a similar view, which they called Dabar. Dabar was also a representation of a divine pattern, and they thought that it could only be found in certain things. When Baileys teacher and mentor, H.P. Blavatsky, wrote,
"...actually the "Serpent" was the "Lord God" himself, who, as the Ophis, the Logos, or the bearer-of divine creative wisdom, taught mankind to become creators in their turn..." [1]
Baileys own "Planetary Logos" carries on in the Luciferic tradition... she didnt call her organization Lucifer Trust for nothing!
And so it is, Alice Baileys "trinity".
Notice that Lucifer is the Ruler of Humanity. Hes also identified with something called the "planetary throat center."
This is a clue that she is talking about chakras. Lucifer, or rather, luciferic energy is released when the 5th chakra (throat) is awakened.
Notice how Sanat (Satan) Kumara is also identified with the "spiritual pineal gland" and "planetary head center", this would correspond to 7th chakra - chakras are also called "energy centers", so Baileys "Planetary Centers" fits within the chakra teaching, and Bailey calls her Logos "Logoic kundalini." Whats more, each chakra is a Logos unto itself. Bailey says that the "Planetary Logos" is called the First Kumara, "the one Initiator," and "he came to this planet from Venus." [2]
An allusion to Lucifer and his traditional association with Venus (Son of the Morning).
Elsewhere, she writes that "the goal for the planetary Logos is God Consciousness" [3] and that the "illuminating light of the fifth Logos (Lucifer- 5th throat chakra) is felt at the third initiation."[4] And she makes another statement that the "Venus scheme" was "signalized" by the "Venusian planetary Logos on His fifth chain (chakra)". [5] According to Hindu tradition, each chakra center also has its associated color. If you look at the drawing at top-right you can see that the 5th chakra (Lucifer) is given the color blue. Below it is a representation of the throat chakra bathed in its characteristic blue "light." Look familiar? It should!
The Readers Digest full page ad Ive shown above also has a blue glow. In part one I displayed the Lucis Trust logo and it too features this streaming blue light. The New Age Symbol invented by Foster Bailey has a plethora of symbolic imagery.
The symbol, according to Lucis Trust, is,
"set in a limitless field of blue, which signifies the sphere of life expression of our solar logos... superimposed upon the triangle of new age forces is the five pointed star of [Anti]Christ. The Star is blue because it represents as much of the solar quality to which humanity can respond."
You can see this symbol on the front cover of Lucis Trusts Beacon Magazine (bottom-right), which also displays the blue light of the "logos". In Initiation, Human and Solar, Bailey mentions the five-pointed star as the final two initiations and,
"it descends upon him, merges in him, and he is seen at its center."
The five pointed star "blazes forth" and "he enters within the flame." A perfect description of the Luciferic Initiation if there ever was one!
This, she says,
"puts a man in touch with the center in the Body of the Planetary Logos."
What made me realize the significance of Baileys blue symbology was a short snippet, almost written in passing, in an e-mail sent to a list that Im on:
"Blue" is Masonic Blue Lodge for Blue Light eyes of Horus the "Watcher". The United Nations has Blue Flags and Helmets. Blue is for the Occultic "Blue Lips of Death."
It was sent by Pointman (some of you know him), so I knew it was an important part in their secret symbology.
As I started checking into it, I realized he was absolutely right, and I had been working on these Lucis Trust pages at the time, which immediately brought the whole thing into perspective.

The new world order must meet the immediate need and not be an attempt to satisfy some distant, idealistic vision. The new world order must be appropriate to a world which has passed through a destructive crisis and to a humanity which is badly shattered by the experience. The new world order must lay the foundation for a future world order which will be possible only after a time of recovery, of reconstruction, and of rebuilding. In the preparatory period for the new world order there will be a steady and regulated disarmament. It will not be optional. No nation will be permitted to produce and organize any equipment for destructive purposes or to infringe the security of any other nation. The new world order must be appropriate to a world which has passed through a destructive crisis... We are concerned with only one subject, the ushering in of the new world order. ...the present world order (which is today largely disorder) can be so modified and changed that a new world and a new race of men can gradually come into being. Renunciation and the use of the sacrificial will should be the keynote for the interim period after the war (WWII), prior to the inauguration of the New Age. - Alice Bailey: Quotes From Various Works
