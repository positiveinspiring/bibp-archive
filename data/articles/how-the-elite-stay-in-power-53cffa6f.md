# How The Elite Stay In Power

"The race issue based on skin
color is a deeply emotional one among many, that has caused
unimaginable separation and was used very craftily to
position large groups of people against each other.
This is
a wake-up call to all those who believe they are free
because of race or class or wealth.
We have all been denied
freedom and dignity, trapped in a life of servitude to the
banking families and their economic stranglehold on our
planet - no matter what color our skin may be."
