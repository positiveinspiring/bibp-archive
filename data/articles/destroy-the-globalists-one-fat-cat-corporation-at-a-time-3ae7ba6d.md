We've told you who, in "Naming
Names," now it's time to tell you how.
Many may ask,
"How exactly
can we boycott the globalists when they control everything?"
The answer is by systematically boycotting and replacing them with local
alternatives.
You can actually start today, by boycotting corporations you
may not have even considered part of this nefarious agenda and corporations
you not only can certainly live without, but would be better off for it.
It requires absolutely no money at all, in fact,
it will save you money in the long run and if you decide to replace them,
you may learn a valuable skill-set in the process.
Coke Idol and You: What is
wrong with Coke,
is everything that's wrong with America.
The focus will fall first on
Coca-Cola and
Pepsi.
Two very similar corporations which populate
both the
Brookings Institute and the
Council on Foreign Relations,
unelected, extra-legal conglomerations that conspire and contrive world
policy, world wars, and the means to implement them for the sole benefit of
its corporate membership, entirely at your expense both in blood and
treasure.
What's Wrong with
Pepsi & Coke?
Conflict of Interest
Pepsi and Coke are both corporate members of the
Brookings Institute, who for example, published "Which Path to Persia?," a
156 page report detailing methods to institute regime change in Iran.
These
methods range from foreign funded color revolutions and covert military
operations, to arming terrorist groups (including
MEK which has killed
Americans) and all out invasion.
Even if you believe Iran represents a clear and present danger,
-
Wouldn't it
be the job of our elected representatives to determine a course of action?
-
Couldn't these "experts" be assembled into a committee under the watchful
eyes of representatives elected by the people, even if they required a
degree of secrecy?
-
How does any functioning democratic society then tolerate
a corporate funded organization comprised of unelected "experts" with
absolutely no oversight and the ability to ultimately steer American policy?
Because, indeed, much of what was written in "Which Path to Persia?" has
already become a reality, without the consent, and in many cases, without
the knowledge of the American people.
Another example comes from the
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), to which
Pepsi and Coke are also both corporate members.
Many of the reports coming
from the CFR end up becoming public policy. Again, unelected businessmen,
bankers, and policy wonks funded by corporate special interests steer
American policy, including the myriad of laws, rules, regulations, and tax
structures that protect megalithic monopolies like Pepsi and Coke.
The "Building a North American Community" report from 2005 spelled out in
detail the
integration of Canada, the United State, and Mexico into a
European Union-style superstate.
Incrementally, and against the will of the
American people, this agenda has been slowly unfolding into what has become
the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP), another cleverly named
stepping-stone to supernationality.
You will find not only Pepsi and Coca-Cola as corporate members of these
clandestine, meddling organizations, you will find their people sitting in
as individual members as well.
Just like JP Morgan during the robber baron
age, these people end up running corporations not for their love of their
trade, railroads and steel for Morgan, in Pepsi and Coke's case, bubbly
beverages, but rather to exploit the immense amount of wealth they produce
with their national and global monopolies.
These corporations rival the size and prosperity of some nation-states.
Collectively, the Fortune 500, through their coordination via organizations
like Brookings and the CFR, comprise a "dark nation" that exists beyond
borders and the typical limitations of the traditional nation-state.
However, technology has made it possible to live without most of these
overgrown corporations, where local businesses can most certainly accomplish
anything they can, sometimes more.
Certainly, however, in the case of beverages we as individuals and as
communities are more than capable of creating, exchanging and enjoying
beverages without any corporation involved at all.
Why then do we insist on
pooling our collective resources in their hands to give us flavored sugar
water? Many would cite regulations and taxation that prohibit us from
producing and selling locally, such regulations born from these immensely
influential corporations in the first place.
This is all the more reason to
boycott them and put them out of business.
Coke: Enjoy (your brain
tumor.) Monsanto says aspartame is safe,
Why would such an 'ethically conscious' corporation like Monsanto lie?
Your Health
Another reason to boycott Pepsi and Coca-Cola in
particular is because everything they sell is horrible for your health.
A look at their product lists shows us a parade
of,
Americans
need not look but past their own waistline to see that they are literally
slow-killing us.
Of course, everyone and anyone is more than
welcome to choose for themselves how they live but if you would like another
reason to boycott these corporations, being better off with your health
without them is certainly a good one.
Pepsi Product Lines
A full list with links to individual product line websites can be found
here.
Don't be fooled. Pepsi Co. doesn't just sell the tooth rotting cola
drink of their namesake, they are also the purveyors of:
Drinks
AMP, Aquafina, Gatorade, Lipton, Starbucks Coffee, Tropicana, and
many more...
Food
Lay's, Doritos, Tositos, Cheetos, Fritos, Sun Chips, everything from
Quaker Oats, Ruffles and many more...
Coca-Cola Product Lines
Frankly, the Coca-Cola list is too long to put on a single page.
You can go
to their website and see for yourself the extensive empire they have built,
including brands that come from around the world. The full list can be
found
here.
Below are only a few examples:
Other brands,
Conclusion
As you can see, almost everything you put in your mouth comes from these two
corporations, and any exception to this most likely is in the form of
another similar globalist conglomerate like Nestle, or bought from the
globalist consumer troughs at Walmart (also
a CFR corporate member.)
The
implications of these two, extraordinary lengthy lists of products that are
found worldwide, gives us a real metric by which to measure the reach and
depth this planet is infested with by corporate interests. It permeates
nearly every aspect of our lives, and many unwitting souls entirely depend
on them, and by doing so, are entirely at their mercy.
You may be tempted to throw your hands up at what seems like a futile task.
But honestly, what your body really needs can always be found locally.
...most
definitely would not only be better for you, but better for society.
If you
understand the gravity of what the above list represents, you must also
understand that no excuse stands for continuing to fund these nefarious,
expansive empires.
Coke and Pepsi and the products they peddle can certainly done without.
Nothing in the above list you require to live.
Even bottled water, in the
long run, is more expensive (economically and socially) than quality water
filtration systems or atmospheric water generators (dehumidifiers with water
filters built-in.)
While ultimately we will need to break our dependence on
corporations like Walmart, Target, and the big oil corporations, etc.,
starting by putting these two giants into their graves and replacing them
with healthy, local alternatives is an excellent start.
Economic and financial expert Max Keiser breaks
down the power of voting with your wallet.
This article was inspired by economic and financial expert Max Keiser who
has for years tried to educate people about the power of smart consuming and
how people can literally change the world one purchase at a time.
This
philosophy is can be applied with a little thought and effort to great
effect.
Buy silver, crash JP Morgan, explained.
Keiser's latest campaign involves buying silver in order to crash globalist
banking giant JP Morgan.
JP Morgan has been issuing paper certificates
representing silver they do not own (counterfeiting). Should people around
the world (and they are) heed Keiser's call and force firms like JP Morgan
to deliver silver they do not hold, they will "crash."
By holding silver, an
alternative form of currency to the globalist fiat dollar, you are also
boycotting and replacing yet another facet of the globalist empire.
We will not dismantle and replace this system overnight, and we cannot do it
individually, but by acting individually toward a life of greater
self-sufficiency and independence we move collectively toward a freer and
more prosperous future.
