On a recent visit to Tucson, where I was invited
to give a presentation on monetary reform, I was disturbed by a story of
strange goings on in the desert. A little over a year ago, it seems, a new
industrial facility sprang up on the edge of town. It was in a remote
industrial zone and appeared to be a bus depot.
The new enterprise was
surrounded by an imposing security fence and bore no outward signs
identifying its services. However, it soon became apparent that the compound
was in the business of outfitting a fleet of prison buses.
Thirty or so
secondhand city buses were being reconfigured with prison bars in the
windows and a coat of fresh paint bearing the Wackenhut G4S logo on the
side.
The new Wackenhut operation is shrouded in mystery.
It has been running its
fleet of empty prison buses night and day, apparently logging miles on a
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contract. Multiple buses can be seen
driving all over town and even on remote desert back roads. Oddly, except
for the driver and one escort guard seated in front, these buses appear to
be empty.
Wackenhut Services was founded by George Wackenhut in 1954 to provide prison
guard services to state and federal governments. Wackenhut Services is now
owned by the Danish corporation
G4S.
Observers originally thought that the
purpose of the new Wackenhut operation was to outfit prison buses to be
distributed in other parts of the country.
But it soon became apparent that
none of the buses was leaving the Tucson depot. Recently, a passerby
observed what appeared to be a training operation there. In what seemed to
be strange activity for 10:30 PM on a Saturday night, the depot yard was
fully illuminated, the entire fleet of buses was up and running, and drivers
and guards were scrambling around the yard.
The question is, what were they
training for?
Wackenhut has never officially announced itself to the community, and the
local news media have never mentioned its presence. Hiring has been
discreetly conducted via the Internet, and an apathetic general public has
taken little notice. Among the few who have noticed, one theory is that the
prison bus depot is simply infrastructure for border security.
But if so,
-
Where are the illegal aliens?
-
Why are these buses always empty?
-
What is the
alleged justification for burning thousands of gallons of diesel fuel to run
thirty decrepit, smoking buses night and day without passengers?
There is another interesting piece to this puzzle.
On the desolate plain
between Phoenix and Tucson is a tiny town called Florence, Arizona, which
features a population consisting largely of prisoners. For decades, Florence
has been the home of two of the largest county and federal prisons in the
state; and in 2007, a vast new DHS prison was built there as well. Like the
Wackenhut buses, this shiny new facility, which literally disappears into
the horizon, has gone unannounced and unnoticed by the general public.
A new
facility for imprisoning illegal aliens? It is hard to imagine such
expensive infrastructure being built for that purpose when U.S. policy has
been to simply return illegals to their home countries.
Fraud and waste aside, this mysterious activity has sinister implications.
Why the obvious secrecy?
Since the
World Trade Center disaster in 2001, the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has grown to monster proportions, claiming a
projected $50 billion of the federal budget in 2009.
DHS includes the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which earned notoriety in 2005
for its gross mishandling of the Katrina disaster in New Orleans.
Al Martin,
a retired naval intelligence officer and former contributor to the
Presidential Council of Economic Advisors, has linked the remilitarization
of FEMA to the civil unrest anticipated along with economic collapse.
He
wrote in a November 2005 newsletter called Behind the Scenes in the
Beltway:
FEMA is being upgraded as a federal agency, and upon passage of PATRIOT Act
III, which contains the amendment to overturn posse comitatus, FEMA will be
re-militarized, which will give the agency military police powers... Why
is all of this being done? Why is the regime moving to a militarized police
state and to a dictatorship?
It is because of what Comptroller General David
Walker said, that after 2009, the ability of the United States to continue
to service its debt becomes questionable.
Although the average citizen may
not understand what that means, when the United States can no longer service
its debt it collapses as an economic entity. We would be an economically
collapsed state. The only way government can function and can maintain
control in an economically collapsed state is through a military
dictatorship. 1

Of course, there may be another, more innocent explanation for all this.
But
anyone living near one of these facilities should be asking to hear it. In
the meantime, the ominous implications would seem to warrant exploring
alternative sources of funding for the federal budget and the federal debt.
There are other ways to deal with the national debt than relying on the
waning appetites of the Chinese and the Japanese for U.S. securities.
Some
innovative possibilities for funding both the federal debt and President Obamas new economic stimulus package will be the subject of future
articles.
