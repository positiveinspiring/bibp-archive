The hypocrisy of the war on drugs is outrageous when compared to the amount
of drug trafficking that benefits
the CIA and
international banking system.
The son of a convicted notorious mobster,
John Gotti Jr, when asked in court if the family still dealt drugs
cracked,
"No, we can't compete with the government."
Today in Afghanistan, American troops have been
seen guarding poppy fields used to make heroin.
Those fields were all but wiped out by 2001 when
the Taliban destroyed them and forbade that agricultural pursuit. Now
they're flourishing again after the American occupation.
This doesn't make sense despite all the mainstream reports that American
troops are protecting the poppy farmers from the bad guys.
Internet sites
such as Prison Planet, Info Wars, The Political Coffeehouse and others
report otherwise. They connect the CIA and US military to restarting the
poppy fields in Afghanistan in 2002, increasing poppy growth by over 650
percent.
Who's telling it like it is?
One way the CIA keeps
their drug trafficking hidden from public view
The CIA's secret operations to influence journalism started in the 1950s by
infiltrating the media and bribing journalists to be operatives and assets
for the CIA.
By 1976, then CIA director William Colby
reportedly bragged that
the CIA owned the press. Supposedly,
this too secret to name operation was coined "Operation Mockingbird" by
Deborah Davis in her book Katherine the Great.
Operation Mockingbird worked well against prize winning
journalist Gary Webb when his newspaper, the San Jose Mercury News,
ran his in depth series on CIA drug trafficking that flooded the USA to help
finance the CIA backed Nicaraguan Contras during the 1980s.
Journalists all over the USA jumped on the series, claiming Webb's
journalism was shoddy. The newspaper had to recant and fire him, and Gary
Webb was black listed from mainstream journalism completely.
Webb retaliated by having his book Dark Alliance published and making
the NY Times best seller list, forcing some of his critics to privately eat
crow after the fact.
Despite the CIA's control of the press, a few Mexico and Central America
cocaine busts of plane cargoes and discoveries of large cocaine stashes on
crashed planes with CIA hired pilots flying them for front companies did hit
the mainstream news, albeit briefly.
Remember the movie "Air
America?" It was based on
an actual CIA owned front company
transporting tons of heroin from Southeast Asia's "Golden Triangle" poppy
fields during and after the Vietnam conflicts.
Now Afghanistan and the "Golden Crescent" are
the featured opium/heroin conduit sources.
Government and big
business using drug traffic profits is nothing new
When the U.S. government made deals with the Cosa Nostra mafia to
help police ports and harbors during WW II, they breathed life into the
heroin trade. Eventually, Marseilles, France was set up by the Corsican
mafia to become the "French Connection" for heroin traffic.
But opium trade history goes back further, to colonial times and early
America. That's when American shipping magnates used their fast Clipper
Ships to compete with England's monarch sanctioned dope running East India
Company for transporting opium to China.
A few key players created family fortunes from the China opium trade that
exist today within some northeast America's "old money" families.
Among the familiar family names, according to Wikipedia (source below) is
Forbes. Another source mentions
Astor, a prominently wealthy philanthropic family around New York
today (Wiki source below).
In those days, trafficking dope was a legitimate
business endeavor, immoral but not illegal. Now it is illegal as
well.
Ironically, this allows the biggest illicit drug
providers to financially benefit the CIA and international banking.
