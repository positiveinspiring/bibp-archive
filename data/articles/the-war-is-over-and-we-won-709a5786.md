The war I'm talking about is the war between
individuals and the state.
You see, governments have already lost. They
just don't know it yet.
There has been a war going on between
collectivizing, coercive government and the allied forces of individualism,
freedom and markets for quite some time. Exactly how long is hard to say
because for most of history it seems that the governed more or less accepted
that they need to be governed and accepted the brutality of politicians,
whether those politicians were tribal chiefs, pharaohs, princes or
presidents.
So there wasn't much of a fight going on between the forces of coercion (the
state) and the forces of cooperation and peace (the market) for the first
few thousand years of human civilization.
But something started to shift in the last few hundred years. Maybe it was
by accident and maybe it's the result of countless fortunate accidents;
scientific discoveries coupled with explorations in philosophy. But humanity
managed to reach an Age of Enlightenment and an Industrial Age.
Standards of living began to rise for the
masses, and people started to realize that being free was much, much better
than being property of the king.
Later, at the end of the 20th
Century, they would also realize that being free was also better than being
property of the collective. Not only was it better for individual happiness
when one was not owned, but it was also better for material progress when a
bunch of free individuals were left alone to use their talent and resources
to satisfy their desire to create and to make a profit.
So it's hard to pinpoint when the war started exactly, though it's almost
certainly within the last few hundred years; and it really picked up steam
with the colonization of North America.
But I can suggest a definite period for the end
of the war.
The End of the War - 1913-1994
The beginning of the end of the war between government and the individual
was 1913.
That was when what would become the biggest,
most powerful, most murderous, most indebted government the world has ever
seen (and likely will ever see, if we're lucky) sowed the seeds of its own
guaranteed collapse.
That was the year the latest incarnation of a US
central bank was created to do what central banks do:
provide the government
with limitless purchasing power stolen from the productive individuals
through currency supply inflation.
The end of the end, so to speak, was in 1994.
That was the year the
Internet gained widespread
public knowledge and use.
Governments have always thrived by,
In other words:
indoctrination, inflation, misinformation, and
propaganda.
The governed vastly outnumber the governors, so force was never
enough to keep control.
Sure you could make an example out of a couple
of the slaves by using violence on them. But to efficiently control a bunch
of humans and use them as tax cows, you have to convince them that they are
better off being tax cows.
After the Internet, it became impossible for the
governed not to find out the truth of their condition.
I understand if when I say that government has lost the war, you might think
I'm crazy. After all, things look pretty bleak. Yes, the government is out
of control in the US and in many other countries.
But their actions are more like death throes.
Like a big, mortally wounded beast, the state is lashing out with the
strength and ferocity that comes from panic. It senses death approaching.
And that may make it temporarily more dangerous.
But the end is in sight. All their actions are actually reactions to fact
that they're losing. They are trying to close the doors, control the flow of
information and restrict the flow of capital, but people are finding ways
around everything (especially people like us and the people who read
publications like this).
The blatantly obvious and rather pathetic attempts at information control
keep coming. Like the
latest in a long string of executive orders signed by
President Obama just before the
recent
State of the Union address.
The order will expand the power of the
Department of Homeland Security to "share" information with private
industry. In other words, it will be easier for the government to gather
information about you from the electronic media you use.
And of course, there is the much-talked about "Internet
kill switch" that Obama and his fellow heads of state are dying
to make a reality.
Even if the various states all over the world manage to find a way to shut
off the Internet, they'll find out who really won if they do shut the
Internet down. The entire world is online now. And they all love it.
Imagine if we had no email, no Facebook, no
Craigslist, and that our smartphones just became plain cell phones again...
I make no exaggeration when I say that there would be far more people
revolting over the loss of these things than over the loss of their right to
own firearms.
Plus much of the world commerce is done through
the Internet now. The economic loss at this point would be staggering. You
wonder if governments are really and truly that willing to cripple the
economies they parasitize in order to maintain their last bits of control.
So don't worry. We won.
In fact, you can even break out the champagne!
Your main concern is surviving the turbulent transitions ahead. The main
issue is getting through the collapse of this statist monetary and financial
system.
We know liberty has already won and we're celebrating. We just have to get
our readers through the transition.
By the time all is said and done,
-
the
world will use mostly gold, silver and bitcoins for money
-
there will be no
state-enabled central banks
-
there will be no massive intrusions by
massive governments
If we're really fortunate, there will be no
government intrusion at all... because humanity will fully wake up
and realize what governments really are:
an unnecessary evil.
So keep your head down and stay sharp for now.
But rejoice. Before you know it, it will be safe
to celebrate out in the open.
