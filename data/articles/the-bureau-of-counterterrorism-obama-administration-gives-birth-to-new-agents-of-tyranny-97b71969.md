Apparently having goons grope the public nearly
every step of the way as they walk under the watchful eyes of full-spectrum
surveillance just isn't good enough.
The new Bureau of Counterterrorism was announced on January 4th
by Obama's State Department as an agency with,
The mission... to lead the [State]
Department in the U.S. Governments effort to counter terrorism abroad
and to secure the United States against foreign terrorist threats.
The bureau will lead in supporting U.S.
counterterrorism diplomacy and seek to strengthen homeland security,
countering violent extremism, and build the capacity of partner nations
to deal effectively with terrorism.

Probably the least comforting part of this
announcement is the use of the term "violent extremism."
It is under this very flexible definition which
allows the agents of tyranny to assign it to anyone, at any time, thus
making them susceptible to the full arsenal of the War on Terror, which we
now know includes the
indefinite detention and torture of American citizens
on American soil.
The idea that security actually needs to be further strengthened by a new
bureau in addition to,
...and
every other alphabet agency ignoring the Constitution is a clear sign that
the U.S. government is done with even pretending to listen to its own
citizens, or those around the world who are subjected to dehumanization
while traveling within U.S. borders, as well as when they return home.
In reality this bureau is not new at all; it was similarly established in
1996...
in Israel.
It, too, received an "upgrade" similar to what
the Obama
administration is now proposing.
The U.S. bureau had operated on a previously
smaller scale in America, but one look at the newly released fact sheet
demonstrates its expanded role for the future. It is worth reading in full,
as it speaks for itself, but we should pay particular attention to the
mention of "ideologies" and "ideas," as well as "international cooperation."
So what are you thinking?
Fact Sheet
Office of the Spokesperson
Washington, DC
January 4, 2012
As the threat from al-Qaida becomes
more diffuse, it is in the interest of the United States to forge
closer ties with the governments and communities on the front lines
and to help them build up their counterterrorism capacity.
We need
to expand our efforts to build an international counterterrorism
network that is as nimble and adaptive as our adversaries. So we have launched a diplomatic
offensive to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation on
counterterrorism.
We have a broad and ambitious agenda, and to carry
out this work, I am upgrading our office devoted to counterterrorism
to a full-fledged bureau within the State Department.

to Counterterrorism
September 9, 2011
The Department of State announces the
establishment of the Bureau of Counterterrorism, fulfilling one of the
key recommendations of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review
concluded in December 2010.
The Bureau of Counterterrorism will lead the
Departments engagement in support of U.S. government efforts to counter
terrorism abroad and to secure the United States against foreign
terrorist threats.
The new Bureau will assume the
responsibilities of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism.
The Challenge
The United States faces a continuing terrorist threat from al-Qaida and
other groups and individuals who subscribe to violent extremism. While
we have made much progress in combating terrorism since the 9/11
attacks, challenges remain.
Together with defense, intelligence, law
enforcement, and homeland security, diplomacy and development are
critical to keeping America safe.
To secure our future, we must continue to
strengthen our international coalition against terrorism, build foreign
partner capacity to mitigate terrorist threats, reinforce resilience
against attacks, and counter the ideologies and ideas that fuel violent
extremism around the world.
The Mission
The Bureau of Counterterrorism, in coordination with Department
leadership, the National Security Staff, and other U.S. government
agencies, will develop and implement counterterrorism strategies,
policies, operations, and programs.
It will lead in supporting U.S.
counterterrorism diplomacy and seek to strengthen homeland security,
counter violent extremism, and build the capacity of partner nations to
deal effectively with terrorism.
The Bureau
The Bureau of Counterterrorism will implement its mission by:
-
Developing and implementing counterterrorism strategies, policies, and
operations
The U.S. government has no greater responsibility than to
protect the American people.
The Bureau of Counterterrorism will play an
integral role in meeting this obligation by leading the Departments
engagement to develop and implement counterterrorism strategies,
policies, and operations to disrupt and defeat the networks that support
terrorism.
The Bureau will work to safeguard American security interests
while promoting our values, including our support for human rights,
democracy, and the rule of law.
-
Strengthening counterterrorism diplomacy
Strengthening existing partnerships and
building new relationships is a cornerstone of U.S. counterterrorism
policy.
The Bureau of Counterterrorism will engage with bilateral
partners, regional organizations, and the United Nations to broaden and
deepen counterterrorism cooperation.
In one of many initiatives, the Bureau will
lead U.S. government efforts on behalf of the State Department to
support the Global Counterterrorism Forum, a new multilateral initiative
focused on setting the international counterterrorism agenda for the
21st century.
-
Strengthening homeland security.
Securing the homeland from external
terrorist threats is central to U.S. foreign policy.
The Bureau of
Counterterrorism will be the principal State Department link with the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on counterterrorism strategy and
operations.
The Bureau will work in partnership with
DHS, as well as other agencies and bureaus, to strengthen international
cooperation on a wide range of homeland security issues including
transportation security, the interdiction of terrorist travel, and
critical infrastructure protection.
-
Countering violent extremism
To defeat terrorists, we must undermine
their ability to recruit.
The Bureau of Counterterrorism will focus
the State Department in U.S. government efforts to counter violent
extremism, thereby reducing radicalization and mobilization abroad.
The
Bureau will work to delegitimize the violent extremist narrative, to
develop positive alternatives for populations vulnerable to recruitment,
and to build partner government and civil society capacity to counter
violent extremism themselves.
-
Building the capacity of foreign partners
The security of the United States depends on
the strength of our partners and allies abroad.
With capable partners
who are able to manage the threats within their borders and regions, the
likelihood of U.S. forces being called into action is greatly reduced.
The Bureau of Counterterrorism will work
with other bureau and agency partners in supporting U.S. government work
to build international partner counterterrorism capacity in the civilian
sector and will contribute to efforts in the military and defense
sectors.
The Future
Protecting the United States, the American people and our interests
abroad will remain a challenge in the 21st Century. New terrorist
threats will require innovative strategies, creative diplomacy, and
stronger partnerships.
By establishing the Bureau of
Counterterrorism, the Department of State will strengthen its efforts to
meet this challenge.

Let's weigh in:
-
Is this really the future we want?
Because it is being written for us
-
Is this how we approve of our tax
dollars being spent?
-
Or is it high time to
declare your own independence and
once and for all renounce what it being done in our names at any
cost?
One thing is for certain, it is no time to
remain silent; the drums have started to roll.
