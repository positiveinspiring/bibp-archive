# Soros-funded "Media Matters" caught Secretly Plotting with Facebook to 
Stop Alternative Media

In 2010,
George
Soros announced he would be
giving $1 million to "Media Matters" to,
"hold Fox
News accountable for the false and misleading information
they so often broadcast."
Translation:
Soros-funded
Media Matters to combat Fox News, something it
ostensibly labeled as "fake news," an apparent smear tactic
deployed as a result ostensibly progressive agenda.
Fast-forward
to 2017, and the billionaire trouble-maker is now using his
influence at Media Matters to combat "fake news" on Facebook,
except this time they're trying to keep it secret.
When
Facebook
announced at the end of 2016 it would be working to eliminate
"fake news" stories on its social media platform, many news
media organizations, including The Free Thought Project (TFTP), were
understandably nervous, and with good reason.
Not long after the
announcement was made, TFTP was banned by Facebook for over two
weeks, only having their account restored just days before the
start of the New Year.
The Washington Post also put out a hit
piece targeting TFTP and others, which has since been retracted,
in a blatant attempt at smearing their critics.
Now, it seems,
we know who is behind this Facebook crackdown on alternative
media:
the George Soros-funded Media Matters.
According to
The Free Beacon, it was revealed through internal Media
Matters documents that Media Matters was quietly working with Facebook to identify and eliminate fake news and propaganda.
"Media Matters told current and prospective donors at a retreat
in Florida over the weekend that it has been in discussions with Facebook leadership about their policies on inaccurate and
partisan news stories on the website that many liberals blame
for political losses last year," the Beacon writes.
According to a
"briefing book" given to attendees at the Media Matters
conference and obtained by the Beacon, the left-wing news
organization admitted,
"We've been engaging with Facebook
leadership behind the scenes to share our expertise and offer
input on developing meaningful solutions."
Facebook promised
that,
"Media Matters will serve as their partner," in having a
more active role in combating what it will determine is "fake
news."
In other words, Facebook, and its CEO
Mark Zuckerberg,
are working with the militantly progressive news media
organization to silence any organization it deems to be "fake
news" which are little more than news sites who challenge the
status quo.
If this doesn't
seem fair, that's because it isn't.
It goes against every
principle of journalism, free speech, and freedom of press the
country has historically defended tooth and nail. By its own
admission, Media Matters is censoring free speech on Facebook,
and all with the company's blessing.
The soon to be scandal for Facebook is the latest in a long series of scandals which has
targeted the free speech rights of certain individuals, and
organizations.
According to
the Free Beacon, everything seems to be going as Media Matters
planned it.
They used a crafty fundraising campaign to put
pressure on Facebook to address the newly invented crisis of the
proliferation of fake news, forcing an announcement by the
company that it would be weeding out purveyors of "fake news."
Now, Media
Matters is confirming what many suspected already, that a
Soros-funded organization was attempting to curtail free speech
on Facebook.
"After Facebook responded to our campaign by
acknowledging the problem of fake news and agreeing to do
something about it, we began a dialogue," Media Matters' brief
states.
Going further
Media Matters confirmed the relationship
saying,
"It became clear from these conversations that Facebook
needed our help in fully understanding the problem and
identifying concrete solutions."
Media Matters confirms its goal
is to,
"adjust its
(Facebook) model to stem the flow of damaging fake news on
its platform's pages."
Building on
their successful relationship with Facebook, Media Matters wrote
in their brief that they intend to use their power, money and
influence to force
Google into following Facebook's lead on
combating "fake news."
The Soros-funded organization bragged
about the success they're already having at Google.
"After Google
revised their terms of service in order to prohibit so-called
fake news sites from using their advertising network, it was
Media Matters that had the information necessary to identify 40
of the worst fake news sites to which this policy applied," the
company wrote.
"Google
will cut off these pages' accompanying sites' access to
revenue by pulling their access to Google's ad platform."
The pressure to
censor free speech on social media platforms is apparently
working.
The Soros-funded
Media Matters not only was successful
in getting Facebook and Google to consider "fake news" a
problem, but also helped the two companies deprive the targeted
organizations from the funding they need to continue
publication.
The Free Beacon
wrote;
Facebook announced on
Wednesday that it would change the algorithm behind its
popular "trending topics" section, which will now base
popularity on the number of Facebook-designated publishers
discussing a story, rather than the number of users
discussing it.
Google also said on
Wednesday that it has banned 200 publishers from its
advertising network as part of its efforts to combat fake
news sites.
The company refused to say which sites had been
targeted.
