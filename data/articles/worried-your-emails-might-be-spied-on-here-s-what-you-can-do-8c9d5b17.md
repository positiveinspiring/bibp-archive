# Worried Your Emails Might Be Spied On? - Here's what You can Do

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/SOCIOPOLITICA/sociopol_internet228.htm

We live in a
post-Edward Snowden world, in which
U.S. tech companies
have been accused of complicity in mass surveillance by the
U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).
One recent allegation is the claim
that
Yahoo scanned hundreds of millions of emails at the NSA's
request.
We don't truly know how much or how
often this is happening within the companies that host millions
of people's email accounts.
According to Reuters,
Yahoo was ordered by the secret U.S. Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court (FISC)
to scour emails for a specific string of characters. This is
significant, as it required Yahoo to create a custom-built
program for real-time surveillance of email traffic.
The power for this type of
surveillance was expanded by the
U.S. Patriot Act, which allows for the use of secret
National
Security Letters (NSL) to compel service providers to hand over
customer data.
The letters come with gag orders,
prohibiting companies like Yahoo from even admitting that they
have been ordered to monitor customers.
But email scanning does not only
occur at the behest of national security agencies.
The past decade has seen the rise
of,
...who collect your information for
behavioral profiling and targeted advertising.
-
Google has admitted to
scanning emails to deliver targeted advertising and customized
search results.
-
Facebook is currently facing
legal action for scanning private messages to do the same.
-
And earlier this year Yahoo itself
settled a class action lawsuit for scanning non-Yahoo
customer emails without consent.
Protecting your
privacy
So with all this going on,
One way is through encryption, which
allows only the sender and the receiver to read the content of
messages, as it converts information into a secret code that
requires a key to decode it.
Public-key cryptography
is one type of encryption, involving two paired keys - one
public and one private. When an encrypted email is sent it is
encoded or "locked" with the receiver's public key. Only the
receiver can "unlock" it with their private key.
End-to-end encryption
involves encrypting information before it leaves your device,
with it only being decrypted once it reaches the receiver's
device. In other words, it is encrypted "at the ends" where the
keys are held.
This means that security and privacy
are not dependent on the channel of communication - in this case
the email provider - because if the message is intercepted it
cannot be deciphered. This prevents eavesdropping in transit.
There are now numerous services that
promise free end-to-end encrypted communication, including,
Look for those with open source code
because it
enables peer-review, guaranteeing there are no backdoors.
The push-back
against encryption
With increased encryption comes more
demands from authorities for companies to "unlock" information.
The best example may be the
Apple-FBI case, which saw the FBI attempt to compel Apple to
unlock a suspect's iPhone. In the end this wasn't necessary.
There has also been a simultaneous rise in companies like
Cellebrite who offer
digital forensic services to decrypt and extract data.
Therefore, the best services use
principles of
privacy by design, that limit how much information the
service provider themselves can collect or access.
ProtonMail and Signal, for example,
cannot access
their users' information, no matter how hard they try. If
issued with a subpoena all they could provide is the date
and time a user registered and the last date of connection.
Partly as a result of this
encryption war, some states are considering outlawing
encryption entirely.
Criminalizing encryption has been
discussed in,
...and
elsewhere.
Tech companies
safeguarding secrecy
But not all hope is lost.
There is a growing trend of tech
companies fighting back and refusing to comply with surveillance
orders.
This shows that service providers
are aware of the importance of developing and maintaining
consumer trust in matters of privacy.
They are intimately, and
commercially, invested in protecting it.
Transparency reports
and warrant canaries
Another way companies have attempted
to gain trust is through
transparency
reports that detail the orders they have received from
authorities.
These can be found on company
websites and are often reported in the media. Many of these
reports feature a workaround to the restrictions on letting
customers know if surveillance has been ordered.
Companies simply include a statement
that they have not been subject to a secret order.
If
this statement ever goes missing, customers know an order has
been issued.
This is known as a "warrant
canary".
-
Several companies
routinely issue transparency reports with warrant
canaries
-
Apple and
Reddit have set them off, implying that they have
received secret orders to provide data
The same workaround may not be
available in Australia however.
Recent data-retention laws
introduced
journalist information warrants that made it
an offence to disclose information about the existence (or
non-existence) of the warrant, effectively outlawing
warrant canaries for journalists in Australia.
The future
Encryption and transparency reports
are some of the last protections that consumers have against
both governments and the big tech companies we rely on.
As more of our lives transition
online, we will need them to protect civil rights and individual
privacy. We can't afford for either to be weakened or outlawed.
There are a couple of challenges
under way.
NSL statutes and gag orders are
currently being challenged by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and
members of the U.S. Congress as unconstitutional.
Watch this space.
