One of Microsofts latest
patent applications is a humdinger.
It proposes to turn the
Kinect camera into a snitch for movie
studios, reporting back just how many friends youve got in your living room
and what theyre watching.
Think that sounds alarmist?
Heres what it actually says:
The users consuming the content on a
display device are monitored so that if the number of user-views
licensed is exceeded, remedial action may be taken.
Its that blatant - a system to spy on private
viewing habits.
If put into practice, Microsofts plan could
mean that the film youre watching suddenly stops playing if it detects that
youve got more people squashed on to the sofa than the license allows.
Youd then be prompted to buy a more expensive license to keep watching.
Its as if Big Brother had built
1984s Telescreen not to monitor the population but to ensure no
one was pirating the Two Minutes Hate.
In all likelihood, Microsoft will struggle to
actually apply this patent in the real world. While copyright holders would
be delighted, customers would be turned off by such a draconian system. But
thats whats interesting about this application and patent applications in
general: they often reveal what companies would do if they could
get away with it.
The black and white drawings and blandly
technical language can cover immoral, scary and downright evil ideas.
There was an even more
striking example from Apple earlier this year.
In September, it was granted a patent for Apparatus
and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device,
i.e. a system allowing companies or governments to remotely disable mobile
phones and tablets in a particular area.
While Apple mentions benign examples such as
preventing phone calls from disturbing concerts or ensuring devices are
switched off on planes, it also states:
Covert police or government operations may
require complete "blackout" conditions.
Thats exactly the kind of feature certain
governments would love to use to suppress pictures and videos. The patent
Apple put its stamp on is a handy form of censorship regardless of whether
it will ever apply it.
Last year, Googles chairman, Eric Schmidt,
said that the company would hold off from creating a facial recognition
service because it would be,
crossing the creepy line.
Still, Google has filed for and been granted
extensive patents in the area and, as its Project Glass augmented reality
goggles move forward, who knows when the creepy line will shift?
