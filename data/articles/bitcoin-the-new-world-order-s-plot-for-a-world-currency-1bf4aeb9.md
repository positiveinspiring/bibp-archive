As a general rule, if anything is covered en
masse
by the mainstream media, then I tend to believe that which I am
watching is actually one long promotional spot.
The same could potentially be said for Bitcoin
as over the past months its popularity has grown so much that anarcho-capitalist... Libertarian... Freedom
Fighter against mankinds two biggest enemies, the State and Central Banks,
Dollar Vigilante Chief Editor, Jeff Berwick, has been on CNBC, CNN, Fox
News, and BBC, and other mainstream outlets.
What brought on this sudden attention? No, not
our anarcho-capitalism, but our announcement of the worlds first
BitcoinATM.
So, is Jeff just a patsy so that the New World
Order can bring in a digital currency? I began wondering this myself, and I
came to what I think is a reasonable conclusion.
What many skeptics fail to understand is that
the so-called
New World Order - with its global governance, fiat currencies
and so on - has already, for the most part, been implemented on a global
scale. Especially economically.
For instance, 95%+ of fiat money today is
digital, and it's all based on
the Federal Reserve System, thus creating one
worldwide currency with lots of different designs on the actual notes
supposedly representing the various cultural backgrounds of nation-states.
Despite nearly everything being digital already,
there are mainstream technologies that go above-and-beyond, aiming to rule
out the need for cash. One particular app for this cashless society,
above-and-beyond credit and debit, is called Square, and was developed by
Jack Dorsey, Twitters co-founder.
According to CNN,
this is a telltale
signs that the mobile-payments revolution has arrived.
CNN writes,
as anyone who has studied American consumers know,
changing the way
Americans pay for stuff is going to be really hard work.
But Bitcoin is turning out to be a force to be
reckoned with.
For instance, in comparison to long-time friends of the
liberty movement, gold and silver, Bitcoin seems to have been the play to
make over the past six months and beyond.
For months, besides today's drop
from $150-$115, after running to $150 from $105, our charts over at
Gold Silver
Bitcoin have shown a bimetallic standard precipitously dropping relative
to Bitcoin:
The CNN article surmises that,
Paying by
phone will be as transformative as the advent of the credit card in the
1950s. It will change the way we shop and bank.
With powerful smartphones and tablets taking center stage on both sides of the
checkout counter, it will reshape the relationship between buyer and
seller.
Not only will the phone or the tablet become a wallet for
consumers, but it will also turn into a credit card reader and a
register for merchants.
Shoppers will use their mobile device as a
coupon book, a comparison-shopping tool, and a repository of those
unwieldy loyalty cards they carry from everyone from giant retail chains
to the corner bakery.
And your smartphones will serve as beacons that
will alert a retailer when you walk into its store so that it can
recommend products, show you reviews, or direct you to aisle five, where
that beanbag chair you didnt buy last week still beckons - and you can
now have it for 10% off.
You wont even need a few singles to tip the
valet or pay the dog walker, because theyll take mobile payments too.
This basically explains the Bitcoin experience.
One big difference? While CNN assumes a central authority, Bitcoin does not.
With big players like AT&T, Verizon, Visa, Mastercard, Google, Microsoft,
and eBays PayPal unit investing in billions in digital payment solutions,
it is no surprise that the mainstream media is serving the idea to the
public domain in kind and uncritical ways.
One of their assumptions is a
monopoly on the technology by some corporation friendly to compromising.
While the mainstream press has been unable to ignore Bitcoin, it certainly
has been critical of Bitcoin being prone to hackers. Sure, a great many
people have lost bitcoins.
But, imagine if the general population had to
become their own banks. Most of them would get eaten right away by sharks in
the economic waters.
The CNN article champions the ease of digital
transactions, and the time saved.
Bitcoin is surely faster:
While this
revolution will be powered by complex technology, its ultimate effect
will be to greatly simplify things for consumers. Think about my
experience at Grumpy.
While I had to fiddle with my phone ahead of time
- to upload my credit card to the Square app and to authorize it to talk
to the Grumpy register - once there, the phone never left my pocket. All
I had to do was order my cappuccino.
The article portends that,
a cashless future is more real than many
suspect.
According to the global head of mobile at Visa,
financial institutions are going to have a
big role to play.
We are, I think, on a precipice of some
fundamental change in the way money is exchanged between consumers and
businesses, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said as she opened the
first of a string of hearings one year ago on cashless ways.
The Federal Reserve found that 12 percent of
cell phone users had already made a payment through their phones, and almost
two-thirds of technology experts surveyed by the Pew Center on Internet and
American Life said they expected mobile payments to eclipse cash and credit
cards by 2020.
But, Square and similar technologies are
different from Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has caught on with a younger generation
that, as Trace
Mayer once put it to me (to paraphrase),
grew up in a digital sea. [The
younger generation] are fish in a digital sea, whereas the older generation
are snorkeling tourists.
In other words,
p2p technology is a concept
in-and-of itself for the Internet-literate. That goes a long way to
explaining its popularity.
As the late Bob Chapman of the International
Forecaster asked about gold and silver relative to fiat, where else are you
going to go in a time of ubiquitous deceit? Bitcoin offers yet another
alternative to what Ive coined a rebels portfolio already heavy in
silver and gold.
The pseudonymous nature (read: not totally
anonymous) of Bitcoin does associate IPs with wallets.
But, the paper-trail
is a more obtuse alternative to the traditional bank account.
The Powers
That Be (TPTB) focus intensely on record-keeping, the historical record shows this,
and so any added time-cost for their zeroing-in on you acts as the new
privacy.
The popular appeal of Bitcoin - its p2p
foundation - is as simple as first-language to the younger generation. Trace
explains this well.
Max Keiser recently said that he called gold in 2008,
and people asked,
What if the government confiscates my gold?
To which Max
Keiser responds,
What you should have been asking yourself is, 'What if the
government confiscates my bank account?'
He then goes on:
Since $5 per BTC
Ive been recommending Bitcoin and many of you asked, What if the
government shuts off the Internet?
Max Keiser answers thus:
What you
should have been asking yourselves is, What if the government shuts down
the banks?
And so, there are fundamental differences
between the digital payment technologies pursued publicly by TPTB, and
Bitcoin.
This is what caught the eye of so many tech-savvy and
Austrian-minded individuals across the world, but largely concentrated in
the US and greater North America. Now, with Bitcoin skyrocketing from $9.31
last Fall to $150 today, the power of the Internet has never been clearer.
Bitcoin is a bet on the Internet. And, if you
read our recent
TDV
Homegrown issue, you might have learned something about the Egyptian
experience with a government using the "internet kill switch."
I wrote:
Over one
year ago, the Egyptian government cut off approximately 88% of the
countrys internet access. Here is what happened: The government owned
the biggest Internet provider in the nation, and only had to contact a
few other companies to make this happen.
The
government ordered the shutdown of nearly all Internet access within
Egypt. Ninety-three percent of Egypts networks went down. One of the
only connections to the Internet that was not blocked belongs to Noor
Data Network, the ISP used by the Egyptian
(stock) Exchange.
I then went over some of the ways Egyptians
worked around this Internet shutdown, as well as the likelihood of it
happening in the US.
The conclusion of the article was bullish for
the Internet, for
the Internet is a vibrant and evolving system.
It is
crucial to everyone's way of life, and we see this with centralized and
decentralized payment solutions. The Internet will continue to be defended by its
users and impinged upon by its self-appointed overseers.
It's a battle in which any Dollar Vigilante
would delightfully indulge.
