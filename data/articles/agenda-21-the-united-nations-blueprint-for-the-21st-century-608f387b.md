"Effective execution of
Agenda 21
will require a profound reorientation of all human society,
unlike
anything the world has ever experienced a major shift
in the priorities of
both governments and individuals
and an unprecedented redeployment of human
and financial resources.
This shift will demand that a concern for
the
environmental consequences of every human action
be integrated into
individual and collective decision-making
at every level."
Excerpt - UN Agenda 21
As described in an article,
Agenda 21 was
the main outcome of the United Nation's Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro
in 1992...
Agenda 21 outlines, in detail,
the United Nations' vision for a
centrally
managed global society.
This contract binds governments around the world to
the United Nations' plan for controlling the way we live, eat, learn, move
and communicate - all under the noble banner of saving the earth.
If fully
implemented, Agenda 21 would have the government involved in every aspect of
life of every human on earth.
Agenda 21 spreads it tentacles from Governments, to federal and local
authorities, and right down to community groups.
Chapter 28 of Agenda 21
specifically calls for each community to formulate its own
Local
Agenda 21:
"Each local authority should enter into a dialogue with its citizens,
local organizations, and private enterprises to formulate 'a Local
Agenda 21.'
Through consultation and consensus-building, local authorities would
learn from citizens and from local, civic, community, business and
industrial organizations and acquire the information needed for
formulating the best strategies."
Agenda 21, Chapter 28,
sec 1.3
Interestingly, in April 1991, fourteen months before Earth Summit, Prince
Charles held a private
two
day international conference aboard the
royal yacht Britannia, moored off the coast of Brazil.
His goal was to bring
together key international figures in an attempt to achieve a degree of
harmony between the various countries that would gather at the Summit.
Al
Gore was present, along with senior officials from the United
Nations and
the World Bank.
At the summit 179 nations officially signed Agenda 21 and many more have
followed since. Nearly 12,000 local and federal authorities have legally
committed themselves to the Agenda.
In practice this means that all their
plans and policies must begin with an assessment of how the plan or policy
meets the requirements of Agenda 21, and no plans or policies are allowed to
contradict any part of the Agenda. Local authorities are audited by UN
inspectors and the results of the audits are placed on the UN website.
You
can see how many local authorities in your country were bound by Agenda 21
in 2001
here.
The number has increased significantly since then.
The official opening ceremony was conducted by the Dalai Lama and centered
around a Viking long-ship that was constructed to celebrate the summit and
sailed to Rio from Norway. The ship was appropriately
named
Gaia.
A huge mural of a
beautiful woman
holding the earth within her hands adorned the entrance to the summit. Al
Gore lead the US delegation where he was joined by 110 Heads of State, and
representatives of more than 800 NGO's.
Maurice Strong, Club of Rome member, devout Bahai, founder and first
Secretary General of UNEP, has been the driving force behind the birth and
imposition of Agenda 21.
While he chaired the Earth Summit, outside his wife
Hanne and 300 followers called the
Wisdom-Keepers, continuously beat
drums, chanted prayers
to Gaia, and trended scared flames in order to establish
and hold the energy field" for the duration of the summit.
You can
view
actual footage
of these ceremonies on YouTube.
During the opening speech Maurice Strong
made the following statements:
"The
concept of national sovereignty has been an immutable, indeed sacred,
principle of international relations.
It is a principle which will yield
only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental
cooperation. It is simply not feasible for sovereignty to be exercised
unilaterally by individual nation states, however powerful.
The global
community must be assured of environmental security."

"It is the responsibility of each human being today to
choose between the force of darkness and the force of light. We must
therefore transform our attitudes, and adopt a renewed respect for the
superior laws of Divine Nature."
Link
"Current lifestyles and
consumption patterns of the affluent middle class - involving high meat
intake, use of fossil fuels, appliances, air-conditioning, and suburban
housing - are not sustainable.
A shift is necessary which will require a
vast strengthening of the multilateral system, including the United Nations."
Link
Among other things, the agenda called for a
Global Biodiversity Assessment of the
State of the Earth.
Prepared by the UN Environmental Program (UNEP), this
1140 page document armed UN leaders with the "ecological
basis, and moral authority" they needed to validate their global
management system.
The GBA concludes on page 863 that,
"the
root causes of the loss of biodiversity are embedded in the way societies
use resources. This world view is
characteristic of large scale societies, heavily dependent on resources
brought from considerable distances.
It is a world view that is
characterized by the denial of sacred attributes in nature,
a characteristic that became firmly established about 2000 years ago with
the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religious traditions.
Eastern cultures with
religious traditions such as Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism did not depart
as drastically from the perspective of humans as members of a community of
beings including other living and non-living elements."
In other
words Christians and Moslems are to blame for the sorry state of the world
because their religions do not involve worshipping sacred
nature."
Following the Earth Summit Maurice Strong was named
Assistant Secretary
General of the United Nations, and was appointed to the position of
Chief
Policy Advisor by Kofi Annan.
He was
also a member of the UN's
Commission on Global Governance, and
the key architect of the Kyoto Protocol.
Strong and his wife have also
established the
Manitou Foundation, providing land in
the Colorado to an eclectic mix of religious groups, including,
-
the Crestone
Mountain Zen Center
-
the Spiritual Life Institute (a Catholic Carmelite
monastery)
-
the Haidakhandi Universal Ashram
-
the Sri Aurobindo Learning
Center
-
Mangala Shri Bhuti (Tibetan Buddhists)
-
Karma Thegsum Tashi
Gomang (Indian mystics)
The Strongs have located their spiritual centre in
the Colorado mountains because:
"The Strongs learned
that since antiquity indigenous peoples had revered this pristine wilderness
as a place for conducting their vision quests and receiving shamanic
trainings.
It is prophesied that the world's religious traditions would
gather here and help move the world toward globally conscious co-existence
and co-creation."
So, what exactly does Agenda 21 contain?
It consists of 115 different
and very specific programs designed to facilitate, or to force, the
transition to Sustainable Development.
The objective, clearly enunciated by
the leaders of the Earth Summit, is to bring about a change in the present
system of independent nations.
The agenda is broken up into 8
'programme
areas for action':
-
Agriculture
-
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management
-
Education
-
Energy and Housing
-
Population
-
Public Health
-
Resources and recycling
-
Transportation, Sustainable Economic Development
As you can see Agenda 21 addresses nearly every aspect of modern life.
If
you have a spare few days the entire document can be read
here.
I encourage the reader to at least read the Table of Contents in order to
understand the true scope of this 'blueprint for the 21st century.'
I
won't
torture the reader by going into the document in too much depth but I will
provide the first six paragraphs so that you can understand the true intent
of Agenda 21:
1.1.
Humanity stands at a defining moment in history.
We are confronted with a perpetuation of disparities between and within
nations, a worsening of poverty, hunger, ill health and illiteracy, and the
continuing deterioration of the ecosystems on which we depend for our
well-being. However, integration of environment and development concerns and
greater attention to them will lead to the fulfilment of basic needs,
improved living standards for all, better protected and managed ecosystems
and a safer, more prosperous future. No nation can achieve this on its own;
but together we can - in a global partnership for
sustainable development.
1.2. This
global
partnership must build on the premises of General Assembly resolution
44/228 of 22 December 1989, which was adopted when the nations of the world
called for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and
on the acceptance of the need to take a balanced and integrated approach to
environment and development questions.
1.3.
Agenda 21 addresses the pressing
problems of today and also aims at preparing the world
for the challenges of the next century. It reflects a
global consensus and political commitment at the
highest level on development and environment cooperation. Its
successful implementation is first and foremost the responsibility of
Governments. National strategies, plans, policies and processes are crucial
in achieving this. International cooperation should support and supplement
such national efforts. In this context, the United
Nations system has a key role to play. Other international, regional
and sub-regional organizations are also called upon to contribute to this
effort. The broadest public participation and the
active involvement of the non-governmental organizations and other
groups should also be encouraged.
1.4.
The developmental and environmental
objectives of Agenda 21 will require a substantial
flow of new and additional financial resources to developing
countries, in order to cover the incremental costs for the actions they have
to undertake to deal with global environmental problems and to accelerate
sustainable development. Financial resources are also required for
strengthening the capacity of international institutions for the
implementation of Agenda 21.
1.5. In the implementation of the relevant
programme areas identified in Agenda 21, special attention should be given
to the particular circumstances facing the economies in transition. It must
also be recognized that these countries are facing unprecedented challenges
in transforming their economies, in some cases in the midst of considerable
social and political tension.
1.6. The programme areas that constitute
Agenda 21 are described in terms of the basis for action, objectives,
activities and means of implementation. Agenda 21 is a
dynamic program. It will be carried out by the various actors according to
the different situations, capacities and priorities of countries and regions
in full respect of all the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on
Environment and Development. It could evolve over time in the light
of changing needs and circumstances. This process
marks the beginning of a new global partnership for sustainable development.
Like many 'green movement initiatives' Agenda 21 is a
'wolf in sheep's
clothing'.
As explained in my
brief biography
I have been actively involved in preparing Agenda 21 action plans and
monitoring compliance with environmental permits.
All
the policies and plans we developed were required to begin with a
description of how they met the objectives of Agenda 21 and various other UN
agreements, and were audited too determine how they complied with UN
requirements. It was these experiences that lead to my
research into what was 'behind it all' and the subsequent publication of
this website.
Agenda 21 is not an environmental management policy, but an attempt to
impose a global centrally planned quasi-government administered by the
United Nations.
Under Agenda 21 all central government and local authority
signatories are required to conform strictly to a common prescribed standard
and hence this is just communism resurrected in a new guise.
Now that Agenda
21 has gained a stranglehold on global regulatory and planning processes
Maurice Strong and his
Club of Rome colleagues have moved on to the next
phase of the Global Green Agenda.
In association with fellow CoR member
Mikhail Gorbachev, Strong co-chaired
the committee responsible for drafting the Earth Charter. Compared to the
2500 pages that make up Agenda 21 and the BGA it is a tiny document - only 4
pages long.
But it is of far more significance to the
Global Green Agenda.
The Earth Charter is a,
declaration of fundamental
principles for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in
the 21st century".
It is the constitution for a
New 'Green' Order.
