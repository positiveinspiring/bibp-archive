Why the Earth will not be destroyed
(Bruce Cathies Book, "Harmonics 33")
Question:
Cosmic Awareness:
L.A. asks: "In 1968 Captain
Bruce Cathies book,
Harmonics 33,
and in 1971 his book,
Ufos and Anti-Gravity were published. Both books
have to do with a grid system that was established on this Earth by the
Great
White Brotherhood to keep man from blowing himself up by nuclear destruction
as they did on planet Maldek thousands of years ago. My question is this:
"If the grid system is in fact in place, and the detonation of nuclear
devices must be done at certain times and certain places on grid points as
described in Harmonics 33, is it possible to have a nuclear attack
such as the controlled press talks about with thousands of target points vulnerable
at any one time, or are only a few target points susceptible to destruction
at the push of a button?" If only a limited number are susceptible, is
our government keeping the masses under control by the suppression of this
knowledge, or is it best that people not get too comfortable with the idea
that total destruction is not possible at any one time and fall back asleep,
thinking they are safe?"
The Higher Plan
of evolution on this plane
This Awareness indicates that essentially,
the concept disclosed in Harmonics 33 as that is very closely reflective
of the Higher Plan of evolution on this plane. This Awareness indicates that
in understanding this, entities can better perceive the flow of events and
the nature of manipulation on this plane. This Awareness indicates that that
essentially, much of the programmed information into consciousness regarding
the threats and regarding predictions of things to come are designed, in fact,
to change the consciousness of entities by making them more aware of the larger
experience and less concerned about the personal experience.
This Awareness indicates that predictions
in regard to Earth shifts, earthquakes, Earth changes, great calamities and
chaos always accompanies sudden and massive changes in cultural consciousness.
This Awareness indicates that these predictions, while seldom occurring in
fact, do have their effect on the consciousness level of the culture,
and the culture undergoes the changes. This Awareness indicates that
it is the culture which experiences the shift in poles, the new alignment
of polarities or the chances of a chaotic nature; it is the culture
that experiences the Armageddon. This Awareness indicates that the culture
being that which is not so much of a social or physical experience as that
which is of the mental and evolutionary experience in regards to awareness
levels.
The Earth is a living being
This Awareness indicates that these
changes in consciousness are accompanied by reflective actions in physical
levels which may be equated to
acupuncture
probes in the mass consciousness or in the body of humanity. This
Awareness reminds entities that the
Earth is a living being and that entities
essentially are its information-gathering nerves and feelings, that these
entities or beings inhabiting this Earth being, are similar to the nerve-gathering
actions of a physical body: the little molecular electronic creatures within
your physical body which sense, which see, which smell, which taste, which
hear and which feel the external world. These little electromagnetic beings
which inhabit each cell of your body, have their counterpart in the body of
the Earth as little human beings, little animals, little plants, little sea
creatures, which gather information as to experience which the Earth is having.
This Awareness indicates essentially,
being that the human creature is the most advanced physical body on the Earth
plane, it may be considered as the brain of the Earth, and its responsibility
may be considered as an action of having to think for the Earth itself. This
Awareness indicates that once entities begin to recognize part of their action
is to think for the Earth and its welfare, the entity then becomes the New
being. This Awareness indicates so long as the entity is only thinking for
his/her own personal interested and sees himself upon the Earth and considers
the Earth to be a non-living creature, the entity can easily forego any responsibility
for the large picture, for the general scheme of things; the entity can simply
be a little victim of fate.
This Awareness indicates however,
wherein the entity recognizes that his or her role is to think for the Earth,
to be part of the brain and thinking capacity, to be the consciousness of
the Earth itself in its relationship with other planets in the universe and
all of the other social bodies of that universal society, wherein entities
recognize themselves as being the brain of the Earth, thinking for it in its
relationship in the society of heavenly bodies; then entities begin to comprehend
the awesome and total and important responsibilities which they have been
given by their creator:... And once these responsibilities are understood,
then the confusion as to what is morally right or morally wrong is dissipated,
and entities then have the wisdom of recognizing by circumstance or the broad
and general experience, what is morally right and morally wrong in terms of
the overall effect of the Earths experience in its relationship with other
heavenly bodies; and entities then become the conscience for the evolving
Earth, so that they can direct its evolvement and development in the society
of heavenly bodies.
