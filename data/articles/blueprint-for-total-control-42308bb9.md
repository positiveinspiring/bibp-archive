"Remember,
the elite are just a few among
the six billion people on this planet. The entire source of their power
is their ability to corrupt natural instincts and direct subconscious
needs into channels of expression that further the ends of total
control. This is all they have.
And once this principle is understood by
more people, it will cease to be effective. Our world will change
spontaneously around us, and we will be free to love one another in the
way we always intended."
"The real source of the problem is the way we are treating our young.
Because we prefer to give them things to demonstrate our love for them,
rather than actually express this love directly, our children grow up
addicted to material possessions. Because we teach them wrong from right
by withholding affection, they grow up needing rules and regulations,
overly concerned with control and personal power.
Because they don't adequately experience
affection, they grow up craving fame and adoration. And this is
principally happening because we experienced the same conditioning when
we were children ourselves."
Introduction
"Meanwhile we shall express our darker
purpose"
- King Lear, Act 1:Sc1.
The purpose of this piece is to introduce the
reader to the possibility that much of what we typically believe about our
world, notably its history and its political structure, may be some distance
from the truth.
In writing it is not my intention to reveal some vast,
secret government or destiny, but simply to allow interested readers to
indulge themselves in the exercise of re-evaluating just what is going on
around us.
Whether or not anyone chooses to believe the
scenario portrayed is entirely up to him or her. I make no categorical
statements about "how the world is" because our interpretation of our world
and the events of our lives is ultimately subjective.
In presenting this alternative interpretation of our world, I have simply
gone straight into the "conspiracy theory" version of history with scant
regard for quite viable alternative explanations for much of what has
happened in recent years.
Put simply, I have for the purpose of this
exercise quite deliberately selected the most negative explanation or
outcome for any series of events portrayed. If the reader finds following
this piece stressful, then I advise him or her to always keep in mind that
there are many other ways of looking at our world and, even if the
"worst-case scenario" were true, then simply recognizing the problem would
quickly bring about its reversal.
This piece is split into four sections.
-
The first section consists of a basic
overview of our recent history and possible destiny from the
perspective of an increasingly popular "conspiracy theory."
-
The second looks at the means by which
such a plan might be being kept from our awareness.
-
The third examines some basic concepts
that can be put to use in the manipulation of large population
groups.
-
And the fourth looks at what believers
or concerned citizens might do to hijack this process.
People from a wide variety of backgrounds are
increasingly willing to take seriously the notion that much of what we are
taught of our history is some distance from the truth.
In accordance with
classic "conspiracy theory" beliefs, they believe that the degree of
randomness ascribed to much of what has happened in the last few centuries
is excessive, and that, behind the scenes, a coherent negative force is
manipulating the events of our lives for its own ends.
It is believed that there exists an "elite cabal" at the apex of banking and
industry, operating through government and the media, and controlling our
political, social and personal lives to ever-increasing degrees.
This elite group has been pursuing its ambitions
for centuries and is operating to an agenda entirely not in our interest. It
has ruthlessly manipulated the political landscape via the strategic
destabilization and reorganization of nation states; and its ultimate
objective is to take the incredibly diverse range of human cultures once
existing on Earth and slowly mould them into a single, homogenized trading
and consuming block under their centralized control.
The principal means by which it is believed this group is seeking to do this
is via the expansion of their own developmental prototype for world culture
- America; a set of cultural values that is systematically being expanded
across the world, progressively eliminating a wealth of ancient peoples and
beliefs, and leaving in their place a standardized, consumerist stereotype.
The ultimate goal of this proposed elite group is to bring about a single
global marketplace, controlled by a world government, policed by a world
army, financially regulated by a world bank via a single global currency,
and populated by a microchipped population connected to a global computer, a
computer that both monitors and updates our personal location and financial
status, and regulates our emotional state via transmitted electrical signals
- technology that already exists.
This ambition of thus rendering the Earth a planet under complete control -
a self-contained, interactive social structure
under total centralized
control - is chiefly being pursued via activities in two areas - commerce
and culture.
In "commerce," the elite group have created the corporations,
the vehicles for total control of the planet, and in "culture," the elite
group have created both the drivers and passengers of those vehicles - us.
The historical roots of this "elite group" stretch back into the mists of
time. But the development of the modern banking system in Middle Ages Europe
provides a useful starting point for a look at their activities.
The reader should note that, in describing the
activities of this proposed elite cabal, I have had to give them a name,
that name usually being simply "the elite."
Part One - The World
Outside
A Brief History of Banking
"Let me issue and control a nation's
money and I care not who writes the laws"
- Amshall Rothschild
In the recent era, the story of "the elite"
commences with the development of the modern banking system in Middle Ages
Europe. At that time, disposable wealth was usually held in the form of gold
or silver bullion.
For safety, such assets were kept in the safe of
the local goldsmith, he usually being the only individual who had a vault on
his premises. The goldsmith would issue a receipt for the deposit and, to
undertake financial transactions, the buyer would withdraw his gold and give
it to the seller, who would then deposit it again, frequently with the same
goldsmith.
As this was a time-consuming process, it became
common practice for people to simply exchange smiths' receipts when
conducting financial transactions. As time passed, the goldsmiths began to
issue receipts for specific values of gold, making buying and selling easier
still.
The smiths' receipts thus became the first
banknotes.
The goldsmiths, now fledgling bankers, noticed that at any one time only a
small proportion of the gold held with them was being withdrawn. So they hit
upon the idea of issuing more of the receipt notes themselves, notes that
did not refer to any actual deposited wealth.
By giving these receipts to people seeking
capital, in the form of loans, the goldsmiths could use the money deposited
with them by others to make money for themselves. It was found that, for
every unit of gold held by the goldsmith, ten times the sum could be safely
issued as notes without anyone usually becoming any the wiser. If a
goldsmith held, say, 100 pounds of other people's gold in his vaults, he
could issue banknotes to the value of 1000 pounds.
As long as no more than 10 percent of the
holders of those notes wanted their gold at any one time, no one would
realize the fraud being perpetrated. This practice, known as "fractional
reserve lending," continues to this day and is actually the backbone of the
modern banking industry.
Banks typically loan ten times their actual
financial holdings, meaning 90% of the money they lend does not now, never
has, and never will exist.
Loans issued by the goldsmiths had to be paid back to them with interest,
meaning non-existent money slowly became converted to tangible assets in the
form of goods and labor. Should the loan be defaulted upon, the banker had
the right to seize the defaulter's property. As time passed, therefore, the
goldsmiths became wealthier and wealthier.
They had devised a scheme to
create money out of thin air and then convert this money into real goods,
labor, or property. A loan of money at 12% interest recouped not merely 12%
for the banker, but 112%, as it does to this day.
As the industrial era began, so the potential for furthering this scheme
increased exponentially. The goldsmiths were now fully-fledged bankers, and
their ability to create money out of thin air and then convert it into
tangible assets enabled them to begin to control whole industries to the
point where the worlds of banking and industry became, to all intents and
purposes, seamless entities.
Extended family banking structures, such as
the Rothschilds, acquired so much power in this manner that the various
monarchies and fledgling governments of the time soon began to seem quite
feeble by comparison.
To increase their power and influence still further, these elite banking
families would subtly buy influence within governments or monarchies and
utilize this influence to strategically stir up unrest between nations. When
the inevitable disputes broke out, they would then lend vast sums of money,
usually to both sides, so that war could be waged.
Any armaments purchased would be those
manufactured by the industrial wing of the banking-industrial cartel, and by
regulating the loan of money and the timing of the delivery of weapons, the
outcome of any conflict could effectively be controlled. If deemed
necessary, monarchies and governments could further be destabilized by
generating poverty through regulating the money supply, and by using
agent-provocateur tactics to fuel any latent desire for revolution.
With such power it was easy to control the
fledgling governments of Europe and ensure that only those politicians who
would do the will of the banking families came to power.
As the twentieth century dawned, the banking families hit upon a new means
to consolidate and increase their gains. They discovered that by
periodically restricting the money supply, crashes within the emergent stock
exchanges of the world could easily be engineered.
The most notable example
of this was the famous Wall Street Crash of 1929.
What the history books
usually fail to record is that, in a crash, wealth is not actually
destroyed, but merely transferred. The "Crash of '29" allowed the most
powerful of the banking and industrial families to absorb the weaker
elements, generating even greater levels of centralized control.
As the technological revolution progressed, so the buying up of TV stations
and newspapers allowed the creation and control of the mass media.
This served to ensure that only a portrayal of
events that suited the interests of the elite banking families would get to
public attention - invariably one that all but denied their very existence.
A Closer Look at Government
The vision we're usually given of how political power is manifest in our
society typically runs something like this: government at the top, banking,
industry, media and military, beneath, and the people beneath this.
However,
an independent examination of the development of modern political power is
more likely to reveal the following arrangement: extended family banking
groups at the top, government beneath, facilitating the wishes of this
hierarchy, and the media beneath portraying the work of the government to
the people as "democracy in action."
It can thus be seen that, in truth, most governments are little more than
front organizations for the elite banking cartels. They interface with the
public via the media, acting to facilitate social change in a manner that
maintains relative social stability, while ensuring that our culture stays
in line with any course the elite wish it to pursue.
Western governments do not usually allow the
public to actually pick who becomes their political representative, merely
to choose between individuals selected by the party hierarchy.
Neither do the public get to pick the policies
the representative will pursue, this is also under the control of the party.
To say that this system is open to abuse is a considerable understatement.
America
The creation of the United States of America represents the pinnacle of the
elite's ambitions for world domination. America is, in essence, a prototype
for world consumer culture.
By encouraging a broad base of racial groups to
settle and develop under their constant control, the banking families have
been able to slowly direct the natural evolution of a form of social order
that humans from any background can adapt to, without a significant number
of them becoming sufficiently dissociated to actually take up arms and
overthrow the system.
This is aided by a highly repressive justice
system and backed by the largest prison population on the planet. Now that
the technological revolution has facilitated the expression of American
cultural values across the world, America is, in effect, expanding until the
50 states actually encompass the whole globe in all but name. Our planet is
slowly becoming America.
America is the ultimate control fantasy - consensual incarceration - whole
groups of people slowly driven to believe that there exists no way of
securely living together other than by the giving up of personal freedom bit
by bit.
World War II
The Second World War, a conflict which cost the lives of tens of millions of
people, was entirely manipulated into being by the elite banking and
industrial cartels.
Hitler rose to power in a country so economically crippled by the
reparations imposed after the previous war that going into another should
have been inconceivable. But the banking elite agreed to the loan of
billions of dollars, and furthermore set up a vast industrial complex within
Germany, (much of it the Standard Oil subsidiary,
I.G. Farben), to manufacture the tanks,
planes, arms and munitions necessary to wage another European war.
Oil pipelines and factories were built, lines of
credit extended and the war machine spent nearly a whole decade churning out
weaponry while the rest of the country remained in abject poverty thus
fueling the desire for war. The whole thing was a set up from start to
finish, as even a cursory independent examination will confirm.
The millions of deaths that resulted were looked
upon by the banking families as being simply a sacrifice necessary to
achieve greater levels of European homogeny and control.
The Third World
"Conquered states.... can be held by the
conqueror in three different ways.
The first is to ruin them, the second
for the conqueror to go and reside there in person and the third is to
allow them to continue to live under their own laws, subject to a
regular tribute, and to create in them a government of the few who will
keep the country friendly to the conqueror."
- Niccolo Machiavelli
The Prince
I will now look at the banking families'
ambitions in the Southern Hemisphere, or so-called "Third World."
All across
Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America, the elite banking families have
again pursued unrelentingly the ambition of destabilizing a multitude of
traditional cultures and creating in their place a series of homogenized
trading blocks. In recent years this task has been undertaken chiefly by the
World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But the story commences many years before.
Colonization by the European empire builders from the sixteenth century
onwards and the later granting of "independence" to conquered territories
led slowly to the forging of individual nation states with monarchies and
governments.
To ensure that these institutions remained
subservient to the elite, agent provocateurs and dubious Western government
agencies worked behind the scenes to displace any leaders who showed
democratic tendencies and replace them with elite puppets from local
communities and their extended families.
To maintain these hated and corrupt
regimes in power, the Western banking institutions lent vast sums of money
to these "governments" and monarchies to enable them to form armies,
frequently with foreign troops, and thus prevent the people of the country
from wresting power.
Loans were further granted for the purchase of
weapons, to wage various regional conflicts stirred up by elite agent
provocateurs, and to build palatial homes in which the puppet monarchs and
their officials might reside.
In the early 1970s, the elite-manipulated Yom Kippur war resulted in a
massive rise in oil prices. The whole world found itself paying vastly
increased rates for petroleum, and the massive profits made by the
oil-producing nations were invested back with the elite-controlled Western
banks. Relying on the ever-popular tactic of loaning at least ten times
their reserves, the banks now had insane sums of money to lend.
With the "Third World" countries compelled to
pay vastly increased sums for their oil, as well as service the debts
already incurred by their puppet leaders, further massive loans were
advanced to them in a banking strategy that came to be known as "petrodollar
recycling."
The Western banks would send youthful reps across the world
offering gigantic loans to anyone in power who wanted them. These loans
were, of course, created out of thin air and tied to the recipient buying
weapons, machinery or goods from the industrial or military clients of the
banking cartel offering the money.
In the 1980s, the bubbles began to burst, with
the Mexican debt crisis becoming the first of many "days of reckoning." The
World Bank and the IMF, elite-manufactured organizations created in the
1940s to "stimulate the conditions of world trade," stepped in.
They offered
"adjustments",
strategies for repayment that involved the countries
concerned adopting economic "austerity" programs and commencing industrial
production of Western goods and consumer products.
To commence industrial production, the countries had to take out further
loans and buy plant from - the industrial clients of the banking cartels.
To
generate sufficient power for the new industries, they had to hire companies
to build hydroelectric power plants or nuclear reactors - companies that
were again the heavy industry clients of the banking cartels.
The IMF debt-rescheduling practices enforced on the countries experiencing
major problems paying back their loans (problems entirely generated by the
elite via their control of world interest rates and oil prices) compelled
the "Third World" nations, one after another, to commence manufacturing
goods, not for themselves but for sale on the world markets.
Here, in the emergent global marketplace, they
had to compete with each other in a highly competitive market over which
they had no control. The only factor in the IMF equation that the Southern
Hemisphere countries could control was the cost of labor. The result was
cheaper goods for Western consumers and greater poverty for workers in the
"Third World."
All across the Southern Hemisphere, small farmers were driven away from
planting crops for themselves and compelled to plant crops for export,
hoping they'd get paid enough to survive.
In the 1980s, runaway inflation
stimulated by Reaganomics in America (the arrangement of vast loans
for US government spending on military and space projects that sent world
interest rates skyrocketing) began to force many local people out of the
countryside altogether. They were driven into the newly created cities where
they vied with each other for work in the newly built factories.
This led to the destruction of traditional ways
of life for millions upon millions.
Emergent
drug cartels,
invariably under
the direction of government agencies such as the CIA, began to flood the
cities and industrial areas with cheap drugs, hooking those with jobs deeper
into a life of wage slavery, and those without into lifelong street-level
delinquency. In addition, grain crops, previously used for bread, were
diverted into producing of alcohol for the relocated populations.
Problems unheard of a generation before -
alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, unemployment, poverty and malnutrition -
became epidemic in proportion all across Africa, Latin America and Southeast
Asia. In Brazil, one of the biggest food exporters in the world, approaching
half a million children die annually from malnutrition or hunger-related
diseases.
In the early 1990s, the specter of capitalist greed proved increasingly
disturbing for the people buying the goods created in this manner.
So the
elite came up with "green-washing" -
the media-driven means by which images
of change within the Southern Hemisphere are bombarded upon the Western
viewer, convincing them that "the system" is adapting to moral pressure from
Western citizens.
News broadcasts accepted that previous practices
had been exploitative but that, post Live Aid and similar, things were
changing and any residual problems were entirely the fault of the poorer
nations themselves or the weather.
The previous "evil capitalists," the Reagans
and Thatchers, were removed from power and replaced by
consumer-friendly mouthpieces of the elite - the Clintons and the
Blairs.
On UK TV at the time of writing (originally Spring 2000), one
BBC program features former Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell,
entering the world's shanty towns and meeting crowds of poor but
happy-looking children jumping up and down, thus generally promoting the
image of gradual change and improvement.
What the program neglected to
reveal is that, in many of the "Third World's" shantytowns, children now
have less than a 50% chance of making it to their first birthday.
Infant mortality rates are rising steadily
throughout the Southern Hemisphere, despite the efforts of
The
United Nations (UN) and World Health Organization (WHO)
to massage the figures.
For those lucky enough to reach the grand old age of
five, the only prospect to look forward to is a life of begging, street
crime or child prostitution. The population of the world is currently
estimated at six billion. Three billion of these are existing in poverty,
one third of them at near-starvation level.
For the majority of the world's citizens, life
is now demonstrably worse than at any time in recorded history.
The Future - Chips with Everything?
In the passages above, I've looked at a few aspects of our recent history
with the intention of demonstrating that there may be a pattern of
organization in the background that could give many people grounds for
concern.
At this point, I would now like to address the
question:
"If there really was a coherent body
organizing all of this, what would their motivation be, and where might
all this be leading?"
The primary motivation behind all elite
activities is the desire to acquire control.
It is the base desire to
control everything, to take a vast and dynamic planet full of people and
drive them into a single cultural structure under their central control. It
is the fulfillment of this desire that truly motivates the elite. In their
attempt to bring about this highly negative state of affairs, the elite need
to be active on two fronts simultaneously - the world outside and the world
inside, the planet and the mind.
In the "world outside," the objective the banking families are working
towards is globalization - the creation of three vast interlocked markets
centered on America, Europe and Asia, followed by their full integration
into a single trading block.
A global marketplace peopled with
consumer-workers and serviced at the lower end via "Third World" debt.
In the "world inside," the plan is to
get all humanity microchipped. For, despite a multiplicity of
control tactics currently being imposed upon us - mortgages, credit cards,
street surveillance systems and antidepressants among them - people still
have a basic level of personal freedom. Although it's getting harder to do
so, we can still walk out of consumerism and embark on a new life.
But if we are chipped this won't happen.
This is because scientists' knowledge of
neuroscience is now such that, by having a tiny microchip implanted inside
our body, we can be regulated at an emotional level.
By gaining control over
our body's receptor-ligand network, our emotional state can be manipulated
by electrical signals, either as a part of a chip's program or via remote
signaling, thus offering the possibility of the creation of a perfect
consumer workforce - a people whose only thoughts are those of working,
eating, procreating and sleeping.
However, despite the progress our planet has made along the road of becoming
a world consumerist superstate, most people are still highly resistant to
the idea of having a chip put under their skin. There is therefore a
progressive strategy that will be gradually implemented to lead us, step by
step, into permitting this nightmare future to come about.
It will unfold in three concurrent stages.
-
Firstly, cash will be gradually
eliminated.
-
Secondly, all personal and financial data will be placed on
individual "smartcards."
-
And, thirdly smartcards will be themselves
gradually eliminated to be replaced by microchip implants.
By first removing
cash, then introducing problems into electronic money systems while
simultaneously promoting microchip implants as a safe and acceptable
alternative, the elite will lead us slowly into accepting personal implant
technology.
I will look more closely at how these three stages will likely
unfold.
For the past twenty years we have been slowly led towards giving up cash in
favor of electronic money, and in the last ten, the heat has been turned up.
The increased promotion of credit cards, phone banking, mail order and
Internet shopping have all helped to bring about a society where the need
for cash transactions is greatly reduced. Yet many people still like
carrying cash, meaning more will have to be done if it is to be eliminated
completely.
One strategy that will be employed will be the gradual implementation of
"smart citizenship" schemes across ever-widening sectors of our society.
"Smart citizenship" is one of a variety of euphemisms now emerging for
"cashless society" and, once one city has been signed up, the benefits can
be extensively promoted by the media to encourage others to follow suit.
In April 2000 it was announced that the UK city
of Southampton and the Swedish city of Gothenberg will host smart
citizenship schemes commencing 2002, to be technically facilitated by the
French consortium,
Schlumberger.
Another strategy that might be utilized is the introduction of new,
multinational currencies not available as cash. The Euro, the currency for
the European Union, may well be such a thing.
Another possibility is that cash will be removed on the pretext of
eliminating the illicit drug trade. Many cities now have around 1% of their
population using heroin daily. This, along with crack cocaine addiction, is
proving a near intolerable social burden for many people who live in the
areas affected. If cash were eliminated, anonymous illicit transactions for
small sums would not be possible.
With electronic money, the identities of the
buyer and seller of any article are recorded on computer and, should a
transaction be for an illicit substance, it could be traced. Although
illicit drugs come into our countries in vast shipments, each load is
ultimately sold in small amounts at or near street level.
Remove cash and
the illicit drug trade would be finished...
If the "drug war" is going to be used to assist in the outlawing of cash,
one of the first signs will likely be moves to legalize soft drugs like
marijuana. The smoking of cannabis is the primary cash-based illicit
activity that people indulge in, and the prospect of having this pleasure
withdrawn from them would inevitably create considerable opposition to any
plan to outlaw cash.
In addition, marijuana legalization would create
the appearance of policy-softening on behalf of government, when the
opposite is in fact taking place.
Whatever tactics are eventually employed, while cash is being eliminated and
the creation of a global society pursued, an assortment of "softening-up"
strategies are likely to be deployed by the media.
There will be a steady trickle of stories in the
papers and on TV relating the benefits of microchipping. Scientists
will make statements extolling the wonders of implant technology for
treating and monitoring illnesses and futuristic articles will relate how,
in a few years time, we won't have to carry wallets around.
Such stories
will invariably make it seem that microchipping and
globalization are not
only desirable but also inevitable - that they have already "been decided."
Once cash has finally been eliminated from a region, what will next happen
is that problems will begin to mysteriously occur within the electronic
money system. People will occasionally find their money disappearing into
thin air.
Computer errors, viruses and fraud, previously virtually unheard
of, will increasingly begin to manifest. Having your personal records placed
on a microchip implant will become renowned as the only safe way to keep
personal data safe from interference, likely because encryption technology
available on the personal chip won't be available on the smartcard.
Whole groups of people within society will likely have already been chipped
by this time. Criminals, the mentally ill, and military personnel are three
likely targets. The media will constantly portray chipping as the socially
positive thing to do.
Small children will go missing in high profile cases
on the daily news, then be found, "because they were chipped."
Young people's TV will be especially targeted.
Getting chipped will be seen as a cool thing to do, with a vast array of
different chip features available to order. Getting chipped will be seen as
synonymous with "getting ahead" and attracting members of the opposite sex.
The media will spare no effort ensuring that the negative aspects of getting
chipped, such as feeling like a robot, are driven from people's minds.
To still further intensify the drive to get the public chipped, large
corporations will begin to make it a requirement for employment, likely
under the guise of it being their contribution to creating a positive
society.
By this time the multinational corporations of
today, big as they already are, will have been transformed into
transnational giants, astride the world like statues of Colossus,
controlling vast sectors of the earth's resources and meeting them out
according to their masters' schedule, and with a vast and continuous PR job
making it all appear completely consensual.
Virtually everything purchased
will be from a multinational corporation, and nearly all employment
opportunities will involve working for one.
With cash gone and no way of bringing it back, and the credit card, ID card,
and even smartcard systems increasingly falling into disrepair, life will
begin to seem pretty bleak for those persons not chipped. Pretty soon, not
being chipped will effectively mean you are not capable of working for a
regular wage in any but the most menial job.
There will initially still be a large black
market operating at varying degrees outside the law and trading in a wide
variety of licit and illicit substances. But, as chipping proceeds all
across Western society, and becomes seen as being as natural as paying tax,
so the State will increasingly make moves to attack illicit activity.
With the moral backing of the microchipped
population, engineered by the media, those persons not chipped will
increasingly be marginalized in the same way the homeless are now - forced
to the edges of society and left to fend for themselves in an environment of
poverty, drug addiction, sexual exploitation and crime.
Once chipping is finally accepted as being an integral part of life in the
twenty-first century, the next stage will be implemented - the promotion of
chips that can regulate aspects of our body's function.
Self-regulation of our body and mind will be seen as a new and convenient
means of treating any number of complaints ranging from depression to minor
flesh wounds. No need to take tablets or call up the doctor, just program
your chip to do it for you. Scientists are now sufficiently knowledgeable of
our body's electrical system and ligand-receptor networks that they can
superficially alter many of our natural emotional functions.
By changing the
way our body metabolizes serotonin, for example, the symptoms of depression
can be relieved.
With chips available capable of altering a whole range of neurochemical
functions, we will increasingly have the ability to emotionally regulate
ourselves. Given that it is now well recognized that negative emotions are
mere symptoms of deeper needs not being met, all sorts of health problems
could easily go undiagnosed.
But, apart from health concerns, giving people
the means to easily emotionally self-regulate could lead to the "Prozac
generation" becoming global. People will become obsessed with feeling good
about themselves all the time, ignoring anything which threatens to
interfere with that feeling. Wars, starvation, political upheavals and
global tyranny will all become just "other people's problems."
With implant technology accepted as being part
of life in the twenty-first century,
-
Who is going to notice if one day the
chips seem to start regulating themselves.
-
Who is going to notice if they no
longer require us to actually program them, but seem to do it without our
help, no longer allowing us access to our true feelings even if we wanted
them?
This nightmare scenario seems like something out of science fiction but, in
fact, much of the technology has already been developed.
The implantable
microchip with global tracking system and biomonitoring system,
Digital
Angel, is scheduled to go into production in late 2000, (see later). It is
powered by human muscle movement and will be offered to people concerned
that they or their loved ones may go missing and to doctors wanting to
monitor their patients.
Patents for implantable chips that release
pharmaceuticals into the bloodstream have already been issued and companies,
such as
ChipRx, have been set up to develop them
for the market.
ChipRX Self Regulating Respective Therapeutic System
The technology is here, the only question is:
how much persuading will be necessary to make us accept it?
One thing is
certain - everything will be done bit by bit.
Step by step, we will be led into a place where
no one, if they thought about it, would ever willingly go - and without
means of escape.
Part Two - The World
Inside
"The psychological rule says that when an
individual remains unaware of the divisions within, the world he
experiences must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing
halves"
- Carl Jung
Hiding the Plot
If one imagines for a moment that the world is being run by an elite cabal
at the apex of banking and industry, one might legitimately inquire as to
how such a group might have prevented us from discovering their true level
of power.
We are intelligent and inquisitive creatures by nature, craving
input and stimulation, and it would appear impossible that a truth of this
magnitude could be hidden from us for such a length of time.
As I hope to demonstrate, it is actually quite straightforward. The
"conditioning" process that most of us undergo in the course of a normal
Western childhood not only causes us to divert from our natural behavior but
also permanently alters the way most of us evaluate information.
In the second section of this piece I shall be
looking at how a typical Western childhood can subconsciously render us:
addicted to material pleasures and the quest for personal power, resistant
to information which contradicts what we believe we already know, and
impervious to natural self-healing - and all without most of us becoming any
the wiser.
Conditioning
Conditioning is the means by which our reaction to traumatic events can be
put to use to cause us to permanently alter our natural behavior. Parents
usually condition their children by giving them affection when their
behavior is deemed "good" and withholding affection when it is deemed "bad."
They do this because the overwhelming majority
of cultural influences they are exposed to tell them it must be done or we
will not grow up to be "civilized" human beings.
The action of conditioning, when it first
occurs, will cause the mind to repress - to block awareness of what it was
that happened. This will reoccur the first few times the action of
conditioning, for instance, slapping, occurs. Then the mind will learn. It
will learn that, in order to avoid being slapped in future, it must
undertake the change in behavior required.
However, in order for
conditioning to take place, the memory and pain associated with the original
act of conditioning must remain repressed within, blocked from our
awareness.
The intention of the mind, in blocking our awareness of events and
repressing any associated emotions, is to protect us from emotional damage
in our formative years. Each time something happens around us that in any
way reminds our subconscious mind of a repressed memory, we receive a little
burst of anxiety as repressed emotions begin to be processed.
As repressed memories build up, whole areas of
natural thinking and behavior thus begin to become painful to us. The mind
deals with this by learning subconsciously to avoid situations that remind
it of repressed memories; and it is this "need to avoid" that allows the
conditioned mind to be so easily controlled.
By creating a culture in which
repressed pain is not released from the system but, instead, can merely be
avoided through social conformity, Western populations become emotionally
dependent on their culture to feel secure.
They can easily be directed to both do work and
follow a lifestyle that slowly draws the planet under centralized control.
The Persona
One means by which nearly all Westerners learn to avoid contact with
repressed emotions is through the development of a "persona."
The persona is
essentially a shield, a face that one can present to the world, behind which
one can interact with society free from the risk of experiencing repressed
pain. A consequence of developing this shield is that we, as children, start
to learn to mask our true needs behind symbolic needs.
We naturally crave deep love and affection but
many learn not to seek it directly for fear of re-experiencing the pain that
results when it is denied. Instead, many of us grow up learning to crave
things that merely symbolize what we truly want, things like material
possessions, personal power, sensual pleasures, and fame.
Material possessions symbolize love because we learn that our parents show
us love by giving us things.
Personal power symbolizes love because it
represents freedom of expression, the withholding of which was used to
condition us. Sensual pleasures symbolize love because we associate intimacy
with love.
Fame symbolizes love because we associate
adoration with love. All these cravings are for things that symbolically
represent what we truly need but are not the actual need itself. Because the
true needs are not being met, the pleasure experienced proves only temporary
and the craving for more symbols of love quickly returns.
This is the true
root of the universal problem of greed. The child chasing mere symbols of
its true wants becomes the adult doing the same. We thus grow up driven to
seek out things that merely symbolize what we actually want, and so never
experience lasting satisfaction.
When we don't comprehend the root of our
behavior, we simply assume that we don't have enough and strive for more.
School
Our school years are a time when we should be opening up emotionally,
learning about the world and understanding what it means to be alive.
Instead, most people's experience of school is that of being subjected to a
rigorous indoctrination process while immersed in an emotionally repressive
environment.
An atmosphere of inhibition and abuse pervades,
and fear of ridicule from our peer group causes us to spend most of our time
hiding our true feelings and directing our energy into maintaining face.
Our shield, our persona, is maintained by self-esteem. Experiencing a
feeling of security within the peer group is vital if the persona is to be
held in place.
To experience embarrassment in front of one's peers will
instantly expose the individual to deeply painful repressed emotions, and
thus is something to be avoided at all costs. One result of this is a
corruption of our innate need to understand the nature of our world.
For, from now on, whether or not we accept what
we learn as being true will depend not only on whether it makes sense but
also on whether we feel that believing it might pose a threat to our place
within the peer group.
We thus become dependent on our beliefs not only to
help us understand the world but also to help maintain our persona. It is
natural therefore that we soon develop a deep need to agree with the taught
versions of subjects such as history and science.
For not to do so would invite ridicule, and thus
lead to a re-experiencing of deeply negative repressed feelings.
The Persona and Social Conformity
Our developing of this "need to agree" explains why the overwhelming
majority of us appear so happy to go along with convention and popular
belief, and are therefore resistant to "conspiracy theories."
In fact, even
when reading a controversial article in a journal, something that offers
little chance of us actually being hurt, the subconscious mind remains
constantly on the lookout for anything that could potentially affect our
self-image, constantly aware of our need to maintain face.
Should it encounter something threatening, it
will quickly try to dump the information and move on to something else, not
bothering to engage the rational mind and evaluate the idea further.
We can see how dangerous this is when we look at how little most people
challenge the accepted version of history. Of World War II, for example, we
are typically taught that Hitler was an evil dictator who rose to power in
Germany and sought to take over the world.
This provoked a reaction from the
Allies, which, while causing a massive and regrettable loss of life, was
unfortunately necessary if the world was to be saved from a global fascist
regime.
-
But how many of us ask how it was that Hitler,
the leader of a country so economically crippled that a wheelbarrow full of
banknotes was needed to purchase a mere loaf of bread, could afford the
immense cost of all-out European war?
-
How was it that the German army could
secure the vast and continuing supply of oil and armaments necessary to
undertake war on so many fronts simultaneously?
The answer, of course, is
that it was loaned the money necessary by the banking and industrial cartels
of the West.
Yet most people reading this will not bother to enquire further into this
story. Instead they will rapidly discount the whole idea on the first
pretext that enters their mind.
This is because, working at a subconscious
level, our mind has already worked out that, if we believe that World War II
was entirely manipulated into being by elite groups, then we are going to
have to believe that other events in our history may have been similarly
manipulated, and if we do this, it knows that we are going to have to adopt
a set of beliefs that is different from that of our peers, thus potentially
exposing us to ridicule.
The need to hold down pain is greater than the
need to know the truth and so defensive functions deny us the ability to
rationally assess controversial information.
Now let's look more deeply at this process.
Emotional Hijacking
In the 1990s, author
Daniel Goleman memorably coined the term "emotional
hijacking" to describe the process by which one part of our mind, operating
below the level of our conscious awareness, can "hijack" our
information-processing facilities and cause us to act irrationally,
invariably in situations that it believes could be threatening to us.
Emotional hijacking refers to the ability of lower parts of the mind - our
instincts, drives and defense mechanisms - to dictate the activity of the
higher parts - our facilities for analysis, deduction and creativity.
While
we have developed a brain with quite phenomenal processing power, it is
still subservient to our more primitive needs, and if what the higher brain
is processing begins to concern our defense functions, then subconscious
processes cut in and hijack intellectual activity, directing the mind to
simply move away from the lines of thought that are inducing anxiety.
Now
let's look at what this process of emotional hijacking means in practice.
Please read the following:
"Builders excavating the site of Benjamin
Franklin's former London residence recently discovered 10 corpses, four
adult and six children. They were subsequently dated as coming from
around the same period as his occupation.
Some claim that this proves
further that Franklin, known to be involved with various elitist Masonic
groups, as well as the UK's notorious Hellfire Club, was a practicing
Satanist who had participated in child sacrifices."
On reading the above piece, many of us will
experience an immediate, knee-jerk desire to laugh - to ridicule the absurd
notion of Ben Franklin having been a Satanist and to have participated in
child sacrifices.
Why should this be?
To persons brought up to believe that Benjamin
Franklin was a loyal American and founding father, surely the natural
reaction should be one of anger or outrage at such an assertion. Yet many of
us will experience instead the urge to ridicule.
This reaction is merely the defensive response
described above. As we processed the last lines of the short article, a
lower part of our brain suddenly became activated and leapt in to hijack the
higher parts, all without our being aware.
Believing that Benjamin Franklin
might have been a Satanist will potentially expose us to ridicule, and so it
acts quickly to prevent this happening and ridicules the notion itself. Note
that this exercise is not making any statements about Benjamin Franklin,
merely demonstrating how easily our higher mind is controlled by the lower.
Another important route for emotional hijacking is the shift into analytical
thinking. If, while processing information, the lower brain begins to become
concerned about deductions being made, it can direct the higher mind to seek
alternative ways to account for what is presented.
This is of course a natural part of the analysis
process, but here it is being done, not to further understanding, but to
block the formation of anxiety-inducing deductions.
The difference is that,
when analysis is done to block deductive reasoning, a person will develop an
emotional need to believe his or her interpretation is correct. He or she
will become emotionally, rather than intellectually, biased towards one
viewpoint.
Now, let's look at the third and most damaging
way our natural development of a persona comes to affect our life.
Learning to Deny Our Pain
In addition to the way the persona can render us reliant on consumer
culture, and cause us to believe only the mainstream interpretation of
history, so it also prevents from us realizing what has happened to us.
For,
when we operate from behind a persona, we must resist any attack on our
self-esteem.
This means we must oppose any suggestion that we
have been in any way negatively affected by the experiences of our
childhood.
We saw earlier that, in order to release
ourselves from the negative effects of repressed material, we must become
consciously aware of its existence, express the pain, and so commence the
grieving process. Yet, while we are constantly engaged in maintaining face,
we cannot begin to come to terms with what has happened to us and thus begin
to heal ourselves.
In emotional terms, life becomes a simple feedback loop.
Because we have been conditioned, we cannot face
the notion that conditioning has affected us. And because we cannot face the
notion that conditioning has affected us, we cannot heal ourselves of its
effects. And we thus go on to condition others. The conditioning of children
is central to all elite activities in Europe and the US, and is always done
on the pretext of rendering them "civilized."
Once one generation of children has grown up
conditioned, you have the raw material that can be directed to go out and
enslave other cultures on your behalf.
Part Three - Achieving
Total Control
In this section I will look more closely at how the elite is attempting to
achieve total control, firstly in terms of principles and symbolism, and
then via actual examples.
Knowledge is power.
Exploiting people is very simple when you have a little
more knowledge than they do. And while our knowledge of many things these
days is impressive, there are areas where we are deeply lacking. It is
because we do not understand how important emotions are and how subconscious
needs will always try and get themselves met that we become so controlled by
repressed emotions.
And it is because the majority do not know what the
minority know that so many end up being controlled by so few. Many of the
principles used by the elite are already familiar to us, albeit in a
different form.
But it is the ones that we are not aware of that
are being used so effectively to control us.
Pyramids
The pyramid represents a form of political or social structure that allows a
small group of individuals to control a much larger group. If you imagine a
pyramid split up into ascending levels, you have the basic model. At each
level up, there are fewer people but greater power.
The pyramid power
structure is found all over Western culture.
Corporations and government bodies classically
use this structure to manage their activities. At each level on the
promotional ladder, there is greater power. And when one gets to the top,
the entire structure can be controlled on one's own. When setting up these
hierarchical power structures, the elite will invariably design an
organization to initially have a benign social function.
Once it has power, its role can then be
progressively changed such that it begins to forward a hidden agenda when
the time is right.
Imbalance and Disconnection
In addition to utilizing the forces represented by the pyramid, the elite
also work extensively with the power of "imbalance."
This is done by vastly
overemphasizing one side of a structure that is naturally resolved into two
seemingly opposed parts - the male over the female, conservatism over
liberalism, reductionism over holism, and so on.
This has the effect of generating deep
imbalances within the human psyche, and our innate desire to return to a
state of wholeness can be put to use to further negative ends. In order that
this principle is effective, we need to be led into believing that the state
of imbalance is natural.
This is done via yet another well-known
principle - the principle of disconnection.
From the middle ages onwards, Westerners have sold us the lie that their
culture derives almost entirely from Ancient Greece, when in truth it is
intimately connected with the ancient cultures of the Middle East, India and
the Orient. By creating this disconnection from our true past, the elite can
impose their vision of culture upon us, including our belief that overtly
one-sided structures are our cultural norm.
And, because we consciously believe that the
culture that surrounds us is natural when it is in fact only half the story,
the subconscious mind is driven to seek out a state of wholeness that it
feels must exist somewhere. People experience a constant feeling that
"something is missing," and this feeling can be put to use in the ongoing
quest for total control of the planet, as we shall see at the end of this
chapter.
In addition, by creating the illusion that Western culture springs from just
one source, the elite are also free to utilize other people's knowledge to
forward their own aims without the masses realizing its true significance.
The esoteric principles we have been looking at
derive from ancient Eastern and Middle Eastern cultures, and are being used
to control us while we actually ridicule their very existence and our
scientists expend much energy trying to prove they are not so!
Which brings us to science.
Science
Science is a field in which the elite have been particularly active. In
order to keep hidden knowledge to themselves, and thus be free to exploit it
to the maximum, the elite had to find a means to keep others away from its
study.
This was done by establishing a school of thought that would draw the
emergent learned classes of Renaissance Europe away from ancient esoteric
principles and instead lead them into developing the technologies the elite
could use to exploit natural forces for their own ends.
This school of
thought would become known simply as "science."
Science is essentially a philosophy of measurement based around the
principles of empiricism, or experimentation, and objectivity, the
reproducibility of this experimentation. Science, as we know it today,
became established with the elite's creation of the Royal Society in 1640s
London.
In helping to make popular this new and
objective "science," the elite achieved two vital aims.
-
Firstly, the significance of esoteric
knowledge became progressively hidden from view and thus slowly
disregarded by the masses.
-
Secondly, the forces of the material
world could progressively be harnessed by the elite as more and more
learned men and women were drawn into pursuing this study.
To reinforce this new science's ability to
merely manipulate natural forces, the principle of reductionism was also
vastly emphasized over its counterpart, contextualism, or holism.
Reductionism is a scientific philosophy which espouses that something can be
understood by examination of its constituent parts as opposed to its
function.
What the founders of the Royal Society knew, that our scientists today do
not, was that the process of formulating scientific laws based upon
objective experimentation, the basis of science, would not easily reveal
true insights into the nature of our existence. Implicit to the esoteric
model is the need for systematic and sustained subjective analysis in
addition to objective evaluation.
Science's emphasis on the objective over
the subjective therefore actually renders it essentially impotent as a tool
by which we can truly learn about our world.
The media unrelentingly promote science as some form of search for "the
truth," and frequently debase ideas on the grounds that they are "unproven."
Yet, as philosophers of science from Plato to A.N. Whitehead have pointed
out, science is in no way a search for the truth, but is merely the
establishment of a means of interpreting our world from one perspective.
"Proof" is actually a quite meaningless concept
in many ways for, conceptually, only certain types of ideas can be
empirically proven, and then only within one, very limited mental framework.
Sadly, very few scientists are aware of this, and so the majority go on
believing that the attributes of empiricism and objectivity confer some
special status to their studies.
The reality is that science is merely one
branch of philosophy, and whether people believe it or not depends not on
some innate validity it might possess but simply on what the majority have
been told is "the truth."
Einstein and others eventually demonstrated that the principles on which
empiric science was founded were actually invalid.
But, long before this, esotericists were aware that what actually mattered was whether people
believed science or not. They knew that the pursuit of a science based on
empiricism, objectivity, and reductionism could not easily lead anyone to
freedom, but that a person brought up to believe in the absolute validity of
science would develop a mindset that blocked recognition of this.
Yet, even taking into account the conceptual problems, science could still
lead to much technology that would free many sectors of society.
Effective
medications that actually address the cause of illnesses, as opposed to
merely temporarily relieving symptoms, and
free energy applications are two
good examples.
And so the elite continue to exert immense power
over how modern science develops via a variety of "establishment" bodies in
government, education and the private sector. By ensuring that funding for
research goes only goes where they want it, the elite thus ensure that
science uncovers only that which is beneficial to their deeper purpose.
Now let's look at how esoteric scientific
beliefs are put to work by the elite.
Thinking and Control
The power of thought is well respected in among the controlling elite.
Indeed, our thoughts, especially those about ourselves in relation to
others, are recognized as being a vital source of energy that can be put to
work.
Encouraging selfishness has always made sense to
the elite. In the US, a specific social structure has been created wherein
the needs of the individual are seen as outweighing the needs of the group
to a degree that is unparalleled in modern history. The corrupted driving
instinct that naturally results from exposure to this system benefits the
elite in two ways.
Firstly, the desire to "get ahead" that an American upbringing is
specifically intended to induce can be put to work at a corporate level,
ensuring that the plan for world takeover proceeds at maximum pace. And
secondly, the elite believe that selfish thinking feeds back to them at a
psychic level and reinforces their hold on the planet.
This latter belief
arises because the controlling elite believe that fear, hatred, envy and
anger are all emotions that can be used to maintain a state of control over
people.
And this is reflected in many of the social and political structures
that have developed in the West.
Race relations, religion, local government and
service industry are all seen as fields where tension and fear can be
generated and put to work to help maintain control.
However, it is also well recognized that there are limits that must be
adhered to when negative emotions are being used to maintain control. For
esoteric thought holds that all emotions ultimately derive from love, and so
if anyone is driven too deeply into negativity they will discover salvation.
They recognize that the ideal state in which to
keep us is that of blamebelieving everything is our neighbor's fault, or
shamethat everything is our own fault.
Western Culture
Here we shall look at how some of the principles mentioned above have
actually been put into action.
-
Patriarchy
The level to which men dominate our culture accounts for many
of the problems our world now faces.
Women, being more intuitive than men,
are natural healers, and, given the chance, could quite likely resolve many
of the world's problems. Yet the overwhelming majority do not get the
opportunity to direct their natural healing ability to where it is needed.
Instead they find themselves constantly drawn to try and heal individuals
resistant to their efforts.
Many women who have been subjected to the
Western childhood, with its distant and frequently unloving father figures,
will find themselves constantly being subconsciously drawn into
relationships with certain types of men; men who represent the father who
didn't love them in the way their instincts told them he should.
By creating
a self-perpetuating patriarchy, the elite have successfully ensured that the
immense gifts all women carry are largely diverted away from where they
could do the most good and into fruitless and largely unrewarding sidelines.
-
Cell structure
Cell structure is what we have when we isolate elements of
a process, lots of little cells of activity side by side, each disconnected
from the next.
Cell structure is found all over Western society - in our
jobs, our habits, even in our minds. If Western consumers could see what
goes on in the Southern Hemisphere simply to bring cheap goods to their
tables they would be horrified.
But because the process is split up into
cells, it is easy to disconnect from the tragedy that is occurring behind
the scenes.
All across the Southern Hemisphere, relocated
populations are compelled to spend long hours churning out clothing in
subhuman conditions.
-
the people who ship the clothing to the West don't see
this because they just work in shipping
-
the people who sell the clothing
don't see this because they just work in sales
-
the people who market the
clothing don't see this because they just work in marketing
-
the people
who buy the clothing don't see this because they just see the result of all
the marketing.
Because the system is split up into cells, we
never realize the level of sheer human misery that goes into producing the
inexpensive, abundant goods that we take for granted.
-
Compartmentalization
Essentially, cell structure for the mind.
Many people
will be aware of the degree to which the media presentation of issues has
been standardized over the last decade or so. Slowly the media are being
drawn to present information, be it an ad for soap powder or a news
broadcast, in pretty much the same format all across the world.
This standardization of presentation, combined
with the ever-increasing amount of information that we are all now required
to process, has the effect of causing our minds to compartmentalize - to
split into cells.
In order to keep up with all the things that are happening
around us, we have to quickly assess incoming information and stick it away
in its own little compartment in our minds.
Read any newspaper article these days, or watch
any news broadcast, and you will find in the opening of the piece
information which helps us prepare emotionally and intellectually for what's
coming, and tells the mind which compartment to store it in.
Pretty soon
there will be so much information around that we will cease looking at
content at all and merely respond to these little intro "bytes."
All of the concepts found above are well-known to those schooled in ancient
esoteric thought as means by which natural forces can be harnessed and used
for one's own ends.
And by making sure that the masses remain blissfully
convinced that esoteric knowledge is all just superstitious nonsense, the
elite ensure that power remains theirs.
Having detailed some of the ways that ancient esoteric principals have been
put to work at a symbolic and actual level in our world, I will now return
to modern psychology and look at how the world of commerce is driving our
planet along the pathway to total control by the elite, with us at the
wheel!
Commerce, workers and consumption
Throughout this piece I have demonstrated how all the pain and fear
repressed within drives us away from our natural thinking and behavior and
allows us to be easily controlled.
Now I would like to expand upon this
concept and demonstrate how all the avoidance strategies we are driven to
undertake in our daily lives are actually starting to bring about the total
control scenario.
As we have seen, many of the daily decisions we take are taken to attempt to
fulfill a need that we are not aware exists.
We are constantly trying to
either protect ourselves from the thought that we are unlovable, to distract
ourselves from the thought that we are unlovable, or to recreate repressed
situations to "prove to ourselves" we are not unlovable; and with millions
upon millions of us all doing this, so the Western world is actually
starting to become just a mass of avoidance strategies.
We are each of us interpreting our world in a
way that allows us to avoid confrontation with repressed conflicts from our
past; and with a society based on supply and demand, so our planet is slowly
being compelled to facilitate all these avoidance strategies in order that
our minds can continue to hold down all the pain within.
This is why our world has become split between the North and the South.
People in the Northern Hemisphere end up enslaving people in the Southern
Hemisphere just so they can get things to help them get through the day. The
driving instincts and seeking behavior we adopt to keep pain and fear
repressed become translated into corporate ambition and consumer desires.
And so we are driven to undertake the
enslavement of the "Third World" in a desperate attempt to satisfy our
misdirected cravings.
It is by being brought up in the culture that the elite have manipulated
into being that we are driven to virtually enslave other races. And it is in
the vehicles the elite have created that we actually carry out this
enslavement.
By creating the vessels for control, the companies and later
the corporations, and the human positions within those vessels, the jobs and
the promotional ladder, the elite have evolved the means by which the whole
planet can be slowly be brought within their grasp.
The corporation is the driving force behind the dynamic "to control
everything." It is the machine that forcibly draws ever more of the planet's
resources under its control.
This driving entity sits embedded within a
culture of control - a self-sustaining, ever-expanding vortex of repression
that generates the people who will work for the corporation and leaves the
rest emotionally shipwrecked within a structure that either imprisons them
as worker-consumers or sidelines them without the means to effectively
rebel. (The latter as inmates of the prison system or mental institutions,
drug addicts, or the homeless.)
Emerging as new-born innately beautiful beings
from our mothers, our minds are so confused by the bewildering treatment we
receive that we allow ourselves to become our own jailers, and slowly, the
jailers of the planet.
And so we might look at three beautiful humans being born within our culture
and see what becomes of them.
As a child, Susanna is an amazing person, a golden-haired girl who wants
nothing more than to simply enjoy the world around her.
But the harsh and
imposing conditions of her parents' strict regime soon mean that she is
compelled to give up her carefree outlook. As her belief in love and the
innate goodness of people is torn from her, so she utilizes her considerable
intelligence to put distance between herself and her past.
Susanna learns that, by distancing herself from
others and maintaining borders, she can protect herself from experiencing
more pain. But because the experiences that caused her to adopt this
defensive strategy remain repressed, she has no means to understand what it
is that is truly motivating her behavior.
Susanna becomes a cynical but
powerfully motivated individual. Her driving ambition takes her to the top
of the corporate ladder, where the social and economic power she wields
enacts a terrible retribution upon the planet.
She does not recognize the damage she is doing
by forwarding the causes of corporatization for her motivations are entirely
subconscious, and her conscious mind always creates excuses. Because she
cannot recognize the pain and fear lurking within, she cannot stop acting
out her role.
And should one day she finally begin to understand her part in
the tragedy unfolding on Earth and leave the corporate environment, she
shall simply be replaced by one of the many under her only too eager to
forward their own subconscious agenda.
Barry, too, is a quite beautiful and amazing child. Then one day when he is
crawling about the floor, his mother shouts at him for getting under her
feet. His mother has been getting uptight recently for she has discovered
his father has been having an affair. Instead of discussing this with her
husband, she finds it easier to just take it out on Barry.
Pretty soon, Barry begins to accept that there
is no point in "someone like him" reaching out for love, for his experience
is that it is usually withheld and only results in him getting more pain.
And so, as he grows up, he becomes increasingly motivated to do things that
can give him some sense of the self-worth he subconsciously craves, none of
which of course work.
Barry gets a job as a clerk in a post office,
intending to use it merely as a stepping stone to a more rewarding life.
But his constant subconscious need to experience
self worth causes him to slowly be drawn into becoming little more than a
slave to consumer society. He works his life away simply to constantly
purchase goods, always wanting a new car or new toys for his children, and
spends much of his time dreaming of material wealth, believing that, if he
had it, the sense of dissatisfaction that lurks within him would go away.
Don is another quite beautiful child. He loves nothing more than to look
around him at the world going by and stare in wonder at the great beauty of
it all. At the age of three, however, Don's father decides it's time he
started to grow up, for it was at that age that his own father began to
enact his conditioning regime on him.
Don starts to find his every waking thought
being directed by his father, with any transgression being met with a firm
slap. Now grown up, Daniel still loves the natural world. He has no time for
consumer culture, soon leaves the small town he grew up in, and heads for
the city.
There he takes up with a local group of political activists and
begins attending demonstrations protesting the activities of the World Trade
Organization and similar bodies.
But soon Don's natural desire to reverse the
damage being done to our world becomes confused with his emotional need to
confront the repressive regimes of his childhood.
He finds himself
constantly drawn into violent confrontations with the police. And so his
efforts to change the world ultimately serve only to further marginalize
rebellion because his constant subconscious need to indulge in violent
confrontations with authority figures ensures that Barry and the millions
like him will never join Don on the front-line.
Slowly finding himself more and more driven to
hang out only with hard-core elements, Don's life begins to implode with
self-hatred as he starts to grapple with his inability to control his need
for violent confrontation.
He soon finds himself addicted to the illicit
painkillers which can at least help him maintain emotional stability and,
aged 29, is tragically found dead one morning of a heroin overdose in an
abandoned building. At his funeral his father believes that, if only he had
been tougher on his son, it would all have been different.
Not one of these three characters, or the millions they represent, have done
anything wrong.
All that has happened is that they have subconsciously
utilized natural avoidance strategies to deal with unnatural treatment.
Unconditioned, and living in a different time and place, they would all have
led quite different lives.
But here and now, in this time and place, they
have become merely the means by which the planet is becoming subject to
total control by those who understand how to manipulate human nature.
Part Four - Escape
Those of you who have read this far could now easily be finding yourselves
in a state of either incredulity or despair, possibly a mixture of both.
Could it really be true that such an organized assault on our freedom has
been going on for so long? And, if it is, what on earth can we do about it?
Well, don't panic!
Whatever you feel the truth of the matter is, the key to understanding all
that is going on around us is to realize that, as a people, we are becoming
more aware, and that, as we do so, so more and more people are beginning to
develop the capacity to see deeper patterns of causation in the world around
us and in the events of our lives. Alternative theories of history are thus
a natural product of the expansion of processing ability that man is
currently undergoing.
Most of the rest of this chapter is written for those who, to some degree,
do believe.
But, even if you are a hardened skeptic, even if
you aren't remotely convinced it is happening here and now, you might want
to think about ways to prevent this as a possible future scenario.
Evolution of the Mind
Fifty years ago people simply felt little need to question what they were
told to do by those "above" them.
But because the human mind is still
evolving, now they are starting to do so. And this is why the movement
toward globalization and the acceptance of microchip implants is proceeding
at such a pace. We are the sleeping giant beginning to stir, and those at
the apex of our culture need to shut the prison door tight before we awaken.
It is incredible that such a small group of
people could wield such a level of control in our world, and all we need to
do is wake up and actively express our concerns and the world will be safe.
And, without the goal of total control of the
world to aim for, the mass of activities currently being undertaken to bring
it into being will lose impetus, and the technological advances we have made
can be put to use for the benefit of all.
Change
The real source of the problem is the way we are treating our young.
Because
we prefer to give them things to demonstrate our love for them, rather than
actually express this love directly, our children grow up addicted to
material possessions.
Because we teach them wrong from right by
withholding affection, they grow up needing rules and regulations, overly
concerned with control and personal power. Because they don't adequately
experience affection, they grow up craving fame and adoration. And this is
principally happening because we experienced the same conditioning when we
were children ourselves.
If we therefore look at both healing ourselves of the effects of our own
conditioning, and progressively reducing the degree to which we condition
our own children, there will be a massive knock-on benefit to our society.
Within many of us there are deep fears that are
constantly restricting our ability to express ourselves, and if we wish to
avoid transferring these fears onto the next generation, we need to learn
where they are coming from and how to stop them crippling our desire for
change.
Remember, the elite are just a few among the six billion people on
this planet...
The entire source of their power is their
ability to corrupt natural instincts and direct subconscious needs into
channels of expression that further the ends of total control. This is all
they have.
And once this principle is understood by more people, it will
cease to be effective. Our world will change spontaneously around us and we
will be free to love one another in the way we always intended.
There are several basic ways in which people who want to can begin to
change our world.
-
Firstly, start to learn about the power of unconditional love. Unconditional
love is a real source of healing and actually the most powerful force in
existence. When this force begins to become powerful within you, you will
find everything else in your life becoming aligned in its wake.
-
Secondly, challenge the various "cashless society" schemes now quietly being
introduced in several European cities. Even if you think the whole idea is
ridiculous, might it not be worth clinging to cash for a few extra years
just to make sure?
The "SmartCities" project scheduled to commence in 2002 in Southampton, UK,
and Gothenburg, Sweden, is a good example. If the citizens of these towns
refuse to accept this plan, then any scheme for world domination is in deep,
deep trouble. It might seem ludicrous to believe that such a small thing
could save our world, but, in truth, the elite are only too aware of just
how tight a time schedule they are on. Once there is resistance at a key
point, the whole thing is so severely disrupted it will simply collapse.
The immense power that elite groups wield relies
entirely on sufficient numbers of people not knowing what is really going on
behind the scenes. If the elite cannot get cashless society prototypes
going, they cannot get the chips in. And if they cannot get the chips in
quickly, then soon so many people will will wake up to what is really going
on, it will all be over. So, cling to cash a little.
In addition, we can protest any moves to introduce microchip implants onto
the market. In January 2001, US biotech leaders Applied Digital Solutions
actually changed the format of their controversial product, Digital Angel,
after being bombarded by protests.
Digital Angel, a microchip with GPS tracking and
human bio-monitoring, was to be offered to the public in implant format, but
protests from so-called "conspiracy theorists" and Christian groups caused
the company to withdraw it and instead offer the chip in wristband format.
Advertising features that associate technological advance with implant
technology, such as Orange's recent "in the palm of your hand" series, can
also be attacked.
It doesn't matter if the advertiser does not intend to
"soften the way" for chip implants - if they are using the imagery of
implant technology, then protest is valid.
-
Thirdly, undertake charitable acts. There are always people less fortunate
than ourselves and they require our help. The homeless and those addicted to
hard drugs in particular are victims of the elite's inhuman strategy for
world domination.
-
And, finally, start trying to deal with pain that is repressed within. It is
this which causes us to alter our behavior and thinking to suit the elite's
purpose. In fact, the elite believe that all their power
is ultimately derived from the repression of emotions.
Release
The incredible tragedy unfolding in our world is ultimately just the result
of millions of personal tragedies that have occurred in our collective
childhood.
While we can never reverse what has happened, therapy can help us
access our original pain and stop it from controlling our thinking and
behavior. In addition, therapy can help us to stop suppressing feelings and
actions we believe are unacceptable in our belief that we need to create a
persona.
As Jung showed, every emotion we suppress in the
belief that we must present only a fragment of our total being to the world
continues to exist in our subconscious as part of the "shadow" - the
counterpart to the persona. And here all these repressed natural emotions
keep us locked in a world of fear and loathing.
Remember, there is nothing that we can do that
is unnatural, all emotions can be safely accessed and expressed, in
appropriate therapy, leaving us free from unnatural needs.
The gentle exploration of the subconscious mind, in such a manner that we
can slowly process its contents and express the pain held within, leads to
immense natural healing at a very deep level, not just for ourselves but for
the planet we inhabit.
These days there are a multiplicity of techniques
that can be employed to allow us to explore our subconscious mind, to
overcome fear, release trapped pain, and come to terms with childhood
memories.
These include:
-
psycho-synthesis
-
gestalt therapy
-
rebirthing
-
primal
therapy
-
psychodrama
-
reiki
-
transactional analysis
-
pulsing...
...to name
but a few.
A stress-filled life spent adopting avoidance strategies can be avoided if
one takes steps to progressively uncover any memories repressed within us
and express the associated emotions. This can be done via therapy or by
seeking out peak experiences.
All ancient cultures utilized means of
releasing the individual from the effects of repression.
Some would do this by entering into altered
states of consciousness achieved through ritual, the non-ordinary state
permitting emotional release to occur on a level not possible in normal
awareness.
Other cultures would have regular festivals where participants
would act out character roles, sometimes with the aid of masks or costume,
allowing people to escape sufficiently from their repressed self to release
the emotions trapped within.
In Greek mythology, the god Dionysus tells Man
that he must regularly engage in similar activities or else madness and
destruction will descend.
It was to the releasing of the effects of trauma
and conditioning that he was referring.
Evolution of Humankind
Increasing numbers of people believe that humanity is on the edge of a major
evolutionary leap.
And there is mounting evidence that many children born
now are more developed than those before them. This may be the reason for
the near epidemic in cases of hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder
now being diagnosed in the West.
Those familiar with chaos theory and how living systems evolve will be aware
that evolution does not proceed in a smooth and linear fashion. What
typically happens is that a few members of a species evolve, followed by a
major rearguard action thrown up by nature.
Eventually the pressure builds up to such a
level that nothing can stop the inevitable and the whole species rapidly
rises to a new level of coherence and order. In the ancient writings of the
East whence the elite derive their esoteric knowledge, it is believed that
the ego, the sense of self, is ultimately just a defensive response we
develop to block the experience of primordial fear.
And thus it may be that the centuries of the
elite's culture, the culture of the ego, is merely a natural rearguard
action waiting to be swept away.
Reach up and the future is ours.
