Of all the talk about
S.510, virtually no one has actually read the language in the
bill - especially not those lawmakers who voted for it.
The more you read from
this bill, the more surreal it all becomes.
For example, did you know there's a global FDA power grab agenda hidden in
the Food Safety Modernization Act? Keep reading and I'll quote text straight
out of the bill itself.
Section 305 is entitled "BUILDING CAPACITY OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WITH
RESPECT TO FOOD SAFETY" and it gives the FDA authority to set up offices in
foreign countries and then dictate the food safety plans of foreign
governments.
It says, specifically, on page 217 of
the bill:
SEC. 308. FOREIGN OFFICES OF THE FOOD AND
DRUG ADMINISTRATION.
(a) IN GENERAL. - The Secretary shall
establish offices of the Food and Drug Administration in foreign
countries selected by the Secretary.
It then goes on to say:
-
The Secretary shall, not later than 2
years of the date of enactment of this Act, develop a comprehensive
plan to expand the technical, scientific, and regulatory food safety
capacity of foreign governments, and their respective food
industries, from which foods are exported to the United States.
Huh? The FDA is now going to run the food safety
programs of foreign governments?
Look out, world: I'm from the FDA and I'm
here to help!
Homeland Security and U.S.
Treasury also involved
So who is involved in creating this? Believe it
or not, the global "food safety" plan is to be developed under consultation
to the Department of Homeland Security as well as the U.S. Treasury.
As the bill states:
-
Consultation - In developing the plan
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary
of Agriculture, Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Trade
Representative, and the Secretary of Commerce, representatives of
the food industry, appropriate foreign government officials,
nongovernmental organizations that represent the interests of
consumers, and other stakeholders.
You might reasonably wonder,
Learn more about the
Federal Reserve and you'll have the answers to these questions.
I don't have space for all the details here, but
read Ed Griffin's book (The
Creature From Jekyll Island) if you really want to know what's
behind a lot of this.
Codex harmonization, data
sharing and more
So what does this global food safety plan
actually entail? It's all spelled out right in the language of the law. You
can view this yourself on page 195 of the bill text in
the PDF file.
-
Plan - The plan developed under
subsection (a) shall include, as appropriate, the following:
-
"Provisions for secure electronic
data sharing."
This is so that the FDA can electronically track and monitor the
food production activities of foreign nations. That way, if
somebody in Spain tries to sell raw almonds to the USA, the FDA
can make sure those almonds get irradiated or fumigated with
chemicals first. Because raw
almonds are so 'dangerous'
they have actually been outlawed in America
-
"Training of foreign governments and
food producers on United States requirements for safe food."
This is designed to shove the
FDA's "dead food" agenda down
the throats of other nations. The FDA, you see, believes that
the only safe food is dead food - that's why, along with the
USDA, they have declared war on raw milk, raw almonds and many
raw vegetables.
Now, with this law, the FDA will begin pushing
its dead foods agenda globally, essentially
exporting the FDA's agenda of death and disease
by making sure other nations destroy the nutritive qualities of their food
supply in the same way the U.S. is doing.
It's all great for the global
Big Pharma profiteers, of course.
The more disease they can spread around the
world, the more money they'll make from selling medications.
Codex Alimentarius is
also promoted in the bill
The "Plan" described in this bill continues with the following:
-
"Recommendations on whether and how
to harmonize requirements under the
Codex Alimentarius."
This is included so that the FDA will "harmonize" the U.S. food
and dietary supplement industries with global Codex requirements
which outlaw virtually all healthy doses of vitamins and
minerals. Under full Codex "harmonization," America will be left
with a dead food supply and the health food stores will be
virtually stripped bare of dietary supplements. Selling vitamin
D at a reasonable dose such as 4,000 IU per capsule will be
criminalized and products will be seized and destroyed by FDA
agents who recruit local law enforcement to bring in the
firepower.
All this will, of course, ensure a diseased,
nutritionally-deficient U.S. population.
This actually seems to be the goal the FDA has
been trying to achieve all along because the more diseased the population,
the more money gets collected by
Big Pharma for
"treating" sick people with medication and chemotherapy.
It's all right in the
bill!
The text mentioned in this article is taken straight from the bill itself.
You can search for it at
http://thomas.loc.gov by searching for
"S.510" as the bill number.
It makes me wonder why some food book authors so wholeheartedly supported
this bill.
-
Why were so many progressives on the
left so enamored with this law?
-
Didn't they realize this was a huge FDA
power expansion that would destroy many small farms and put farmers
out of business while subjecting the USA to possible Codex
harmonization?
-
Did they even know the FDA is now on a
global food-killing agenda that will seek to pasteurize, fumigate,
cook or kill virtually every piece of food that enters the United
States?
-
Did they not know that the bill does
absolutely nothing to limit the
use of chemical pesticides on
imported food?
According to the FDA's stance on all this, foods
laced with
DDT and other pesticides are perfectly
"safe" for human consumption, but foods teeming with probiotics - such as
raw milk - are deadly and dangerous! (Seriously...)
-
How is it that popular food book authors
and food documentary producers could possibly support this bill?
-
Do they also think small dairy farmers
who sell raw milk should be criminalized?
-
Do they agree with the Codex
harmonization agenda?
-
Do they think the FDA should run the
world's food safety systems and that the Department of Homeland
Security and the U.S. Treasury should be shaping our global food
safety agenda?
You really just have to shake your head and
wonder about the true intentions of some people.
I just have to ask:
-
Were the supporters of this bill really
so naive that they could somehow believe the FDA would actually seek
to protect small, local organic farms?
-
What about raw milk producers?
-
What about the single-family farms that
must now apply to the FDA for exemption status by authoring research
reports, collecting tax returns and producing a pile of
documentation the FDA will soon require?
Let me just say it bluntly:
The Food Safety Modernization Act is the
destroyer of local organic farming. It will gut small farms and local
farms, greatly increasing the price of local organic food while
decreasing America's food security.
Farmers' Markets will be targeted by FDA
agents who raid the operations of local farmers and imprison them for
not having the right paperwork.
Families will be destroyed, and those who
have been successful at local food production will scale back their
operations in a desperate effort to duck under the $500,000/year rule
(which can easily be surpassed by producing just ten acres of organic
carrots, by the way).
The real agenda behind the
bill
From another point of view, however, this bill is doing exactly what it was
supposed to do:
Destroy small farms, wipe out family farm
operations, imprison raw milk producers and centralize food production
in the hands of the big corporate food producers whose operations are
steeped in pesticides and soil degradation.
This bill should have been called the "Big
Agriculture Monopoly Act" because that's what it does.
It will ensure that America's food supply will
be controlled by
Monsanto,
DuPont and other agricultural giants who have been at odds with
small organic farms for years.
The global food
control agenda is a conspiracy, not a theory
It's all part of the global food control agenda that we now know to be 100%
true based on the leaked
WikiLeaks cables which revealed that the
U.S. government conspired to push GMOs into Europe and "create a retaliatory
target list" for any nation that resisted GMOs (such as France).
Read that
full report here.
Thanks to WikiLeaks, we now know that the
global GMO conspiracy is quite real. It's
something that U.S. diplomats and government officials scheme on in order to
appease their corporate masters in the agriculture industry.
Now, with the Food Safety Modernization Act,
this global conspiracy extends beyond GMOs and encompasses the global food
supply, too.
It has become clear that U.S. lawmakers and bureaucrats will not stop until
they have killed the entire global food supply, rendering living foods, raw
foods and dietary supplements illegal or impossibly difficult to grow. You
can thank your U.S. Congress-people and Senators for all this, of course. In
the end, every Senator in office today caved in and voted to pass this bill.
You can also thank those who publicly promoted
this bill even while having no real idea of the horrors they were
supporting.
Such begins a new era of global food destruction headed by what can only be
called the most dangerous government agency in North America: The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. If they do to your food what they've done to
prescription drugs, annual food deaths will increase to over 100,000 a year.
Watch for the FDA to now set up enforcement offices in nations all around
the world and start outlawing living foods on a global scale (if they can
get away with it).
Also, watch for a new push for Codex harmonization which is a truly
evil agenda to criminalize healing foods and nutritional supplements that
prevent and even reverse chronic disease.
