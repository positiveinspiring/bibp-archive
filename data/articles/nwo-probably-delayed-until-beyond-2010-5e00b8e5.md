NWO Probably delayed
beyond
the year 2010
(Revelations of Awareness 94-3 General Reading, November 3, 1993)
This Awareness indicates there is
an old phrase that many young people today perhaps have not heard, but this
phrase is apropos for what appears to be coming in the struggle for the New
World Order, and this Awareness wishes to us it in this opening message. This
Awareness indicates It will first define the phrase: "Nip and
tuck." This Awareness indicates in earlier days in this century, entities
would say, for example: "It was nip and tuck all the way!", which
in a sense meant, give and take, or which meant the struggle was fairly evenly
matched for some time. "Nip and tuck" indicated that it was not
clear winning at that time, nor a clear closing, but that there was both winning
and losing back and forth as the struggle ensued between two opposing forces.
This Awareness indicates that It
sees the energies relating to that which is termed the NWO as that which is
moving in a kind of nip and tuck state where there will be that give and take,
that balance that is neither extreme nor of any surrender on either side,
but a kind of back and forth trade-off that keeps active for years to come.
Because of this nip and tuck positioning of forces it appears the NWO will
be delayed considerably... at least beyond 2010 before any serious differences
are experienced to lead to a conclusion. This Awareness indicates that it
does not appear that it will have a clear-cut conclusion to this struggle
until at least the year 2010.
By that time, the energies may be
much different, so that perhaps it does not even come about then. This Awareness
indicates It wishes to give this information now, because some of the
information given by this Awareness in the past describing the NWO may have
given the impression that it was fixed as a position on the horizon that would
indeed manifest on this plane.
This Awareness indicates there is
a plan for this to occur, but there is a big difference between the plans
of man and the outcome of the plan in reality, and it does not appear that
this will come about easily, if it does come about at all. This Awareness
indicates that even the proponents of the Book of Revelation may find
that the Book of Revelation does not meet with reality and that
the
Mark of the Beast may not ever completely manifest on this plane.
The "Book
of Revelation" a Masonic Writing
This Book of Revelation was
indeed a Masonic writings, that was inserted into the compilation of the Bible
because entities did not quite understand what it was talking about and were
fearful that they would leave out something of importance. This Awareness
indicates that if modern-day Biblical scholars had known and had the opportunity
to put the Book of Revelation in or leave out of the Bible, the realization
that it was of a Masonic nature would have led them to leave it out.
This Awareness indicates that in
those days, the Biblical scholars were not sure just what it was all about,
and they could use the symbolism to fit with certain of their own suspicions
about forces at the time and see it as a warning against those forces, and
therefore felt it could benefit their own purposes to include it.
This Awareness indicates they also
were concerned about the curses at the end which warned against changing any
wording of the book, and felt that if they did not include it, the curses
might also apply to them. Thus, it was included in the New Testament and has
been a mystery since. This Awareness indicates that even in the centuries
that followed, every generation was generally influenced by the Book of
Revelation, thinking that it applies even to these present times, in its
symbolic way because symbolism can be used to apply to many different situations
and because of the potential application of the symbols, entities often are
certain that it relates to these particular time.
The times will
follow their own historic and karmic directions through cause and effect
This Awareness suggests however,
that the times will follow their own historic and karmic directions through
cause and effect and the energies that are in motion, regardless of what the
Book of Revelation says. In other words, your time is not directed
by the Book of Revelation, and if a parallel occurs, it is because
the Book of Revelation is symbolic enough to have an application to
whatever occurs.
This Awareness indicates that those
who understand the nature of symbolism in the Tarot, for example, can see
how the Tarot could apply to various events that are occurring in their lives
on a daily bases and these symbols that have various meanings can be used
in their symbolism to be representative of events that are happening to any
entity under any situation.
This Awareness indicates that It
wishes entities to realize that the future is not fixed; that the Book
of Revelation or any other predictive source of information does not fix
the future. This Awareness suggests that a nip and tuck scenario in regard
to the NWO, the forces promoting and the forces objecting to it, does seem
to be in the future years, and this nip and tuck scenario will prevent it
from having a clear resolution within this (1900) century. This Awareness
suggests that therefore, through the remainder of this century (from 1993
on) you will probably be given more information about the threat and about
the curtailment of the NWO in its appearance or manifestation on earth.
