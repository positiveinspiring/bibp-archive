# Hillary IS the Candidate of the War Machine

There's no doubt that
Hillary is the candidate of Wall Street.
Even more dangerous, though,
is that she is the candidate of
the military-industrial complex.
The idea that she is bad on the corporate issues but
good on national security has it wrong.
Her so-called foreign policy
"experience" has been to support every war demanded by
the US deep security state run by the military and
the CIA.
Hillary and Bill Clinton's
close relations with Wall Street helped to stoke two
financial bubbles (1999-2000 and 2005-2008) and the Great
Recession that followed Lehman's collapse.
In the 1990s
they pushed financial deregulation for their campaign
backers that in turn let loose the worst demons of
financial manipulation, toxic assets, financial fraud,
and eventually collapse.
In the process they won
elections and got mighty rich.
Yet Hillary's connections
with the military-industrial complex are also alarming.
It is often believed that the Republicans are the
neocons and the Democrats act as restraints on the
warmongering.
This is not correct.
Both parties are divided
between neocon hawks and cautious realists who don't
want the US in unending war. Hillary is a staunch neocon
whose record of favoring American war adventures
explains much of our current security danger.
Just as the last Clinton
presidency set the stage for financial collapse,
it also set the stage for unending war.
On October 31, 1998
President Clinton signed the
Iraq Liberation Act that made it official US policy
to support "regime change" in Iraq.
It should be the policy
of the United States to support efforts to remove
the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in
Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic
government to replace that regime.
Thus were laid the
foundations for the Iraq War in 2003.
Of course, by 2003, Hillary
was a Senator and a staunch supporter of the Iraq War,
which has cost the US trillions of dollars, thousands of
lives, and done more to create ISIS and Middle East
instability than any other single decision of modern
foreign policy.
In defending her vote,
Hillary parroted the phony propaganda of the CIA:
"In the four years since
the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that
Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical
and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery
capability, and his nuclear program.
He has also given aid,
comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al
Qaeda members... "
After the Iraq Liberation
Act came the 1999 Kosovo War, in which Bill Clinton
called in NATO to bomb Belgrade, in the heart of Europe,
and unleashing another decade of unrest in the Balkans.
Hillary, traveling in
Africa, called Bill:
"I urged him to
bomb," she told reporter Lucinda Frank.
Hillary's record as
Secretary of State is among the most militaristic, and
disastrous, of modern US history.
Some experience:
Hillary was a staunch
defender of the military-industrial-intelligence complex
at every turn, helping to spread the Iraq mayhem over a
swath of violence that now stretches from Mali to
Afghanistan. Two disasters loom largest: Libya and
Syria.
Hillary has been much
attacked for the deaths of US diplomats in Benghazi, but
her tireless promotion of the overthrow Muammar Qaddafi
by NATO bombing is the far graver disaster.
Hillary strongly promoted
NATO-led regime change in Libya, not only in violation
of international law but counter to the most basic good
judgment.
After the NATO bombing,
Libya descended into civil war while the paramilitaries
and unsecured arms stashes in Libya quickly spread west
across the African Sahel and east to Syria.
The Libyan
disaster has spawned war in Mali, fed weapons to Boko
Haram in Nigeria, and fueled ISIS in Syria and Iraq.
In the meantime,
Hillary found it hilarious to declare of Qaddafi:
"We came, we saw, he died."
Perhaps the crowning
disaster of this long list of disasters has been
Hillary's relentless promotion of CIA-led regime change
in Syria.
Once again Hillary bought
into the CIA propaganda that regime change to remove
Bashir al-Assad would be quick, costless, and surely
successful.
In August 2011,
Hillary led the US into disaster with her declaration
Assad must "get
out of the way," backed by
secret CIA operations.
Five years later, no place
on the planet is more ravaged by unending war, and no
place poses a greater threat to US security. More than
10 million Syrians are displaced, and the refugees are
drowning in the Mediterranean or undermining the
political stability of Greece, Turkey, and the European
Union.
Into the chaos created by
the secret CIA-Saudi operations to overthrow Assad, ISIS
has filled the vacuum, and has used Syria as the base
for worldwide terrorist attacks.
The list of her incompetence
and warmongering goes on.
Hillary's support at every
turn for NATO expansion, including even into Ukraine and
Georgia against all common sense, was a trip wire that
violated the post-Cold War settlement in Europe in 1991
and that led to Russia's violent counter-reactions in
both Georgia and Ukraine.
As Senator in 2008, Hilary
co-sponsored
2008-SR439, to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO.
As Secretary of State, she then presided over the
restart of the Cold War with Russia.
It is hard to know the roots
of this record of disaster.
-
Is it chronically bad
judgment?
-
Is it her preternatural faith in the lying
machine of the CIA?
-
Is it a repeated attempt to show
that as a Democrat she would be more hawkish than the
Republicans?
-
Is it to satisfy her hardline campaign
financiers?
Who knows? Maybe it's all of the above...
But whatever the reasons,
hers is a record of DISASTER...
Perhaps more than any other
person, Hillary can lay claim to having stoked the
violence that stretches from West Africa to Central Asia
and that threatens US security...
