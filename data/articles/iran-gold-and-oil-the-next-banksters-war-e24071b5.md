I was personally present
when the deputy economics minister of Iran was talking
to a foreign society in Berlin
And the gentleman said very openly to the shocked
audience OK.
You dont want to buy our goods. Well, the Chinese do.
Christoph R.
Horstel
Remember the real reason why
Moammar Gadhafi is
dead.
He dared to propose and started creating an
alternative currency to the world reserve U.S. Dollar.
The lesson learned in
Libya is now ready for teaching in Iran. Forget all the noise about going
nuclear, the true message is that
the banksters rule and nation states serve
their ultimate masters.
The hype and disinformation that surrounds the push
for war is best understood by examining the viewpoint of Iranian MP Kazem
Jalali.
The Tehran Times
quotes him in saying,
"The European Union must be aware that it
can never compel the Islamic Republic to succumb to their will and
undermine the Iranian nations determination to achieve glory and
independence, access modern technologies, and safeguard its rights,
through the intensification of the pressure."
"The European Union is seeking to politicize the atmosphere ahead of
nuclear talks with Iran and is aware that sanctions on Irans oil
exports cannot be implemented since the world is not limited to a number
of European countries"
Many political commentators warn that an embargo
is an act or war.
Chris Floyd
provides this observation of the
recent oil embargo against Iran.
"This week, the warlords of the West took
yet another step toward their long-desired war against Iran. (Open war,
that is; their covert war has been going on for decades - via
subversion, terrorism, and proxies like Saddam Hussein.) On Monday, the
European Union obediently followed the dictates of its Washington
masters by agreeing to impose an embargo on Iranian oil.
The embargo bans all new oil contracts with Iran, and cuts off all
existing deals after July.
The embargo is accompanied by a freeze on all
European assets of the Iranian central bank. In imposing these draconian
measures on a country which is not at war with any nation, which has not
invaded or attacked another nation in centuries, and which is developing
a nuclear energy program that is not only entirely legal under
international law but is also subject to the most stringent
international inspection regime ever seen, the EU is "targeting the
economic lifeline of the regime," as one of its diplomats put it, with
admirable candor."
The most important aspect of the Iranian
response lies in the way that changes oil settlement for delivery and the
futile effect of the US/Anglo/EU imperialist dictates have in the
marketplace.
Debkafile reports that India (and probably China) will pay for Iranian oil
in gold.
"India and China take about one million
barrels per day, or 40 percent of Iran's total exports of 2.5 million
bpd. Both are superpowers in terms of gold assets.
By trading in gold, New Delhi and Beijing enable Tehran to bypass the
upcoming freeze on its central bank's assets and the oil embargo which
the European Union's foreign ministers agreed to impose Monday, Jan. 23.
The EU currently buys around 20 percent of Iran's oil exports."
A more detailed analysis in
Tehran Pushes to
Ditch the US Dollar provided ample arguments that an embargo will fail.
"Iran may be isolated from the United States
and Western Europe, but Tehran still has some pretty staunch allies.
Iran and Venezuela are advancing $4 billion worth of joint projects,
including a bank. India has pledged to continue buying Iranian oil
because Tehran has been a great business partner for New Delhi, which
struggles to make its payments.
Greece opposed the EU sanctions because Iran
was one of very few suppliers that had been letting the bankrupt Greeks
buy oil on credit. South Korea and Japan are pleading for exemptions
from the coming embargoes because they rely on Iranian oil.
Economic ties between Russia and Iran are
getting stronger every year.
Then there's China. Iran's energy resources are a matter of national
security for China, as Iran already supplies no less than 15% of China's
oil and natural gas. That makes Iran more important to China than Saudi
Arabia is to the United States.
Don't expect China to heed the US and EU
sanctions much - China will find a way around the sanctions in order to
protect two-way trade between the nations, which currently stands at $30
billion and is expected to hit $50 billion in 2015.
In fact, China will probably gain from the
US and EU sanctions on Iran, as it will be able to buy oil and gas from
Iran at depressed prices."
So why is the EU so determined to apply
restrictions is answered in the video, "Why does the EU join in sanctions
against Iran?":
Now that is part of the reason but for the entire story, one needs to
confront the contentions in the You Tube "Israel pulling the strings for war
with Iran":
Where is gets so confusing for the casual observer is that any discussion
that deems to be critical of Israel is a taboo discussion in polite company.
Well, when it comes to addressing the impending prospects of a major
conflict in the Middle East, the linkage between the deciding influences in
American policy that coincide with a greater Israel objective, is silenced
in the
old-line press and media.
Therefore, the key element to explore is the
relationship of Zionist interests with the fundamental preservation of the
paper currency imperium of
Federal Reserve notes as the medium of payment
for oil.
Think about this equation in light of ultimate control. Oil is the fuel that
runs the engine of all economies. Money is the medium of exchange that pays
for the petroleum.
War is the universal method used to avoid the breakdown
of the money recycling system.
In
The Petro-Dollar and the EURO, the nature of
this formula is probed.
"War is always about achieving a political
end. Even holy wars seek to impose a secular control over the
vanquished. At the root of every political conflict, lies the MONEY
component. On the scale of greed or fear, international discords can
slide up or down.
Depending on the circumstances or demands,
governments rally domestic populations to accept their foreign
interventionist goals.
Claims of altruistic liberation are
fictitious, when the rhetoric is stripped away and the real substance is
exposed. Notwithstanding, variances of emphasis; the motive of money
underpins the movements of all military confrontations."
Who can deny that the interest of the Israeli
state advances under the Petro-Dollar system for oil payment?
The prospect of allowing an oil exporter to do
business paid in gold disrupts the balances that maintain an uneasy
political rapprochement. Even more threatening to the globalist monopoly is
a defiant regime like the Islamic Republic playing by different rules that
bypass central banking approval.
It seems that the NeoCon Christian Zionists will never be happy until they
institute a techno drone bombing campaign to shut off even more oil
resources.
With Iraqi and Libyan production in shambles, it is now time to
eliminate the Iranian resource. Spiking oil to $200 or more through another
foreign intervention just hikes the balance sheets of the oil traders and
banking interests.
There is no doubt that foreign aid to Israel
will rise at even a higher amount.
The bonus is that the gold hordes of Iran would become the spoils of war and
conveniently find their way into the storage vaults of the banksters. This
is a sweet game as long as there is a continuous supply of gung ho
mercenaries to push the button of terror from the skies.
Moreover, sending boots on the ground serve an
even more profitable hellhole, the War Party can demand a much higher
budget, floated with even more debt bought by China with the proceeds from
the oil supply that are secured from the export of Canadian shale oil.
Miraculously, this pattern builds an even larger, if not, greater empire. As
long as new villains are found to master, the Irans of the world will
become subjugated under the background music of God Bless America.
What fools our fellow citizens became somewhere in the last century.
Remember the
John D. Rockefeller quote:
"Competition is a sin", especially
if IRAN is the player.
Body bags are made from petroleum base material.
In the height of irony, the oil wars are fought
to secure the substance to form the burial cloth for disposable soldiers. If
America really wants to stand behind the troops, their genuine duty is to
prevent and oppose the next Middle East war.
Iran is not an existential threat to the United States.
Haaretz reports that
former Mossad chief Meir Dagan said in a television interview,
"If Israel attacks Iran, it will be dragged
into a regional war".
According to Dagan, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas
will respond with massive rocket attacks on Israel. In that scenario, Syria
may join in the fray, Dagan said on the television program "Uvda".
Dagan
added that such a war,
"would take a heavy toll in terms of loss of life and
would paralyze life in Israel."
An America First foreign policy cannot wage another banksters war.
I say the war has already begun.
Theres a lot of sabotage, there have been assassinations, strange
things blowing up, rebellion.
So there is enormous pressure being
put on the Iranian regime from many directions
