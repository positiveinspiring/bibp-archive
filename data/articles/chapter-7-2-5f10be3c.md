sound like this: Black knight moves two spaces and
one right. White knight moves two spaces and one left. White knight
challenges black knight. Black Queen moves 5 spaces. The victim who
receives this programming must be the type of thinker who would play
chess reasonably well. The script can be shown via videos while the
victim is under hypnotic drugs.
F. Double Helix.
This is a very important system. The double helix
pattern is used as an elevator shaft running up and down the worlds
created for the alters. In general, each world lays at a trance level.
The double-helix is put in at programming sites where they have full
medical facilities, such as Letterman Hospital, Presideo, CA. The codes
up and down the elevator are alpha-numeric with lots of numbers. Because
the way the double helix shape twists, one can ride the elevator and get
off a level 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 but you have to ride it the other way to get
off at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Because the double helix is the centerpiece
of how the different physiological states of the mind are being layered,
taking the victim down to these different physiological states and
levels is very risky and by the time it is through it involves lots of
blood transfusions for the victim. The Caduceus is a double helix with
snakes at the top. The Caduceus is an occult symbol used in ancient
Babylon, ancient Hindu India, and by Chinese occultists. Mercury in
occult lore carries a staff called a caduceus. Mercurys staff is a
cabalistic symbol. William Hellers book on the Kaballah on page 78
states, Mercurys staff, called Caduceus, and made of intertwined
black-and-white twin serpents, heralds more forthcoming splits into
duality. Once again, it reflects the ambivalent mind, its conscious, and
subconscious states, its waking thoughts and imaginative dreams. So
according to cabalistic doctrine, the caduceus represents the various
states of the mind.
G. Flower system.
This system is attached to other systems, and
utilizes the power of peer pressure and generational ties. The flowers
will often be bright. The bud of the flower will represent one person,
the stem and the flower represent others. This system might be connected
to the Umbrella, the Trees, the Triangle and the Star. A flower can
regenerate an internal tree because of its generational roots. Flowers
are also used as elevator shafts, such as a sunflower. One has to jump
into the center of the flower and go down the stem to reach a lower
level. Flower fields such as the poppy field are used as a hypnotic
trigger to put an alter into deep trance.
H. Helix.
This is a simplified version of the double helix.
I. Hour glass.
Three hour glassed will be placed around the x-y-z
axis in a quadrant. A quadrant consists of a section of alters in a
world and their mirror images. The hour glass programming also includes
a suicide program. 12 disciple alters will be placed within the
hourglass. Each disciple has to memorize a disciple lesson. If something
triggers them, they will begin to fall through the hour glass. If each
of these 12 disciples falls through the hour glass like sand, then a
sleeping giant like in Jack in the Beanstalk will wake up, . When the
Giant awakes, he will kill the body. And of course, a mirror image of
the Giant alter will be made also to help insure that at least one of
the giants get the job done.
J. Mensa.
This is a program put into slaves who have
photographic memories. It involves lots of numbers and math. Its
overall structure looks like a triangular-shaped fish net, with all the
nodes or knots of the net containing a triangle. The core is place at
the center of the triangle and is surrounded by more triangles. There
are circles of alters within circles of alters. Circles within circles.
The a circle can rotate and seems never to end. The programming is meant
to be non-ending. There are also triangles within triangles. The effect
of using a structure like this to house the alters is that they feel
trapped in endless circles and mazes of triangles within triangles. The
codes in a Mensa system will be equations (sometimes called union force
codes), bar codes, and number sequences.
K. Pentagram system.
One pentagram system has pentagrams within
pentagrams. The geometric lines grow from pentagram to pentagram by
lines running in opposite directions. This has the same effect as
circles within circles.
L. Pool of Death.
One or more of these can be placed into an alter
system. They often are found inside the main castle. Dead alters and
body parts and torture fragments, are all dumped into these system
garbage dumps. The Spirits of Death and Destruction control these pools
of Death. Variations of this may be called Lakes of Death, and Waters of
Death. In some systems, this is overseen by Taskmaster alters.
M. Potters Wheel.
This is the equivalent to a computer utility program.
The way it functions is that the Programmer pulls the alters he wants to
work on up on the potters wheel in order to work on them. When they are
pulled up on the potters wheel, they can be asked to stand in order and
rank. Then the alters will come to the front of the mind on top of each
other in their prearranged sequence. The Charismatic movement
programmers like to use this, because the Programmer can become god,
and the slave becomes the clay. Can the pot talk back to the potter? The
Bible verse in ISA 45:9 is used, WOE unto him that striveth with his
Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall
the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What maketh thou? or thy work,
He hath no hands? The next verse again repeats its woes upon those who
question parents who fashion a child.
As is typical of a number of
Illuminati programs, at first glance they look like they are merely
perversions of the Bible, but a closer look reveals that they are
actually ancient occult rituals. For instance, the Illuminati believe
As above, so below. This is druidic philosophy, even though it sounds
somewhat like something from the Bible. In the book Invocation of the
Gods Ancient Egyptian Magic for Today, pg. 203, the book gives a magical
invocation that supposedly has been found in ancient Egyptian magical
papyri. At any rate this invocations wording is powerful in English for
a Monarch slave. The Invocation is called The Potters Wheel.
Hear the sound of the potters wheel
As it spins! Khnum!
See the clay on the potters wheel
As it spins! Khnum!
Feel the hand of the Mighty Lord Form the seed to
contain a soul
As it spins.
See the soul, on the Wheel of Life
As it spins! Khnum!
Birth to death on the Wheel of Life See the soul, on
the Wheel of Life
As it spins!
And with death we are born anew
While the vessel thats tossed aside Will return to
the potters wheel
As it spins!
This is just one more example of where programming
and magic intersect.
N. Puppet System.
In this system the body feels totally disjointed and
controlled by strings. Mengele enjoyed this program. He would say,
Dance Marionette dance. In other words, to paraphrase, dance slave
for me the controller. Demons are laid in to pull the strings of the
puppet. The internal controller may be a demon or a demonized alter. It
can be attached to other systems such as the Pentegram system. In a
previous part of the book, it was discussed how the victims body is
paralyzed by drugs and then electroshocked in a way that the person
seems to be the Programmers puppet. This is put in when the child is
very young. This puppet programming is very convincing to a small child,
and is a very nasty program for the slave to experience.
O. Solemetric system.
This is used for government/business/research slaves
who must perform complex tasks and they want their minds to be less
fragmented or not fragmented. The mind can be programmed and divided
from itself without creating alter personalities. Because the divisions
in the mind due to dissociation and programming lies are not as deeply
structured, victims who get solemetric systems have strong demonic
forces and lots ritual to hold their systems in place.
P. Spider Web system or Black Widow Spider System.
This system is set up just for blackmail and
destruction via entrapment of unsuspecting people who are perceived as
threats to the Illuminati. This system is found in lots of women coming
into churches with decent by naive ministers. The system has a web with
connectors and silk strands. A target person will be symbolically placed
into the web and then the black widow alter(s) will entrap the victim.
This is programming to take down pastors of churches with sexual
entrapment. The spirit Viper found in ISA 59:5 is placed into this
system to protect it. There will be egg alters which will devour the
victim, and Gatekeepers are assigned to guard the system.
Q. Spiritual structuring.
The spiritual structuring is not a single structure.
A few people have worked with the deeper elements of the programming to
help victims and also know what the Illuminati programmers have done and
what their agenda is, have come to realize that the spiritual
structuring is the most important part of an Illuminati system. What you
will now read is known only to an exclusive few. Spiritual castles
(Grandfather, Father, Mother, and Grandmother castles) and spiritual
temples (to Moloch and Baal etc.) are constructed internally.
Entire
spiritual worlds are constructed internally. The most primal parts of
the mind, and the key early alters and the core essence are usually
taken to spiritual constructs within the Illuminati slave. The gems are
empowered by the light of Lucifer (an alter-demon combination). But even
more deeper than that are the generational ties. The programmers, who
themselves are generational satanists, are part of a plan where the
generational legal rights of Satan are accumulated upon an individual.
In the Scriptures it says that the sins of the fathers are visited upon
the third and fourth generation. This gives Satan a legal right to the
generational victim. Each bloodline has its Prince demons attached to
it--just like in the Bible the Prince of Persia was both a man & and a
demon. Hidden within spiritual constructs such as black diamonds, and
diamonds, are further demonic constructs.
The thrones of the
generational Prince Demons are attached to the primal human part of the
victim. This is entirely spiritual--beyond that there are no words to
describe it. It is very real to the survivor when therapists get to that
point (which is very rare!). The power of the Illuminati is that it is
generational. They build upon that, when they build a system. Some of
these genealogies have not been free for many generations. If you want
to spoil a structure, one need to bind the strongman. The strongman in
an Illuminati system is the generational ties.
All ties to the
bloodlines need to be renounced. The Programmers will take little
Illuminati children to crypts of their ancestors in order to better
attach the generational spirits. The womb holding the premature child is
used as a temple in the Moon Child ceremonies. After the child is born
the womb structure will spiritually serve as a temple for the primal
human parts of an Illuminati slave. Whether the therapist can realize
these things or not, in the very least, they are aware of the saying
Father like son, and are aware how traits may skip a generation but
how a grandson may mirror a grandfather. The generational aspects to
Illuminati slaves are a major role in the Illuminati
R. Stairwell.
The stairwell is just as it sounds, it is a stairwell
that is placed into a system. The stairwell can be used as a trap for
alters who are unwise enough to be lured by programming to go into it.
The stairwell system connects various levels. There are booby traps and
demonic entities attached to the system. Stairwells may be sealed up
with Gatekeepers assigned to protect them. If an alter proceeds down a
stairwell to get to other levels they need to realize that they
initially will hit tornado (also called whirlwind) programming and
flooding of memories. The tornados will spin the victim inward and
disorient them. The alter holding the body will feel as if it is out of
control and going to die.
S. Telescoping.
Any telescoping object (such as a telescoping army
drinking cup, or a telescoping rod) can be used to give the visual
picture for the child to follow when it is being programmed. A
telescoping system often has a time level, a function level and an age
level. The game of Chutes and Ladders along with Jacobs Ladder have
been used to place the story line into children.
T. Tornado System.
This is a free floating system that moves around
areas that the programmers want protected. When it hits an alter(s) it
causes confusion, spinning, and switching, as well as a feeling of
losing control. Its part of the elemental back up programs discussed
within a few pages.
U. Umbrella.
This is associated with military programming. An
umbrella protects something, such as the Delta assassination alters. An
umbrella must be taken down from the inside and so must this protective
shield of the Umbrella program. One Umbrella system had 7 gates to it.
DEFENSES IN DEPTH
What would happen if a slave physically got away from
its master or handler? This has happened countless times and the
mind-control is so solid that the handlers dont have too much to worry
about. Mind-controlled slaves have gone to therapists for years and
never gotten free of the mind-control. The therapeutic process that the
establishment has schooled them in and then requires them to adhere to,
prevents the therapist from doing things that might really set the
victim free. Therapists are often loath to give any help in any thing
that smacks of spirituality. The spiritual issues in many of these
slaves are the most crucial issues facing them. If they dont resolve
these spiritual issues, the deeper alters will continue to adhere to
their blood oaths of allegiance to their Satanic abusers and their oaths
to serve Satan loyally.
Each cult which programs, makes sure that they place
in lots of loyal alters, which therapists call persecutor alters because
they torment the alters who want freedom. If therapists try to eliminate
these persecutor alters, they will fight back with the full tenacity and
strength that the survival instinct gives to anyone. Their persecutor
role needs to be validated, and then redirected toward productive ends.
Many persecutor alters see life simply as following their instructions
and that they are protecting the system from greater harm by stopping
therapy. During programming that was the case, but if their System has
reached a good therapist and has good support team of other people,
their fears no longer apply. The cult will attempt to show them that
their fears do still apply. Hopefully, the support team for the system
of alters will work as hard at protecting as the abusers do to reinforce
the fear. Many of the programmers have been associated with the
military.
One of the tricks that the military learned is a defense in
depth. The Russians employed defenses in depth with great success in
1943 in the big battle of Kursk during W.W. II. The first defense is
that the slave has no awareness of the MPD (DID) or that they are being
used as a slave. Some of the alters will realize that something is
wrong, but the mind control is too strong for them to see clearly.
Essentially the System is in trance all the time, even the front alters,
they do not perceive reality like people who are not in trance all the
time. The next line of defense is that the fronts of an alter System
dont have a clue about the abuse or what their system has been designed
for. The front alters will have alters which are loyal to the master,
and alters who are full of craziness and disinformation. If the victim
keeps probing (which many dont) they will discover an occult
involvement.
Even if they discover that the System is related to the
occult world, the programming is still intact. If the person finds out
he is MPD, and finds out that the System was part of the occult world,
then he still is captured by all the programming which is intact. Walls,
fire walls, mazes, suicide programming, internal armies, programmed
craziness and many other tactics sap the strength of the front alters if
they try to deviate from the straight and narrow programmed way of
behaving. WHEN THE FINAL CALL BACK IS GIVEN--many Monarch slaves are
programmed to kill their therapists because the Illuminati will be able
to hide/protect them once they leave their place in society and return
for the final callback. Reporting alters hidden well in the System,
observe and secretly report back to the Network everything a therapist
does. The alters have fix me codes to call for help such as FIX ME,
QUEEN OF HEART, THREE LITTLE KITTENS WHO LOST THEIR MITTENS, THE
COWS IN THE CORN, LITTLE JACKIE HORNER WONT YOU PLEASE BLOW YOUR HORN.
The jokers and internal programmers will work night and day to stop or
reverse any work done toward freedom. There are so many levels, suicide
programs and so many other defenses a persons body is not strong enough
to attack the programming head on. There are for instance Bells of
Destruction programming, The War in the Heavens suicide programming, the
Gethsemane Suicide Programming, the Octopus suicide programming, the
Injection of Bleach, the overdose of drugs, the go insane program, just
to mention a few. The slave will be given a whole batch of these types
of programs which may all go off at once if the slave doesnt comply
with keeping the mind control secret. One internal protective
programming line is The Man without a Country story. Another is a water
program but in with Scripture from Jer. about Ahab stomping the grapes.
Another is for the slave to think they have been turned into a fragile
paper doll. The paper doll programming is put in by making the skin very
sensitive to any touch, and then attaching that memory to the hypnotic
suggestion of being a paper doll. An octopus suicide program chokes the
slave if they are disobedient.
A mush the brain is triggered by a
fanning movement. If the slave touches the programming, Armageddon
programming is activated in those who have Bible programming. The four
horsemen on their different horses ride out and bring their different
mental tortures to the slaves mind. Winged monkeys (possibly alter
fragments) from the Wizard of Oz story programming are called
watchers. They watch alters. The slave is conditioned that if any
programming or demonology is taken out, it will come back seven times
seven stronger. The Bible (MT 12:43-44) is used to put in this
programming. Actually, this is more than programming, there is a
principle in operation here. Therapists need to be cautious about
pulling things out, if they do not understand what the ramifications
will be. We want the victim to have hope, not to make the task look
harder.
One of the primary protective programs is the JUDAS PROGRAMMING.
Anyone who betrays the abusers is labelled Judas and is programmed to
go out and act like Judas by hanging themselves. If that mind-control
program doesnt happen, the Illuminati warn their people Remember Tom
Collins, who was the son of an Illuminati Grand Mother, who became a
Christian, started exposing the Illuminati in churches, and was gunned
down in a grocery parking lot. Finally, the members are warned that they
will be sacrificed on a cross like Christ in what is termed a traitors
death. Usually, mind-controlled slaves will police their own actions
and thoughts. The therapist may hear their Monarch client talk about the
Dove, fire, Moriab, and water as protectors.
They may talk about a
little bird dove who is part of protection which flies into the ebony
trees. The basic defensive programming placed into the early Illuminati
models was based upon the 4 BASIC ELEMENTS--fire, wind, water, and air.
When the programming is touched by anyone, the elements of the earth
come alive. For instance, if the programming is touched the following
programs based on the four elements come alive:
WATER -- victim will freeze like ice, will suffocate
like inhaling water, will boil like being placed in boiling water, will
feel a drip drip drip on the head, and will flood with memories. This is
why some Monarch slaves do not like to swim.
FIRE -- Victim will burn inside and outside. The
victim will remember fire torture, and perhaps their face melting. This
is why some Monarch slaves dont like to light a match or a fire. Slaves
will have their programming reinforced with the warning, If you disobey
us, Satan will take your ability to resist burning away, and you will
burn in hell. The alters have no way to conceive that God could love
them, so they feel if they are to have any chance not to burn in the
afterlife of hell they must obey. The fire programs which activate when
they disobey reinforce this warning. Often victims report a Ring of
Fire burning within.
EARTH -- the victim will remember being dropped down
a well, being buried alive in either hot sand, or a casket. Earth means
life or death. The earth swallows people up. The victim may feel
dehydrated from memories of being buried in hot sand (hot earth). This
is why some victims have a fear of being buried alive. In fact, this can
be done internally where alters are internally placed in caskets and
buried. Alters are also internally thrown into internal wells. The
Illuminati programmers say, ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST to mean that
the earth will bring death. Sometimes even volcanoes erupt (earth and
fire) out of the ocean (water) and destroy parts of a system. Internal
earthquakes also happen quickly and then the entire system will be
shifted and shuffled.
AIR or WIND -- Vortexes suck the person down and
away, a strong wind takes the alter(s) into the Rubicon of Outer Space
and the body dismembers itself as it goes away. The mind doesnt
understand why it is being torn apart, only that it is being torn like a
tornado. The alter may also go into a bubble and float away. (This effect
is put in w/ drugs and hypnosis.) They will dissociate and nothing is
real. How does one place into a child these types of programs? Lets say
the programmers want to put in the Tumbleweed Program where the child
feels like it has become a tumbleweed & cant ground and get its
bearings on anything. Lets say the programmer also wants the child to
lose his arms & legs while being blown away.
The child is dehydrated so
the mind is overheated and hallucinating. Special drugs are also given
to the child to make it more delirious, make it more suggestible, etc.
The little child by this point has no mind of its own. Heavy fans with
hot air are placed upon the child. It is hypnotically told that it has
no arms and no legs. The child is too weak to think for itself. It is
almost comatose. The child will be left for perhaps 8 hours as a script
which keeps repeating itself is played on a voice box. The child will
hallucinate the script or the video it is being shown.
When the child
can give the script back to the programmer exactly like it is meant to
be, then the programmers know they can stop. The child alter is to take
on the identity of the tumbleweed. If it responds like many Main
alters--it will pass this ability on to splits that it creates for this
purpose. These splits created for the tumbleweed script will be clean
slates for the programmers to manipulate. By the way, smelling salts are
used to wake up child victims who are too comatose.
OVER VIEW ON THE PRINCESS PROGRAMMING.
The Omega programs prevent integrating the Multiple
personalities, and they hold the body programs, and run the computers.
If major tampering is done with the System, which threatens to totally
wipe out the Omega programs, then one of the backup programs is the Princess programming. The princess programming is a back up program. It
can be triggered several ways. One method is by astral communication
between loyal alters and their Illuminati programmer. However, the main
triggering factor is that the System has recognized that serious
tampering has been done to the System. If serious deprogramming occurs,
the Princess program with Sleeping Beauty kicks in.
The programming is
contained within a box, which is opened up upon the appropriate cues.
The way it operates is that it kicks in when the handler loses control
over a system. The princess who is kept sleeping by spiders which bite
her in a coffin, wakes up and looks for the prince to come. Daddy demon
and the dark princess are now ruling from the castle dungeon. A Systems
dwarfs and Thor continue to guard as well as the big guard cats like Beast. Darkness sets in on all the top sections of alters, and thick
walls and pain come, then a webbing much like a body-suit-cocoon will
envelope all but alters loyal to the master. It becomes hard to breathe
and the alters who had sought freedom from the programming, now find
themselves being tranced out.
Alters who are cold and in lots of pain
are called up by code to torment the body. The Outer Darkness of a
System (sometimes called the Rubicon) gets thicker. If Gatekeeper and
Kitten alters have porcelain face programming, then they will get their
porcelain masks back as the Omega programming kicks back in. The
porcelain masks have cords back to the black princess. The black
princesss coffin has cords to Papa. The core will give her energy to
the dark side, and alters who want freedom will receive very little
energy. They will be very tired. Those alters who liked the light side
and freedom are now under attack. They will be isolated by walls and
then incapacitated by a cocoon which leads to death. The alters who do
not want to be part of Satanism will be worked over, and they will
continue to be worked over until they shatter. If need be, they can be
taken to the castle dungeon and played movies of torture which have been
coded and entered into the mind via codes. Internal voodoo will be
carried out to scare alters into complying. The worlds will reestablish
their compasses.
The internal BEAST computer along with the dark
princess run the show. The box which opens up, sets off the suicide
programming. The primary tool in fighting the suicide programming is the
will to fight. If the will to fight is strong, a way to fight through
the walls can be found. If the walls are broken down, then a strategy of
isolating the castles programming can be carried out, and eventually
the black princess can even be retrieved. Since the princess and daddy
demon are running things via spiritual and demon processes, the battle
at this point involves spiritual warfare, although there are probably
other methods to solve the situation. The castle programming will be
isolated by closing the portals, and other safeguards. The Black
Princesses can be turned from their course.
The Black Princess can be
retrieved. The castles power can be shut down. The Princess programming
can be beat, but it takes hard work. A system must make decisions to
continue fighting the programming with all their creativity, strength
and will power. A rebirthing program will go off. This rebirthing
program is controlled by a System of clocks. The clocks are the
stabilizing heartbeat and are tied to the eternal life force. There are
also clocks which control the steps to the Princess Programming. These
clocks bring about steps which will take the System down the road to
no-return. These clocks can be frozen and by freezing them, one can stop
the next step from taking place. In the rebirthing program, umbilical
cords and strings run from alters back to the black princess.
The black
princess is in the torture chamber of the dungeon and the strings carry
the torture memories to alters in sections wanting freedom, especially
those holding the body. If those alters want to stop the intense pain to
the body they need to freeze those strings and stop the torture memories
from coming up from the torture chamber. The umbilical cords are
feeding the alters from the black princess. The Kittens alters, most
likely due to programming, will want to protect the core so they do not
want to stop the process of control that the black princess is exerting
over them. In other words, they will find it hard to save themselves.
Internal Voodoo will come from a dollhouse, and only by dealing with
inside the doll house can it be stopped. One option is to create shields
to protect alters from the voodoo.
Christians have the shield of faith
which really can function in real life, and an internal shield of faith
has protected and shielded Christians from Voodoo. The darkness and what
people (alters) call walls can be flooded with the blood of Jesus,
which often drives back the darkness and can give freedom to work. The
soul ties that are involved with the princess programming and the masks
need to be broken and bound. The System may be able to find someone or
some place to get wisdom or understanding about their System. The System
also needs to cut their soul ties to their Illuminati programmers.
The
rebirthing program is also giving directions to the dark princess. There
is an umbilical cord which ties the dark princess to the rebirthing
program. The blood of Jesus can stop this tie.
BACKUP PROGRAMMING
One of the backup programs is designed to deal with
someone who has a good understanding of a system, and tries to take a
system out via spiritual warfare. A camera is designed to reflect an
image onto a mirror and the deprogrammer works with the mirror images.
The deprogrammer has great success with the mirror images, because the
camera can merely shift its view, and the things the deprogrammer is
trying to get rid of disappear. However, since the alters that are
collaborating with the deprogrammer see all the correct things happen,
they sincerely think they are being deprogrammed. When the deprogrammer
finishes the alters feel better, see their worlds come together, but the
work has only been a sham. Other backup programs provide the
deprogrammer with mirror images and sham alters to talk with. The
deprogrammer never talks to the real human elements.
If we try to give a
summary of the different backup programs we could include
-
each grid has programs attached to its grid no. and each section has a
computer, as well as connecting computers between sections---both the
programming and the computers have the power to reprogram themselves.
-
the 4 elements of nature coming alive programs
-
the princess program (based on Sleeping Beauty)
-
a plutonium or atom bomb set up activated by lasers to protect the
internal hierarchy.
The Monarch programming creates very complex systems
that are as sophisticated as an Apollo spacecraft. There is no way all
the possible in and outs can be covered. However, the reader can watch a
movie Labyrinth to get a good idea of what the end product is like for
the mind of the victim. The movie represents what the internal world is
like for an alter who is trying to understand its mind. It would be
worthwhile to finish this chapter on structuring by covering this movie
which illustrates the end product. The bizarre movie Labyrinth may be
shown again on HBO and is available from some video stores. In fact, the
video stores have a hard time meeting customer demands for this popular
video. One of the co-authors knows a girl who has watched Labyrinth
twenty times.
LABYRINTH, A VIEW OF A MONARCHS INTERNAL WORLD
In 1986, a movie called Labyrinth was produced by
Cherry McFadden. The movie was Monty Pythons Terry Jones scripted.
The movie is a portrayal of what the internal world inside a Monarch
mind-controlled slave looks like. The Monarch slave has an internal
world built inside their mind in which the hundreds and thousands of
alters must live in. The alters are given a psychotic world of fiction
in which they must live in as reality. An alter of a Monarch slave will
have two worlds, the external world of reality, and their own internal
world which, because of the programming, will seem more real than the
real world. Hogel, a gnome, tells Sarah, Things are not what they seem
in this place. The internal worlds of the slave can be shifted and
rearranged by the internal programmers.
The internal programmers can
change codes, eliminate alters, and carry out extensive deception to
other parts of the System. As in the Monarch programming, the movie s
castle reminds one of Emerald City. The movie Labyrinth seems weird and occultic. Gargoyle elves (similar to coven demons) dance magic and a
sweet girl played by Jennifer Connelly moves from one weird scene to
another, while an occasional shot gives us the hideous ruler of the
Castle played by David Bowie. These demons also guard the baby that
represents the innocent core. Monarch slaves very frequently have
castles built into their internal world. Some slaves will have a whole
series of castles, some are Kings castles, some are Queens castles,
and some are castles shaped liked pyramids with all-seeing eyes in
them.
The story line of the movie Labyrinth is that the girl, Sarah,
searches for her baby brother, Toby, who is captive in a castle in a
dream world. Actually, this represents an alter searching for the
innocent core from which it split off from. Often the core (the original
innocent child personality which split off personalities in order to
remain innocent is locked up in the castle by the programmer who serves
as Master of the castle. Often in deprogramming, the core is taken to a
castle dungeon in a terrible backup program called the princess program
which was just described on a previous page. The princess programming
(which is a back up program) functions, when the regular programming
goes down (which is rare). When the Princess back-up program kicks in
the toad is kissed, the princess core is woke up, etc. etc. Parts of the
Princess program seem portrayed towards the end of the movie.
In the
movie, David Bowie, who in real life was a satanist & a rock star who
committed suicide, plays the part of the Master of the Castle. The girl
soon goes into the dream world (internal world of her mind). She must go
through a labyrinth if she wants to get to the castle. Although the
movie is fiction, it is close enough to how a Monarchs mind thinks,
that an adult Monarch slave might well have his or her programming
reinforced if they saw this film. It also would trigger many Monarch
slaves and create fear in them. Monarch slaves have many clocks built
into their systems. They have internal clock makers and internal clock
keepers. In the movie, clocks pop up everywhere just like in a Monarchs
mind. Some Monarch slaves are programmed to see their internal world,
and others are programmed not to be able to see their internal world. In
other words, many Monarchs may not have the ability to see a great deal
at first of this programming due to further programming, and yet these
images work in the deep recesses of their minds to keep their minds
within the confines of the programming.
David Bowie has the magical
ability to rearrange time on the clocks. The handlers often mess with
the internal and external clocks of a slave, so that the slave is
disoriented about what time it is. Alters within a Monarch system are
not allowed to stray from the path assigned to them. If they try to move
out of their assigned spot in the mind, then they encounter traps,
mazes, tunnels and demons just like in the movie Labyrinth. An internal
world of a Monarchs mind will have brick walls, doors and vortex
tunnels just like in the movie. When the girl falls into a vortex, she
has magician hands all over her. Monarch victims speak of what vortexes
are like and they often describe hands coming out of no where. The movie
begins with an oak tree. The oak tree is an important part of the
Illuminati programming.
The Master programmer in the castle, wearing a
triangle medallion around his neck and looking veracious (David Bowie)
sings, Voodoo. ..Babes with the power.. .magic spells...dance
magic...slap that baby and make him pay....dance magic, dance magic.
Cobwebs are built into the Monarch minds, and when an alter goes where
it shouldnt they often get cobwebbing over them. The tunnels in the
movie are full of cobwebs. As the girl moves forward toward the magic
demon-invested Castle she comes across many things--all of which relate
to internal items built into a Monarch slaves mind. Some of the things
are slightly different in the movie than in a slaves mind--but the
concepts are the same. For instance, the actual Thor figure looks like
the Iron Man of the Wizard of Oz series rather than the iron robot that
they portray. But the match is close enough for the imagery to portray
what it is meant to represent. During programming, bracelets with pieces
will be given to the child to teach them how the alters are to revolve.
A bracelet like this is owned by the girl.
The girl encounters a dwarf.
The dwarfs in the internal world mine the jewels (that is the
programming). The Jewels are the particular programs that run a Monarch
system of alters of an MPD (DID) mind. The dwarf in the movie is told by
David Bowie (the Programmer) that he has lost his Jewels--that is that
he has lost his programming! The dwarf in the movie decides to help the
girl. In Monarch programming the dwarf helps an alter by bringing it
programming! Some help! The goblin (demon) is asked by the girl to find
a portal. The goblin opens a door and it appears to be a broom closet.
He opens it again and it appears as a door. This is the exact way the
programming is.
Portals and doors in the internal world have cover
stories. At first they look like one thing--but if the mind can get by
the first look--they will turn out in reality to be something else.
There is cover programming over everything--so that the slave doesnt
trust his own mind. For instance, besides lots of clocks undisguised,
clocks are disguised in a System as any object, but they can be
recognized by the trained observer because they are gold colored. In the
movie, objects are constantly changing. Many monarchs fear the rocks
coming alive--just as they do in the movie labyrinth. In the bottom of
the slaves mind--put in at the deepest hypnotic levels possible are the
hell pits.
The movie shows the hell pit and even calls it the hell
pit. Notice that as she goes into this strange world that the clocks
can be turned around. This is true in the programming. The clocks can be
turned by the programmer so that the slave can be told it is January
when it is December. A cover program can be entered so that the slave
has memory of what he was supposed to have done in December. These false
memories are laid in with real torture memories and tied to emotions.
The false memories lack certain characteristics of real memories--and
yet still they can at times be difficult to separate from the true
memories, especially if the mind-controlled slave is in programming. The
following is the story line of the movie as it happens in this bizarre
movie. Early in the movie we see a witch with an hour glass. When the
girl gets to the castle it is guarded by a mechanical monster that
resembles in some ways Thor of the programming. Notice that portals and
holes open up.
When they open up another level, protectors attack them
and they must run back down their tunnel to save themselves. The Monarch
slave will get feelings of being crushed if an alter ventures where it
shouldnt in the mind. When the girl asks the dwarf How can I believe
anything you say? She is told, What choice do you have? Fire demons
come out dancing. They take out their eyeballs and eat them. They say
Bad luck down the path. What the fire demons represent are the Gamma
programming and the threats that the Gamma programming has upon the
victim. The programming tells an alter that it will lose its head or
other horrible threat if it doesnt comply with the programming. Lets
take off her head the fire demons say, as they act out the various
programs--decapitation, delimbing, etc.
They also want to throw her into
the pit of eternal flames. They go down a chute into the eternal hell
pit. It is even called the eternal pit in the movie! The hell pits of a
slave will generally smell like sulfur--which is exactly what the
movies hell pit does. A guardian of the pit (looking like a dog) comes
out. Guardians within the Monarchs mind are generally far more
horrifying than this dog. The guardian must give permission for passage.
Another trap appears--as the slaves internal world is filled with booby
traps. The name of the dog the guardian rides on is Ambrosius, similar
to Ambrosia. A peach with poison is given to the dwarf. The slave is
programmed to fear poisoned fruit. (This is another fairy tale turned
into programming.) David Bowie is called an adept who creates dream
bubbles. The slaves mind will have adepts who are the programmers. The
movie s adept puts a princess in a bubble.
Then she goes by memory back
to when she was at a Satanic ball where people wear masks of birds,
goats, and pigs. Illuminati ceremonies include balls like this with
masks. This Love story is reliving programming of the girl that she is a
Queen, that she is married to Satan, and that this is a bonding
ceremony. Everyone is grabbing her. People who have been to this
Illuminati ceremony will recognize it. Next, she sees mirrors. When she
shatters the mirrors (a no-no in the programming) she begins falling.
Generally, if a slave shatters the mirrors in their mind--they fall into
suicide programming. She falls into a junkyard. Then a satanic seed
comes alive from her fruit. It is a worm. An old hag gives her a teddy
bear. The programmers and parents of slaves frequently give stuffed
animals. The teddy bear without hands represents to the victim their
helplessness. The old hag says like a little bunny rabbit...Dont
you...Bitsy Boob All this is Monarch programming stuff. Then she sees a
book about the labyrinth.
The Monarchs mind has libraries and diagrams
of their own system but these are kept guarded by the mirrors, the
demons, and programming. The girl Sarah finds a book (the files) of how
the labyrinth is built. Actually, you can too. If the original
programming was Wizard of Oz programming--then when you looked at the
front of the Wizard of Oz series books you would find a map that helped
build the internal world. Some of the items on that map will likely be
found in your Monarch system (but not all). If your Monarch system has
Star Trek programming it is possible they will have an internal world
similar to the diagrams shown in this book where Star Trek programming
is covered. In other words, there are books which do show the labyrinth,
just as the movie Labyrinth has Sarah find a book showing the internal
world.
But if an alter finds a map, this does not mean the alter can
travel freely in its systems mind! In working with a mind-controlled
slave, we discovered one of the methods to get over the Wizard of Oz
mazes was to fly with the Orks. However, an alter caught in the mazes
was frightened to stay put by the demons that surrounded it. (This is so
well portrayed in Labyrinth.) This happens in real life to Monarch
alters which stray into the mazes. They are lost and then they cant
come out and take the body. They are simply lost in the mind. The old
hag gives her slippers! Slippers are important triggers or cues to go
places internally. She is given a horsey and told she loves it. Take
back the child you have stolen. A ferris wheel is shown. (Carrousels
were used greatly in programming.) Then she breaks an hour glass. Hour
glasses are internal clocks.
Then she encounters levels, doors and
tunnels. An Iron robot representing Thor comes out and bangs bangs
bangs. The banging is the split brain headaches that the internal Thor
causes the victims mind to experience. A child is placed into the
robot. Often during the programming, child alters are programmed to put
on a robot like suit and serve with other children as clone solders in a
clone army. (The sea divers of the Walt Disney movie 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea were used to program child alters into how they were to
get into robot suits.) These child alters form armies that attack if an
alter tries to fight the programming. These children alters are like
children screaming--it is impossible to reason or talk to them.
Armies
of these alters are difficult to stop in the mind. In the programming,
the brave are told they are brave and vice-versa. The character says I
have no courage. But is told You are a man of courage. More clocks
and a bell appears. A red and blue guardian appear. Perhaps these colors
represent the color programming. Rocks and cannons represent the
protectors and the earthquakes they cause internally in a Monarchs
mind. When she enters the castle it is a carbon copy of Eshers drawing
entitled Relativity. (See The Graphic Work of MC. Esher, figure 67.)
She runs up stairs and gets nowhere. Eschers drawing, according to
ex-programmers, are used for programming.
The Master sings, Everything
Ive done, Ive done for you. David appears everywhere from every
angle. This is how the internal programmers, which are clones of the
real programmers appear everywhere in the mind of the slave. He sings,
Just as I can be so cruel...look without your heart beat. ..I must live
within you.
She says, Give me the child [the core] and the
programmer says, I have been generous. ..but I can be so cruel .... I
have reordered time...turned the world upside down...all for you. The
internal and external programmers can be cruel. The victim is trauma
bonded to them. They are cruel and kind to the victim, just like Mengele
was to his thousands of victims. The internal worlds can be turned in a
Monarch system, by turning the hour glasses which are on X, Y and Z
axes.
The hour glasses are turned with hand signals and
codes that are similar to what pilots use to tell their degree positions
in the sky. The programmer sings, I ask for so little, just let me rule
you, and you can have everything you want...just love me, fear me, and
do as I say. He tells her that her kingdom is great. Internally alters
are given great titles, and are made queens, etc. Their internal worlds
give them all they need, and that the real external world will never
understand them. She is told repeatedly Your kingdom is great. Bow
down and worship me, and you get everything.
At this point she realizes
she has dominion over the demons. When one listens to the programming,
it seems that it is powerful and in control. The movie does a good job
of showing how a slaves mind has both an internal and an external
world. A hall appears with daisies. Daisies were used in programming.
When she leaves the internal world, she finds that the internal world is
right there with her in her external world. She is surrounded by
internal cues. Then she embraces and accepts her internal world
toward the ending of the movie. Many systems have an owl in their
system which represents the master. In the movie, an owl representing
the master appears at various times & then flies away at the end. Toward
the end the Master sings, Power of Voodoo...
The internal world is
full of goblins, dwarfs, worms, a hat, door knockers, Fury 1,2,3,4,5 and
many other things. Ravens are in the movie. In real life, the
programmers take alter fragments, which are splits which are not
developed into full blown personalities and they program them to have a
single task, for instance to think they are a raven and to bite the body
when ever they take the body.
Whole flocks of demons which take the form
of ravens may wait inside the mind waiting for their release to bite the
body. When triggered by the internal programmers when an alter crosses
the boundaries set down by the programming, a flock of ravens may come
forward and take the body (as they say in MPD) of the slave and the
Monarch slave will bite his or her flesh and viciously tear it with its
teeth. By watching the movie Labyrinth, and using this as a guide, the
viewer will begin to understand the horror and control that the internal
world holds over the alters of a Monarch slave.
Few Monarch slaves ever
tell other people what is going on in their minds, now you have been
privileged to find out. To learn this much for a Monarch slave comes
with a high price. The price is paid by reliving for a second time what
has been done to them, fighting off the suicide programs that click on
when the slaves mind disobeys. The slave must also fight off torture
memories that recycle. These torture memories are activated by the
programming when an alter disobeys its programming. As one Monarch
survivor described it to me, This all can be wrapped up by defining it
as the raping of the body, soul and spirit.
THE STRUCTURING DONE IN MONARCH STAR TREK & STAR
WARS PROGRAMMING
The original Monarch programming often used the
Wizard of Oz books and film as the basic programming. The Alice and
Wonderland story then was overlaid, along with many other fictional
fairy tales to complete the Mind Control of a Monarch Mind-controlled
slave. However, in recent years a superior story line has appeared. It
has more flexibility and more secrecy. This is the
Star Trek series. In recent years,
Star Trek is being used as a basis of programming. Those who are
programmed with Star Trek programming can attend annual Star Trek
Conventions which are held in New York City since 1972. The childs mind
is tortured until the point they will accept anything.
They are told to
build certain structures in their mind. These structures may be castles,
or rivers or submarines or airfields, etc. In the case of Star Trek
programming they have detailed maps and diagrams that have been created
to go along with the Star Trek program. (The real reason or the ulterior
motive of these Star Trek maps was to create a blueprint for
programming. Some pages of these are included for you to look at.) Then
particular alters are placed within these structures, and they are
hypnotically given cues that will pull them to the front of the mind
when the alpha-numeric cue is said. Many of the more secret alters can
only be accessed by a combination of several different cues which go to
different senses--such as the person must be in a corner contacting 3
points, a certain ring must be turned & a certain code said for the
alter to come forth.
The advantages of the Star Trek story line is that
a. almost any type of scenario can be fit into the programming script
because the Star Trek characters in the series, encounter about anything
imaginable, b. have holograms, which can serve as substitutes for mirror
images in the programming, c. alien programming can be introduced in
order to promote the mock alien invasion being planned by the
Illuminati, and d. the Star Trek series has its own language which can
be used for trigger codes, which Monarch slaves can study, and learn.
The use of this klingon language will make it very difficult for
ordinary people to break into the slaves programming.
Michael Aquino,
Satanist and Colonel in the U.S. army, has enjoyed using Star Wars for
programming. Aquino wrote his own version of the Star Wars, which he
uses for programming. The programmer becomes Darth Vader, which then is
reproduced as an alter within the victim. In the Star Trek series, Data
was a dehumanized person who stored vast amounts of information.
Monarch slaves are always created with libraries, and volumes of
information. This information is stored in various ways and can be
retrieved in a variety of ways.
Data of Star Trek lends himself to
become the model for an alter of a Monarch system to copy. In other
words the child is shown Data, and is steered in the right direction to
create an internal person named Data. Any child if it is drugged,
tortured, threatened with death if they dont follow directions, with
weakened and confused minds will get to the point where the child will
create a Data alter in its mind, rather than die. Once in place, the
Data alter will think of itself as the movie character. Every time the
child sees Star Trek or pictures of Data, it will reinforce the
programming.
The transformer room technique of beaming in Star Trek is
what magicians have tried to do for centuries and which has been called
bi-location-physical projection as well as other things. This is said
in magic to be mental control over the molecules of the body via demonic
power. Whether magicians have ever done this, who knows, some certainly
claim the power. The Illuminist is a power structure placed into some
Monarch slaves. It is constructed from parts of numerous demons, rather
like a demonic Frankenstein, & is portrayed in Star Trek, the Next Gener. as the crystalline body.
A cartoon series was created for Star
Trek. In this series, children watch such things as Kirk in a magical
universe of Megas-tu which has a Guardian of Forever. Two other spin-out
shows were Deep Space Nine and S.T. Voyager. In other words, a child
could watch 5 different Star Trek series. If the childs parents had
cable T.V. the child be virtually immersed into the various Star Trek
shows. Unfortunately, some of the children who have been programmed with
this are doing exactly that.
Fritz has personally worked with someone who
has Star Trek programming. They sit for hours and immerse themselves
totally into all kinds of Star Trek details. We have two Star Trek
Technical Manuals. Fritzs father is an engineer and designed quite a
few things. Fritz himself has worked as a manual/computer draftsperson
for the Federal Highway Administration as well as for his father off and
on over the years. Based on that experience, he realizes the enormous
amount of work that went into these Technical Manuals for the Star Trek
series is simply mindboggling. One manual is 183 pages and the other is
in the neighborhood of 250 pages. The amount of engineering and computer
drafting that went into these manuals is astonishing. Why did someone go
to such extremes?
These manuals are as good as if NASA were planning to
build an Enterprise spaceship. The plans are done more professionally
than engineering designs that we have seen groups like the United
Nations drawing up. Why did all this engineering, design and drafting
happen for a fictional T.V. show? To create a book to sell? The books..
could hardly be best sellers. One originally sold for $13 U.S. and the
other for $6.95. One reason so much work and money was put into these
Technical Manuals is that they are used for programming helpless victims
of the Monarch Mind-Control.
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE DESCRIPTIONS OF WHY THE
EXHIBITS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PROGRAMMING.
The
Technical (or Training) Manual pages are coded.
Exhibit 1. Star Fleet Technical Order. (TM:379260-1)
This page show
codes on the far left that are similar to the type of codes used in
Monarch access codes. Alters are trained to take the body upon the
proper access code. Also certain activities or programs can be triggered
by codes also.
Exhibit 2. Uniform Color Code. (TM:379260-0)
In creating a System
within the slaves mind, geometric shapes are used. Within these shapes
a number of worlds or universes will be created. These worlds can be
3-D. That means when building them in the childs mind they can have
height, depth, and width. One system which I have seen several times in
slaves has been a 13 x 13 x 13 cube. In order to give another dimension
and to give the programmers the ability to tie different things in
different parts of the system together--the programmers use color
coding. Each alter will receive a color code. I am familiar with the
standard color coding program, and how it is put into the childs mind.
Dr. Green (Mengele) used a box of colored scarfs and electroshock to
program in the color coding into victims mind. Besides alters, other
things in the system may be color coded also. Lets say as Programmers
we place hidden observers on each level, system or world. Then we can
tie those isolated alters together by color coding them the same. During
the programming, computers are built into the mind to operate the
programming, and they send their signals according to color coding.
Exhibit 3. MILKY WAY GALAXY MAP. (TM379260-2)
This is just one of a number of maps
that go with the Star Trek programming. During the programming (which is
sophisticated torture of all kinds backed up w/ drugs) the childs mind
will be encouraged to psychotically build worlds in his or her mind.
These worlds are built with vortexes, mine fields, and in the case of
Star Trek programming Radiation zones. If an alter would attempt to
wander from its assigned spot in the mind, it will run into Radiation
zones, walls, and other barriers. These zones are built into the mind,
to insure that the multiple personalities do not contact each other.
Aliens and holograms protect certain areas and prevent personalities
from freely moving around in the mind. These aliens are placed into
the victims mind by high level demonology--in other words they are not
aliens--they are demons which have been brought in by high level
rituals.
Exhibit 4. 4.1 COMPUTER SYSTEM (p.50)
The first thing created are
the multiple personalities. Then these personalities are placed into a
structured system. To operate that structured system and to insure
compliance the Monarch programmer will put in what is called Omega
programming. Omega programming consists of computers, wiring, conduits
and cords. The most important part are the computers. These computers
contain the instructions, and they are controlled by internal
programmers who may be alters or who may be high level demons. The
aliens (demons) who are placed strategically in the mind to keep the
Omega programming intact are put in by sophisticated high level
demonology. The high level demonology part of the programming is the
most secret and it is termed Gamma programming. This is a diagram which
could be used to help build into the childs mind a computer. In the
early programming, a little girl while being tortured would be shown a
multi-roomed dollhouse. The rooms would each have a separate color. The
rooms would be linked in the childs mind to computers. In other
words--the dollhouse structure was the structure the computers used. In
the Star Trek programming, the modern child simply is given a
multi-roomed computer like the one drawn.
Exhibit 5. TM:379260-3 ENGINEERING MAIN BRIDGE SECTION.
Various
methods of communication and travel within a Monarch systems mind will
be built in. Various alters are allowed contact with other alters.
Portals and one-way mirrors or one-way windows are built in also. In
order to teach an alter to come to the front of the mind, an airplane
taking off on a runway might be used as a visual aid to teaching how to
leave the alters cubicle in the mind and come forward to take the body.
Various internal communication systems can be built into the System.
The training manual is full of many possible communication and
locomotion devices, and this is just one of a whole number of items that
could be incorporated into a Monarch childs mind as it is programmed.
Exhibit 6. pg. 82. UTILITIES.
The brain stems are scarred on babies
and when the body rebuilds itself it overcompensates and the brain gets
an incredible memory. Monarch slaves with scarred brain stems are
running the computer systems for the New World Order. If the slave has a
photographic memory as many of them do, then a specific chart like this
utility chart could function as the blueprint for the mind when it
creates its power packs. Power packs, and energy cells (sometimes put in
like light bulbs) run the computers which are built into the slaves
mind. This is part of what is called the Omega programming.
Exhibit 7. TM:379260-2 S.I.N.S.
Base Datum. This is a coordinate
system. In the early years the Monarch systems were built with 3 hour
glasses each spinning on a x,y, or z axis. The hour glasses could be
turned and in so doing the entire system of alters could be turned.
Lets say that we have a slave and we have created great Christian front
alters. Now, we decide that the time has come to use the dark Satanic
alters full time. Since the dark alters are hidden at the bottom of the
system, we need to rotate the System 180 degrees so that the Satanic
alters are now on top. Now the Satanic alters will receive extra energy
to be out holding the body full time. This SINS Base Datum is a way of
making a coordinate system for a Monarch System. Certain codes would
then be given the System to make a shift when the handler needs to turn
a System.

Darth Vader cover of Warren Magazine, plus the next
two pages. This final exhibit consists of not one but 3 pages which are
the first 3 pages of a article written by Michael Aquino. This article
is Michael Aquinos own version of Star Wars.
It is this version that he wrote and then used to
program Monarch Mind-Controlled slaves. Actually to give credit where
credit is due, an army colonel (who has since moved to Santa Fe, NM) at
the Armys War College worked with Michael Aquino at designing
mind-control programming around the Star Wars script.
