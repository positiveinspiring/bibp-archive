The White House claims
(read top page
report) even after the release that these
pages, prove that Saudis had nothing to with the
attack.
While there is, one
might say, no smoking gun, there is plenty of
circumstantial evidence that there were contacts
between hijackers and individuals who were
associated with the Saudi government.
The full redacted text
of the 28 pages can be read
here.
Many political figures
such as former Sen. Bob Graham and
Congressman Rick Nolan have long been calling
for release of the pages.
Graham claimed the
pages point a "very strong finger at Saudi Arabia."
The report admits:
"While in the United
States, some of the September 11th
hijackers were in contact with or received
assistance from, individuals who may be
connected with the Saudi government."
FBI sources also
believed that at least two of those individuals were
Saudi intelligence agents.
The
Intercept reports:
One of the most
notable figures mentioned is Omar al-Bayoumi,
alleged by the report to have likely been a
Saudi intelligence agent.
Al-Bayoumi was in
close contact with hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi and
Khalid al-Midhar, providing them financial
assistance during their time in the United
States and even helping them find an apartment.
Bayoumi in turn
is believed to have been on the payroll of the
Saudi Ministry of Defense and was regularly in
receipt of large lump sums of money from the
Saudi Ministry of Finance and other undisclosed
arms of the government.
Bayouni was supposedly
an employee of Ercan, a subsidiary of a company with
substantial ties to the Saudi Defense Ministry.
He was only confirmed to
have gone to Ercan once. Nevertheless he received a
$465 per month "allowance" from the company. After
he met with the hijackers this was increased to
$3,700 a month. Bayouni's wife also received $1200 a
month from the wife of the former ambassador to the
US.
The two kept receiving
the money until they left the US in July or early
August of 2001.
Another important figure
is Osama Bassnan a Saudi-citizen and
associate of al-Bayoumi who lived in an apartment
close by al-Hazmi and al-Midhar. He is reported to
have said to the FBI that he did more for the
hijackers than al-Bayoumi did.
Bassnan and his wife
received regular payments from the wife of former
Saudi Ambassador to the US Prince Bandar bin
Sultan. On one occasion Bassnan was said to have
received a check directly from the prince's account.
Bassnan said he was
introduced to the hijackers by Bayouni.
The CIA says they
believe Bassman got a fake passport from the Saudi
government. He was a known supporter of Al Qaeda,
and had spoken of bin Laden as being like a
god as far back as 1992.
The money given to his
wife by the wife of Prince Bandar bin Sultan
totaling $74,000 dollars was supposedly for nursing
services but there was no evidence such services
were ever provided.
Saleh al-Hussayen,
described as a Saudi Interior Ministry employee or
official, stayed in the same hotel as one of the
hijackers in the days before the attack.
When interviewed by FBI
officials, he kept passing out or feigning a
seizure, terminating the interview. He later fled
the US. Much of the material in the pages is not new
but confirms statements already made.
The Saudi government
said that it welcomed the release of the pages
claiming that they exonerate Saudi Arabia of any
direct role in the attacks. However, it certainly
does point to persons associated with the Saudi
Government as having helped some of the hijackers.
The report notes that
Saudi authorities consistently refused to cooperate
with investigators who were trying to discover more
information about the hijackers. FBI agents and CIA
officers complained to the 9/11 inquiry that the
Saudis often failed to cooperate both before and
after the 9/11 attack.
The report also mentions
that several Saudi Naval officers had contact with
the hijackers before the attack, but the entire
section on this is mostly redacted so the details
are not known.
The Joint Inquiry tended
to make light of the considerable evidence of Saudi
involvement presented by the FBI and CIA claiming
that the reports were not independently confirmed
and that there could be "innocent explanations" for
the aid provided to the hijackers.
In spite of the spin put
on what is in the pages by the US government and the
Saudis, the pages contain plenty of circumstantial
evidence supporting those who claim that the Saudis
played a significant role in helping out at least
some of the hijackers
