The Wall Street Journal
reported on January 19th that
the Obama Administration was pushing heavily to get the 50 state attorneys
general to agree to a settlement with five major banks in the robo-signing
scandal.
The scandal involves employees signing names not
their own, under titles they did not really have, attesting to the veracity
of documents they had not really reviewed. Investigation reveals that it did
not just happen occasionally but was an industry-wide practice, dating back
to the late 1990s; and that it may have clouded the titles of millions of
homes.
If the settlement is agreed to, it will let Wall
Street bankers off the hook for crimes that would land the rest of us in
jail - fraud, forgery, securities violations and tax evasion.
To the Presidents credit, however, he seems to have
shifted his position on the settlement in
response to protests before his State of the Union address.
In his speech on January 24th,
President
Obama did not mention the settlement
but announced instead that he would be creating a mortgage crisis unit to
investigate wrongdoing related to real estate lending.
This new unit will hold accountable those
who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the
page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans, he said.
The Deeper Question Is
Why
Whether massive robo-signing occurred is no longer in issue.
The question that needs to be investigated is
why it was being done. The alleged justification - that the bankers were so
busy that they cut corners - hardly seems credible given the extent of the
practice.
The robo-signing largely involved assignments of mortgage notes to mortgage
servicers or trusts representing the investors who put up the loan money.
Assignment was necessary to give the trusts legal title to the loans.
But assignment was delayed until it was
necessary to foreclose on the homes, when it had to be done through the
forgery and fraud of robo-signing.
Here is a working hypothesis,
suggested by Martin Andelman:
securitized mortgages are the pawns used
in the pawn shop known as the repo market.
Repos are overnight sales and repurchases of
collateral.
Yale economist Gary Gorton
explains that repos are the deposit
insurance for the shadow banking system, which is now larger than the
conventional banking system and is necessary for the conventional system to
operate. The problem is that repos require sales, which means the mortgage
notes have to remain free to be bought and sold.
The mortgages are left unendorsed so they can be
used in this repo market.
The Evolution of the
Shadow Banking System
Gorton observes that there is a massive and growing demand for banking by
large institutional investors - pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds,
sovereign wealth funds - which have millions of dollars to park somewhere
between investments.
But
FDIC insurance covers only up to $250,000.
FDIC insurance was resisted in the 1930s by bankers and government officials
and was pushed through as a populist movement: the people demanded it. What
they got was enough insurance to cover the deposits of individuals and no
more.
Today, the large institutional investors want
similar coverage. They want an investment that is secure, that provides them
with a little interest, and that is liquid like a traditional deposit
account, allowing quick withdrawal.
The shadow banking system evolved in response to this need, operating
largely through the repo market. Repos are sales and repurchases of highly
liquid collateral, typically Treasury debt or mortgage-backed securities -
the securitized units into which American real estate has been ground up and
packaged, sausage-fashion.
The collateral is bought by a special purpose
vehicle (SPV),
which acts as the shadow bank.
The investors put their money in the SPV and
keep the securities, which substitute for FDIC insurance in a traditional
bank. (If the SPV fails to pay up, the investors can foreclose on the
securities.) To satisfy the demand for liquidity, the repos are one-day or
short-term deals, continually rolled over until the money is withdrawn.
This money is used by the banks for other
lending, investing or speculating.
Gorton
writes:
This banking system (the shadow or
parallel banking system) - repo based on securitization - is a genuine
banking system, as large as the traditional, regulated banking system.
It is of critical importance to the economy
because it is the funding basis for the traditional banking system.
Without it, traditional banks will not lend and credit, which is
essential for job creation, will not be created.
All Behind the Curtain
of MERS
The housing shell game was made possible because it was all concealed behind
an electronic smokescreen called
MERS (an acronym for Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems, Inc.).
MERS allowed houses to be shuffled around among
multiple, rapidly changing owners while circumventing local recording laws.
Title would be recorded in the name of MERS as a place holder for the
investors, and MERS would foreclose on behalf of the investors. Payments
would be received by the mortgage servicer, which was typically the bank
that signed the mortgage with the homeowner.
The homeowner usually thinks the servicer is the
lender, but in fact it is an amorphous group of investors.
This all worked until
courts started questioning whether MERS,
which admitted that it was a mere conduit without title, had standing to
foreclose. Courts have increasingly held that it does not.
Making matters worse for the servicing banks, Fannie Mae sent out a memo
telling servicers that in order to be reimbursed under
HAMP - a government loan modification
program designed to help at-risk homeowners meet their mortgage payments -
the servicers would have to produce the paperwork showing the loan had been
assigned to the trust.
The hasty solution was a rash of assignments signed by an army of robosigners,
to be filed in the public records. But the documents are patent forgeries,
making a shambles of county title records.
Complicating all this are tax issues. Since 1986, mortgage-backed securities
have been issued to investors through SPVs called
REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment
Conduits). REMICs are designed as tax shelters; but to qualify for that
status, they must be static.
Mortgages cant be transferred in and out once
the closing date has occurred.
The REMIC Pooling and Servicing Agreement
typically states that any transfer significantly after the closing date is
invalid. Yet the newly robo-signed documents, which are required to begin
foreclosure proceedings, are almost always executed long after the trusts
closing date.
The whole business is
quite complicated, but the bottom line is
that title has been clouded not only by MERS but because the trusts
purporting to foreclose do not own the properties by the terms of their own
documents.
John OBrien, Register of Deeds for the Southern Essex District of
Massachusetts, calls it a criminal enterprise. On January 18th,
he
called for a full scale criminal investigation,
including a grand jury to look into the evidence.
He sent to,
-
Massachusetts Attorney General Martha
Coakley
-
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
-
U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz,
...over 30,000 documents recorded in the Salem
Registry that he says are fraudulent.
From Lending Machines
to Borrowing Machines
The bankers have engaged in what amounts to a massive fraud, not necessarily
because they started out with criminal intent, but because they have been
required to in order to come up with the collateral (in this case real
estate) to back their loans.
It is the way our system is set up: the banks
are not really creating credit and advancing it to us, counting on our
future productivity to pay it off, the way they once did under the deceptive
but functional fa√ßade of fractional reserve lending.
Instead, they are vacuuming up our money and
lending it back to us at higher rates.
Instead of lending into the economy, says
British money reformer Ann Pettifor, bankers are borrowing from the
real economy.
She wrote in the Huffington Post in
October 2010:
[T]he crazy facts are these: bankers now
borrow from their customers and from taxpayers. They are effectively
draining funds from household bank accounts, small businesses,
corporations, government Treasuries and from e.g. the
Federal Reserve.
They do so by charging high rates of
interest and fees; by demanding early repayment of loans; by illegally
foreclosing on homeowners, and by appropriating, and then speculating
with trillions of dollars of taxpayer-backed resources.
Not only has the system destroyed county title
records, but it is highly vulnerable to bank runs and systemic collapse.
In the shadow banking system, as in the
old fractional reserve banking system, the collateral is being
double-counted:
it is owed to the borrowers and the
depositors at the same time.
This allows for expansion of the money supply,
but bank runs can occur when the borrowers and the depositors demand their
money at the same time.
And unlike the conventional banking system, the
shadow banking system is largely unregulated. It doesnt have the backup of
FDIC insurance to prevent bank runs.
That is what happened in September 2008 following the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers, a major investment bank.
Gary Gorton explains that it was a
run on the shadow banking system that caused the credit collapse that
followed. Investors rushed to pull their money out overnight. LIBOR - the
London interbank lending rate for short-term loans - shot up to around 5%.
Since the cost of borrowing the money to cover
loans was too high for banks to turn a profit, lending abruptly came to a
halt.
Fixing the System
The question is how to eliminate this systemic risk.
As
noted by The Business Insider:
Regulate shadow banking more tightly, and
you probably have to also provide government backstops. Shudder. Try to
shut the thing down or restrict it and you suck credit out of the
system, credit which much of the non-financial 'real economy uses and
needs.
Interestingly, countries with strong public
sector banking systems largely escaped
the
2008 credit crisis.
These
include the BRIC countries - Brazil,
Russia, India and China - which contain 40% of the global population and are
todays fastest growing economies. They escaped because their public sector
banks do not need to rely on repos and securitizations to back their loans.
The banks are owned and operated by the ultimate guarantor - the government
itself.
The public sector banking model deserves further
study.
Whatever the solution, a system that requires the slicing and dicing of
mortgages behind an electronic smokescreen so they can be bought and sold as
collateral for the pawn shop of the repo market is obviously fraught with
perils and is unsustainable.
Please contact your state attorney general and
urge him or her not to go through with the robo-signing settlement, which
will be granting immunity for crimes that are not yet fully known. Phone
numbers
are here.
The surface of this great shadowy second banking
system has barely been scratched.
It needs a very thorough investigation.
