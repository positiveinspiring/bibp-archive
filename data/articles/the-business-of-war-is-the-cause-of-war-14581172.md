If you objectively and consistently observe the mainstream media and its interpretation of global events, its omissive and deceptive character soon becomes abundantly clear. This could hardly be called incompetence.
The coverage, which is popularly called "news," is in fact nothing but a propaganda mechanism, designed to persistently shape public opinion in favor of war.
Who Benefits from War? Certainly not the people on the warring sides.
People always suffer in war; their futures ruined and their lives destroyed. In fear, they look to their government to protect them, the very same government that is invested in war.
War is a dirty business that profits off death and destruction while generating blood money for the profiteers.
The people are told to look the other way, outside of their country - where the 'enemy' supposedly resides.
But what if the real enemy is inside the country, and wears expensive suits, not turbans? What if he speaks your language while living in luxury and sending his children to study at Princeton, Yale and Harvard?

While your kids are sent off to fight in fraudulent wars for corporate interests masquerading as 'patriotism'. This is in fact jingoism - a nationalized fervor of aggression, based on the notion of supremacy, and usually founded in a lust for power and riches. This mindset, of course, isn't new and is no different from Adolf Hitler's extreme nationalism, or fascism. Today we are living under the rule of oligarchical, trans-humanist, eugenicist elites that continuously consolidate power in order to control and confine humanity while methodically stripping us of the power to govern ourselves.
One of the best ways to achieve this is to keep the people in constant fear of wars and threats of terrorism, that, in reality governments themselves typically create or sponsor.
For example, we can look at the current threat of ISIS which is in fact a remodel of Al Qaida, a group the CIA created in the 1970's to fight the Russians in Afghanistan. Constant mainstream promotion of ISIS with newly released videos of beheadings and other types of inhuman cruelty is used to scare the American people into the further submission, and ever-greater losses of rights and personal freedoms.
The growing surveillance and domestic police state, and the passage of laws including the recent renewal of the Patriot Act, wouldn't be possible without always frightening the general public.
This policy ensures the constant funding of the military industrial complex, which unfortunately has taken over the government, as Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States had foreseen and warned us about on January 17, 1961:
How can we Stop the War Machine? Well, certainly not by fighting against it using its means.
That's what the machine is designed for, and an armed resistance will only be playing into its hands. After all, they've got the nukes and they will use them as they have already done in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
There must be another way to shut down this engine of death. What is the way to a global peace? Certainly it isn't paved with war how absurd! Not is it threats and rhetoric of war. Furthermore, the nuclear threat means that the situation today is dire. The wars most of us have known in our lifetimes have not been nuclear which is why you need to wake up and get involved before it happens. There are no survivors under mushroom clouds - everybody dies. There is no defense in the case of a nuclear war being unleashed - unless you were to commit yourself to living underground in a bunker for the rest of your life, without ever again seeing and feeling the sunshine. It is a death by a thousand cuts if you remain on the surface.
There is no technology to clean up radiation and take it out of the air, water and land. The half-life of nuclear radiation is 4.5 billion years, equal to the age of our planet. That means that during this time, the radioactive particles will remain as deadly as they are today.
This could be the end of all of us if nuclear war were to be released on a massive scale - a probability that is as high today as it has ever been, and growing proportionally with the insanity of politics. The cold war between the Soviet Union and USA never ended, only slowly heated up. And even though the nuclear arms race developed through paranoia, the threat of nuclear war today, is in fact a very present and real one. Realizing that war is an instrument to have us kill and be killed on behalf of corporate interests, we should be refusing the very notion of war, no matter how much we are lied to and instigated to do otherwise.
War defeats individuals and empowers institutions. Wars do not happen naturally. They are orchestrated for political and economic advantage by corporate entities for which human life is only a means to a greater enrichment.
The United States of America is not the only country in which the military industrial complex has taken over.
The same can be seen in many modern nations.
''War is good for the economy,'' is a slogan often heard on the news in Israel. But for which economy? For the economy of peace, or for the economy of war? Is it good for the people or is it good for those who are in the business of bullets and bombs?

Traveling the world and observing ordinary people, one will inevitably come to the conclusion that no one actually wants war.
Regardless of the geographical location, nationality, skin color, social status etc., people want peace, and to see their children grow. Wars, although they may appear, are not fought between people.
They are fought between military industrial factions and alliances warring for domination and control (read, All Wars are Well Planned Banker Wars, Including World War 3.) Banks financing the governments of warring sides are even more heavily involved than the war materials industries. They fund the entire game by lending money to the governments, further sinking nations in debt, while they use this money to kill each other off.
Federal spending surges as the military is mobilized. Outlays for troops, weapons and munitions increases as conflicts escalate.
Thee fraudulent and never-ending war in Iraq has already cost over 3 trillion dollars and counting - a steady flow of income for all those who are employed and benefitting from war. While the average person wants to be left alone to live his or her life in peace on either side of an orchestrated conflict, government, corporations and institutions drag us into conflict time and again.
The world has become a place where corporate interests, backed by corrupt governments, all funded by evil banks, violate human rights, freedom and dignity beyond measure.
This poses an existential threat to the survival of our species that will not abate as long as the military industrial complex maintains its grip on our society and our culture.
