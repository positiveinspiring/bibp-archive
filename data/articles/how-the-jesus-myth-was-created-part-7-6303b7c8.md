Seventh page
The
Hebrews and Jehovah
This Awareness indicates that the
Jewish people whoever that may be, generally are followers of the Old Testament,
but not necessary so. This Awareness indicates that essentially the early
Hebrews were the clones of Jehovah or the offspring of such clones. This Awareness
indicates as has been indicated previously, Jehovah indulged in the action
of duplicating entities and duplicated Adam in his image, duplicated Eve in
a kind of feminine counterpart of Adam using a different approach. This Awareness
indicates that these entities as having been created on the planet Mars, and
brought to Earth at the time whereby they were expelled from the Garden of
Eden. This Awareness indicates that the action of Jehovah as has been previously
indicated, was one whereby he broke certain Universal Laws of the Galactic
Confederation in creating Adam and Eve as servants to tend his garden, and
began this race which was a duplicate of his own karmic self.
This Awareness wishes to elaborate
briefly: The actions of
Jehovah created through the DNA duplication a race
of Hebrews, who were basically reflections of Jehovah--these entities reflecting
the rebellious attitudes of Jehovah and carrying on certain attitudes of superiority,
love of power, jealousy, vengeance and a feeling of being righteous and superior
to others. This Awareness indicates all this being inherited through the genes
from Jehovah. This Awareness indicates the Intergalactic Confederation, or
Galactic Man, as it is sometimes called, considered Jehovah to be a renegade
immortal and has since curbed Jehovah's behavior and has sentenced this entity
to bring back the energies which he unleashed upon this Earth; and this entity
is in the process of reversing the forces which he unleashed, and in doing
so, the entity is also making repayment for his own karmic purposes.
This Awareness indicates the entity
Jesus, as has been explained previously, assisted to reverse the forces which
this entity Jehovah began, and Jehovah at present is not in the process of
destroying humanity and saving his own, but rather is in the process of balancing
out the energies of this planet in order to bring about harmony and to undo
the harm which he unleashed when began his operations. This Awareness reminds
entities that the term "Jehovah" as likened unto that which applies
to a tribe of space people with one named Yahweh as the leader, and this entity
as being the force behind this action. This Awareness indicates that these
entities are working on this Earth to undo some of the energies which have
brought about much conflict through the Hebrews and their programming by Yahweh.
Jehovah
Planned to return and Harvest his People
This Awareness indicates the entity
Jehovah had intended to return at the proper time and to take those who were
his creation away from this planet, to another place, and to destroy the remaining
entities upon this planet. It was for this reason that the entity Jesus came
from the Intergalactic Confederation, after having moved into Terrestria from
Celestria, and through these entities moved into the earth plane, and was
born, and remained in contact with these space beings while moving through
the various places which Jehovah had touched, and fulfilling various prophecies
which Jehovah had promised to fulfill and thereby diffusing or duplicating
the actions of Jehovah but on a different level.
This Awareness indicates the entity
Jehovah had promised to come back with great power and slay the enemies of
the Hebrews and take them away to the promised land. The entity Jesus came
back as a babe in the manger, giving himself for others. This Awareness indicates
the entity being King of the Hebrews, rode into Jerusalem on an ass, and was
crowned with a cross of thorns. This Awareness indicates this entire action,
the mercy and the healings indicated a God of love and mercy, and many of
the Hebrews began to believe this entity was indeed a messiah, but a messiah
not of power, vengeance and glory but of humanness, love and mercy, and the
entity opened the Hebrew religion for Gentiles also, this again diffusing
the Jewish of Hebrew religion, diffusing the Hebrew clan.
This Awareness indicates Jehovah
had created many laws to identify his people, ranging from circumcision to
diet and to other forms of behavior, to the action of keeping track of the
genealogy. This Awareness indicates this entity had intended to mark his people
that he might come back and salvage them, but the entity Jesus began an action
which diffused and scattered these people all over the Earth, and in this
manner made the harvest a near impossibility.
This Awareness indicates that Jehovah
has had to reconsider his plan for harvesting or rapturing his people and
destroying those who were not his own. This Awareness indicates the entity
as having to give up on that program. This Awareness suggests there was a
deficiency in the gene of Jehovah, which, while helping this entity to be
a good scientist, did not allow the entity to understand qualities of mercy
and universal oneness. This Awareness indicates the entity as having been
vain and self-centered -- a megalomania. This Awareness indicates the entity
as having passed this on to his followers, to his duplicates, Adam and Eve,
and through them to others of the Hebrew group, and that many of these entities
while being artistic and adept at dealing with material physics and materialism,
did not have certain qualities which linked them to the Immortal Realm, and
therefore many of these entities adopted the philosophy of atheism, not believing
that immortality actually existed.
