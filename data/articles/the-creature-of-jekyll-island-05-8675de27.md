THE HARVEST
Monetary and political
scientists continue to expound the theoretical merits of the
Federal Reserve System.
It has become a modern act of
faith that economic life simply could not go on without it.
But the time for theory is past The Creature moved into its
final lair in 1913 and has snorted and thrashed about the
landscape ever since.
If we wish to know if it is a
creature of service or a beast of prey, we merely have to
look at what it has done.
And, after the test of all those
years, we can be sure that what it has done, it will
continue to do. Or, to use the Biblical axiom, a tree shall
be known by the fruit it bears. Let us now examine the
harvest.

THE LONDON CONNECTION
The rise of the House of Morgan; Morgan's ties with England and the House of
Rothschild; the connection between the Federal Reserve System and the Bank
of England; the Fed's decision to inflate American dollars to assist the
ailing British economy.
The period between the Civil War and the enactment of the federal Reserve
System was one of great economic volatility and no small measure of chaos.
The National Banking Acts of 1863-65 established a system of federally
chartered banks which were given significant privilege and power over the
monetary system. They were granted a monopoly in the issuance of bank
notes, and the government agreed to accept those notes for the payment of
taxes and duties. They were allowed to back this money up to ninety per
cent with government bonds instead of gold.
And they were guaranteed that
every bank in the system would have to accept the notes of every other bank
at face value, regardless of how shaky their position.
The net effect was
that the banking system of the United States after the Civil War, far from
being free and unregulated as some historians have claimed, was literally a
halfway house to central banking.
The notion of being able to generate prosperity simply by creating more
money has always fascinated politicians and businessmen, but at no time in
our history was it more in vogue than in the second half of the nineteenth
century. The nation had gone mad with the Midas complex, a compulsion to
turn everything into money through the magic of banking.
Personal checks gradually had become accepted in commerce just as readily as bank notes,
and the banks obliged their customers by entering into their passbooks just
ms many little numbers as they cared to "borrow."
As Groseclose
observed:
"The manna of cheap money became the universal cry, and as with
the Israelites, the easier the manna was acquired, the louder became the
complaint, the less willing the people to struggle for it."
The prevailing philosophy of that time was aptly expressed by Jay Cooke, the
famous financier who had marketed the huge Civil War loans of the federal
government and who now was raising $100 million for the Northern Pacific
Railroad.
Cooke had published a pamphlet which was aptly summarized by its
own title:
How Our National Debt May Be a National Blessing - The Debt is
Public Wealth, Political Union, Protection of Industry, Secure Basis for
National Currency.
"Why" asked Cooke, "should this Grand and Glorious
country be stunted and dwarfed - its activities chilled and its very life
blood curdled by these miserable 'hard coin' theories - the musty theories
of a bygone age."
As it turned out, however, the chilling and curdling came,
not from the musty hard-coin theories of the past, but from the glittering
easy-money theories of the present.
The Northern Pacific went bankrupt and,
as the mountain of imaginary money invested in it collapsed back into
nothing, Cooke's giant investment firm disappeared along with it, triggering
the panic of 1873 as it went.
Matthew Josephson writes:
"All about the failure of Jay Cooke!" newsboys hawked throughout the
country....
The largest and most pious bank in the Western world had fallen with the
effect of a thunderclap. Soon allied brokers and national banks and 5,000
commercial houses followed it into the abyss of bankruptcy.
All day long, in
Wall Street, one suspension after another was announced; railroads failed;
leading stocks lost 30 to 40 points, or half their value, within the hour;
immeasurable waves of fear altered the movement of greed; the exchanges were
closed; the stampede, the "greatest" crisis in American history, was on.
AND STILL MORE BOOMS AND BUSTS
Altogether, there were four major contractions of the money supply during
this period:
the so-called panics of 1873, 1884, 1893, and 1907.
Each of
them was characterized by inadequate bank reserves and the suspension of
specie payment.
Congress reacted, not by requiring an increase in reserves
which would have improved the safety margin, but by allowing a decrease. In
June of 1874, legislation was passed which permitted the banks to back their
notes entirely with government bonds.
That, of course, meant more fiat money
for Congress, but it also meant that bank notes no longer had any specie
backing at all, not even ten per cent. This released over $20 million from
bank reserves which then could be used as the basis for pyramiding even more
checkbook money into the economy.
It has become accepted mythology that these panics were caused by seasonal
demands for farm loans at harvest time. To supply those funds, the country
banks had to draw down their cash reserves which generally were deposited
with the larger city banks.
This thinned out the reserves held in the
cities, and the whole system became more vulnerable. Actually that part of
the legend is true, but apparently no one is expected to ask questions about
the rest of the story.
Several of them come to mind.
-
Why wasn't there a
panic every Autumn instead of just every eleven years or so?
-
Why didn't all
banks - country or city - maintain adequate reserves to cover their
depositor demands?
-
And why didn't they do this in all seasons of the year?
-
Why would merely saying no to some loan applicants cause hundreds of banks
to fail?
The myth falls apart under the weight of these questions.
The truth is that, if it hadn't been seasonal demand by agriculture, the
money magicians simply would have found another scapegoat. It would have
been "immobile" reserves, lack of "elasticity" in the money supply,
"imbalance" of international payments, or some other technocratic smoke
screen to cover the real problem which was - and always has been -
fractional-reserve banking itself.
The bottom line was that, in spite of an
elaborate scheme to pool the [minuscule reserves of country banks into
larger regional banks where they could be rushed from town to town like a
keg of coins on the old frontier, it still didn't work.
The loaves and
fishes stubbornly refused to multiply.
MORGAN PROSPERS WHEN OTHERS FAIL
The monetary expansions and contractions of this period were large waves
that capsized thousands of investment ships at sea.
But there was one large
vessel that, somehow, bobbed up and down with the surges quite well and
could be seen throughout the storm salvaging the abandoned cargoes of those
that were in distress. This vessel brought back to port untold riches that
once had been the property of others but now belonged to the master of the
salvage ship in accordance with rules of the high sea.
The captain's name
was J.P. Morgan.
It will be recalled from a previous section that J.P. Morgan and Company was
no small player in the world chess match called World War I. Morgan had been
chosen by the French and British governments as the official agent to sell
their war bonds in the U.S. When the war began to go badly for them, the
Morgan interests began to agitate for American entry into the conflict, a
move which was calculated to save the loans.
The Morgan firm also was the official U.S. trade
agent for Britain. In violation of international treaty, it handled the
purchase and shipping to England of all war material, including the enormous
cargo of munitions aboard the Lusitania when she went down.
The close relationship between the Morgans and Great Britain was no
accident. J.P. Morgan, Jr., was the driving force behind the
Council on
Foreign Relations, the American branch of a
secret society established by
Cecil Rhodes for the expansion of the British empire. In truth, the Morgans
were more British than American.
The reason for this is to be found in the origin of the Morgan dynasty. It
all began with an American merchant from Danvers, Massachusetts, by the name
of George Peabody. In 1837, Peabody travelled to England as a bond salesman
for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, hoping to find British investors to
replace the missing ranks of Americans who, because of a recession at that
time, showed little interest in the project.
He routinely was rejected by
the large investment houses of London but, eventually, his persistence paid
off.
Stanley Jackson, in his biography of Morgan, says of Peabody:
When the
panic [in the U.S.] at last started to subside, he called time and again on
the big City barons [in London] to assure them that Maryland and other
states would honor their bonds.
He also continued backing American
securities with his personal funds. Buying at almost giveaway levels, he
later reaped a rich harvest. He unloaded most of the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal bonds and won acclaim back home for returning his $60,000 commission
intact to Maryland's meager treasury.
It was during this trip that Peabody opened an import-export business at 22
Old Broad Street in London and began to provide [loans and letters of credit
to many of his shippers. That moved him into the investment business
specializing in transactions between Britain and the United States.
It was fortunate timing. This was the beginning of a period of rapid
expansion in the United States, accompanied by an insatiable need for
investment capital and a plethora of bond issues offering tantalizing rates
of return which were substantially higher than comparable offerings in
Europe. Peabody's firm was in an unusual [position to exploit this expanding
market, and his firm grew rapidly.
Peabody never married and, as he advanced in years, began to look for
someone to carry on the business. The qualifications for such a position
were difficult.
-
First, the man had to be an American my birth in order to
appear authentic as the representative of American investments.
-
Secondly,
he had to be British by instinct and preference. This included being well
educated and with good breeding in order to be accepted by the aristocracy
in London's financial world.
-
Third, he had to have knowledge of
Anglo-American finance.
-
And fourth, Peabody had to like him.
JUNIUS MORGAN SELECTED BY PEABODY
When the Boston merchant, Junius Morgan, met George Peabody at a London
dinner party in 1850, little did he realize that the elder financier took an
immediate liking to him and began to discreetly inquire into his background
and reputation.
This began In extended period of business and social contact
that eventually ended in 1854 when Junius moved his family to London and
became a full partner in the firm which, eventually became known as Peabody,
Morgan & Company.
In addition to selling bonds in England for American commercial ventures and
state governments, the partnership also became the chief fiscal agent for
the Union government during the Civil War, and it was during this period
that the firm's great profits bushed it into the top echelons of London's
financial fraternity.
In 1864, Peabody finally retired and completely turned
the business over to Junius who immediately changed the firm's name to J.S.
Morgan and Company.
Junius's son, John Pierpont, attended the English High School in Boston but,
during much of his youth, was enrolled in European schools and became
engulfed in British tradition. He had been born in the United States,
however, and that made him ideally suited to carry on the Anglo-American
role played so deftly by Peabody and Junius. It was inevitable that the boy
would be trained in international finance and groomed to step into his
father's shoes.
The first move was to find employment for him in 1857 at the
New York investment firm of Duncan, Sherman & Company. Seven years later, Junius acquired a competitor New York firm and set his son up as a partner
in Dabney, Morgan & Company, which became the New York branch of the London
firm.
In 1871, with the addition of a third partner, Anthony Drexel from
Philadelphia, the firm became Drexel, Morgan & Company. In 1895, following
the death of Drexel, there was a final change of name to J.P. Morgan &
Company.
A branch in Paris became known as Morgan, Harjes & Company.
AMERICANIZING THE NEW YORK BRANCH
After the unexpected death of Junius in a carriage accident a few years
later, it was decided by Pierpont to reshape the image of the London firm to
be a more British operation.
This would allow the New York branch to
represent the American side with less suspicion of being essentially the
same firm. By that time, his son, J.P. Morgan, Jr. - known as Jack by his
friends - had already been brought into the firm as a partner, and he was to
play an important role in the creation of that image.
Biographer John Forbes
tells us:
J.P. Morgan, Jr., became a partner in the London house of J.S. Morgan & Co.
on January 1,1898, and a fortnight later, with his wife Jessie and their
three children... he left New York and took up residence in England for the
next eight years.
Morgan was sent to London to do two specific things.
The first was to learn
at first hand how the British carried on a banking business under a central
banking system dominated by the Bank of England. Morgan, Sr., anticipated
the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in the United States and
wanted someone who would eventually have authority in the Morgan firms to
know how such a system worked.
The second was quietly to look about the City
and select British partners to convert the elder Morgan's privately owned J.S. Morgan & Co. into a British concern.
This eventually was accomplished by the addition of Edward Grenfell, a
long-time director of the Bank of England, as the new senior partner of what
became Morgan, Grenfell & Company. But none of this window dressing altered
the reality that J.P. Morgan & Co. in New York remained more British in
orientation than American.
A casual reading of the events of this period would lead to the conclusion
that Peabody and Morgan were fierce competitors of
the Rothschilds. It is
true they often bid against each other for the same business, but it is also
true that almost every biographer has told how the American newcomers to
London were in awe of the great power of the Rothschilds and how they
purposely cultivated their friendship, a friendship that eventually became
so intimate that the Americans were received as the personal house guests of
the Rothschilds.
The Morgan firm often worked closely with the House
of Rothschild on large joint ventures, but that was - and still is - common
practice among large investment houses.
In light of subsequent events,
however, it is appropriate to consider the possibility that an arrangement
had been worked out in which the Peabody/Morgan firm went one step further
and, on occasion, became a secret Rothschild agent.
CONCEALED ALLIANCE WITH ROTHSCHILD?
Some writers have suggested that the clandestine relationship
began almost
from the beginning.
Eustace Mullins, for example, writes:
Soon after he arrived in London, George Peabody was surprised to be summoned
to an audience with the gruff Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild.
Without mincing
words, Rothschild revealed to Peabody that much of the London aristocracy
openly disliked Rothschild and refused his invitations. He proposed that
Peabody, a man of modest means, be established as a lavish host whose
entertainments would soon be the talk of London. Rothschild would, of
course, pay all the bills.
Peabody accepted the offer and soon became known
as the most popular host in London.
His annual Fourth-of-July dinner,
celebrating American Independence, became extremely popular with the English
aristocracy, many of whom, while drinking Peabody's wine, regaled each other
with jokes about Rothschild's crudities and bad manners,
without realizing that every drop they drank had been paid for by
Rothschild.
Mullins does not give a reference for the source of this story, and one
cannot help being skeptical that such details could be proved. Nevertheless,
a secret arrangement of this kind is not as absurd as it may sound.
There is
no question that the Rothschilds were quite capable of such a clandestine
relationship and, in fact, this is exactly the kind of deception for which
they had become famous. Furthermore, there was ample reason for them to do
so. A strong anti-Semitic and anti-Rothschild sentiment had grown up in
Europe and the United States, and the family often found it to its advantage
to work through agents rather than to deal directly.
Derek Wilson tells us:
"The name 'Rothschild' was, thus, beginning to be heard in places far
removed from sophisticated London and Paris. But the connection with the
great bankers was sometimes tenuous."
That tenuous connection was precisely the role to be played by August
Belmont in the United States, and the anti-Semitism he found there was
undoubtedly the reason he changed his name from Schoenberg to Belmont upon
landing in New York in 1837.
Prior to that, the Rothschild agent had been
the firm of J.L. and S.I. Joseph & Company, about as American sounding as
one can get. It was not long, however, before the Belmont-Rothschild
connection became common knowledge, and the ploy ceased to be effective.
In 1848, the family decided to send Alphonse Rothschild to the United States
to check on Belmont's operations and to evaluate the possibility of
replacing him with a direct Rothschild representative, perhaps Alphonse
himself.
After an extended visit, he wrote home:
In a few years from now America will have attracted to itself the greater
part of trade with China and the Indies and will be enthroned between the
two oceans... The country possesses such elements of prosperity that one
would have to be blind not to recognize them...
I have no hesitation in
saying that a Rothschild house, and not just an agency, should be
established in America... Today we are presented with a fine opportunity.
Later on, difficulties will of necessity arise as a result of competition
from all sides.
Some historians have expressed amazement over the fact that |he
recommendation was never acted upon.
Wilson says:
"This was the greatest
opportunity the Rothschilds ever lost."
Those with a more skeptical bent
are tempted to wonder if the opportunity really mm lost or if it was merely
taken in a more indirect fashion.
It is Significant that, precisely at this
time, George Peabody was making a name for himself in London and had
established a close relationship with Nathan Rothschild. Is it possible that
the Peabody firm was given the nod from the Rothschild consortium to
represent them in America?
And is it possible that the plan included
allowing Belmont to operate as a known Rothschild agent while using Peabody
& Company as an unknown agent, thus, providing their own competition?
John Moody answers:
"The Rothschilds were content to remain
a close ally of Morgan rather than a competitor as far as the American field was
concerned."
Gabriel Kolko says:
"Morgan's Activities in 1895-1896 in selling
U.S. gold bonds in Europe were based on his alliance with the House of
Rothschild."
Sereno Pratt pays:
"These houses may, like J.P. Morgan &
Company... represent there the great firms and institutions of Europe, just
as August Belmont & Company have long represented the Rothschilds."
And George Wheeler writes:
"Part of the reality of the day was an ugly
resurgence of anti-Semitism... Someone was needed as a cover. Who better
than J. Pierpont Morgan, a solid, Protestant exemplar of capitalism able to
trace his family back to pre-Revolutionary times?" 5

RISE OF THE HOUSE OF MORGAN
With these considerations as background, the meteoric rise of Morgan's star
over London and Wall Street can be readily understood.
It is no longer
surprising, for example, that Peabody & Company was the sole American
investment firm to receive a gigantic loan from the Bank of England during
the U.S. panic of 1857, a loan which not only saved it from sinking, but
made it
possible to seize and salvage many other ships that were then capsized on
Wall Street.
Peabody had become active in the business of discounting acceptances, which
is banker language for insuring commercial loans issued for the purchase of
goods.
This is how it works:
The seller issues a bill with a stipulation
that he must be paid at a future date, usually ninety days. When the buyer
receives the bill, his bank writes the word "accepted" across the face of it
and adds the signature of an officer, making it a legally binding contract.
In other words, the bank becomes a co-signer on the buyer's credit and
guarantees payment even if the buyer should default.
Naturally, there is a price for this guarantee.
That price is stated as a
percentage of the total bill and it is either added to the amount paid by
the buyer or deducted from the amount received by the seller. Actually there
is a fee paid at both ends of the transaction, one to the seller's bank
which receives the acceptance and pays out the money, and one to the issuing
bank which assumes the liability of guaranteeing payment.
The sale is said
to be "discounted" by the amount paid to the banks.
And so it was that
Peabody & Company had been active in the business of discounting
acceptances, primarily between sellers in England and buyers in the United
States.
MORGAN AND THE PANIC OF 1857
In the Wall Street panic of 1857, many U.S. buyers were unable to pay their
bills, and Peabody and Morgan were expected to make good on their
guarantees. Naturally, they didn't have the money, and the firm was facing
certain bankruptcy unless the money could be obtained from somewhere.
Stanley Jackson provides the details:
The slump was catastrophic for Peabody & Co. It suddenly found itself
committed to acceptances of £2 million and with no hope of discharging even
part of a stockpile of depreciating bonds on New York brokers and bankers,
themselves now desperately short of ready funds.
The firm was soon paying
out thousands of pounds a day. Without raising a large temporary loan the
partners would be forced to suspend business altogether.
1. Jackson, p. 56.
Ron Chernow, in The House of Morgan, says:
"Rumors raced through London that
George Peabody and Company was about to fail, a prospect heartily relished
by rivals... The major London houses told Morgan they would bail out the
firm - but only if Peabody shut down the bank within a year."
Jackson
continues the narrative:
The clouds lifted dramatically when the Bank of England announced a loan to
Peabody's of £800,000, at very reasonable interest, with the promise of
further funds up to a million sterling if and when required.
It was a
remarkable vote of confidence as Thomas Hankey [governor of the Bank of
England] had already rejected similar appeals from various American firms
who did not measure up to his standards... Peabody & Company recovered
almost overnight and indeed hoisted its turnover above pre-slump levels.2
With an almost unlimited access to cash and credit backed by the Bank of
England, Peabody and Morgan were able to wade hip deep through the
depreciated stocks and bonds that were sold to (them at sacrifice prices on
Wall Street.
Within only a few years, when sanity had been restored to
American markets, the assets of the firm had grown to gigantic proportions.
This event tells us a great deal about relationships. If the Rothschilds
truly had been competitors, they would have seized upon this opportunity and
used their great influence within the Bank of England and the other
investment houses in London to squeeze out Peabody, not to assist him. The
Barings, in particular, were already trying to accomplish exactly that.
The Rothschilds must have believed that a successful Peabody firm ultimately
would be in their own best interest.
ANTI-SEMITISM WAS PROFITABLE
In later years, Jack Morgan Q.P., Jr. would assume the role of a staunch
anti-Semite, and this undoubtedly strengthened his hand at dealing with
American investors and borrowers who were loath to have anything to do with
Jewish bankers.
That, of course, included officials of the U.S. Treasury. It
was particularly helpful during the 1896 rescue of the federal government
from a decline in its gold reserves. Fearing that it would not be able to
honor its promise to exchange paper money for gold coins, the government was
forced to borrow $62 million in gold. The House of Rothschild was an obvious
source for such a loan, but the Treasury wanted to avoid an anti-Semitic
backlash.
Everything fell into place, however, when Morgan and Company
became the primary lender, with Rothschild apparently demoted to the role of
a mere participant.
Wheeler writes:
The consummate politicians of the Cleveland administration ... were
certainly aware of the dangers inherent in promoting a rescue effort for the
United States Treasury that would be financed by those archetypes of
"international Jewish financiers," the Rothschilds...
During these developments, Pierpont Morgan took no direct part in the
salvage effort.
Up to this point it looked as if the aging financier - he
would be fifty-eight in two months - would be merely one among many in this
and whatever subsequent bond arrangements would be necessary.
It seemed as
though he would move on into old age with little more to round out his
obituary than his awkward attempt to profiteer on the sale of rifles at the
start of the Civil War, his minor shorting of the Union in gold trading
toward the close, and a bold but largely unsuccessful move in the 1880s to
impose an eastern capitalist cease-fire on the country's warring railroads.
But there were steps being taken even now to bring him out of the financial
backwaters - and they were not being taken by Pierpont Morgan himself. The
first suggestion of his name for a role in the recharging of the reserve
originated with the London branch of the House of Rothschild.
The apparent anti-Semitism of J.P. Morgan, Jr., was again extremely
profitable during World War 1, when it was widely publicized that the Kaiser
was funded by German-Jew bankers.
To deal with the Morgan group, therefore,
as opposed to Kuhn Loeb, for example, was in some circles almost a point of
national patriotism.
1. Wheeler, pp. 16-17.
When J.P. Morgan, Sr., died in 1913, people were shocked to learn that his
estate was valued at only $68 million, a paltry sum compared to the fortunes
held by the Vanderbilts,
Astors, and
Rockefellers.
It was even more
unbelievable when Jack Morgan died in 1943 and left an estate valued at only
$16 million.
A small amount had been transferred to members of their
families prior to their deaths, but that did not account for the vast
fortunes which they visibly controlled during their lives. Surely, there had
been a bookkeeping sleight-of-hand. On the other hand, it may have been
true. When Alphonse Rothschild died in Paris in 1905, it was revealed that
his estate contained $60 million in American securities.
The Rothschilds in Britain undoubtedly held an equally large bloc.
Furthermore, many of these securities were handled through the House of
Morgan. The possibilities are obvious that a major portion of the wealth and
power of the Morgan firm was, and always had been, merely the wealth and
power of the Rothschilds who had raised it up in the beginning and who
sustained it through its entire existence.
How much of Morgan's apparent anti-Semitism was real and how much may have
been a pragmatic guise is, in the final analysis, of little importance, and
we should not give unwarranted emphasis to it here.
Regardless of one's
interpretation of the nature of the relationship between the Houses of
Morgan and Rothschild, the fact remains that it was close, it was ongoing,
and it was profitable to both. If Morgan truly did harbor feelings of
anti-Semitism, neither lie nor the Rothschilds ever allowed them to get in
the way of their business.
To put the London connection into proper perspective, it will be necessary
once again to abandon a strict chronological sequence of events and jump
ahead to the year 1924. So let us put our cast of characters on hold for a
moment and, before allowing them to act.
Out the drama of creating the
Federal Reserve System, we shall pick up the storyline eleven years after
that event had already taken place.
ENGLAND FACES A DILEMMA
At the end of World War I, Britain faced an economic dilemma.
She had
abandoned the gold standard early in the war in order to remove all limits
from the creation of fiat money, and the result had been extreme inflation.
But now she wanted to regain her former position of power and prestige in
the world's financial markets and [decided that, to accomplish this, it
would be necessary to return to the gold standard.
It was decided, further,
to set the exchange value of the pound sterling (the British monetary unit)
at exactly $4.86 in U.S. currency, which was approximately what it had been
before the war began.
To say that she wanted to return to the gold standard actually is misleading.
It was not a pure standard in which every unit of money was totally backed
by a stated weight of gold. Rather, it was a fractional gold standard in
which only a certain fraction of all the monetary units were so backed.
But,
even that was much to be desired over no backing whatsoever for three
reasons.
-
First, it created greater consumer confidence in the money system
because of the implied promise to redeem all currency in gold - even though
such promises are always broken when based on a fractional-reserve.
-
Secondly, it provided an efficient means of settling financial accounts
between nations, gold always being the international medium of choice.
-
Thirdly, it applied some braking action to the production of fiat money,
thus, providing a certain degree of restraint to inflation and the boom-bust
cycle.
The decision to return to a fractional gold standard, therefore, while it
left much to be desired, was still a step in the right direction.
But there
were two serious problems with the plan. The first was that the exchange
value of gold can never be decided by political decree. It will always be
determined by the interplay of supply and demand within the marketplace.
Trying to fix the number of dollars which people will be willing to exchange
for a pound sterling was like trying to legislate how many baseball cards a
schoolboy will give for a purple agate.
The international currency market is
like a huge auction. If the auctioneer sets the opening bid too high, there
will be no takers - which is exactly what happened to the pound.
The other problem was that, during the war, England had adopted a massive
welfare program and a strong network of labor unions. The reason this was a
problem was that the only way to make the pound acceptable in international
trade was to allow its value to drop to a competitive and realistic level,
and that would have meant, not only a drastic reduction in welfare benefits,
but also a general lowering of prices - including the price of labor which
is called wages.
Politicians were quite willing to allow prices of
commodities to move downward, but they did not have the courage to take any
action which would reduce either welfare benefits or wages.
To the contrary,
they continued to bid for votes with promises of still more socialism and
easy credit.
Prices continued to rise.
ENGLAND IN DEPRESSION
With the value of the pound set artificially high in order to sustain
prices, wages, and profit levels, the cost of British exports also became
high, and they ceased to be competitive in world markets.
With exports in
decline, the amount of money corning into the country also declined. England
became a debtor nation, which means that her payments to other countries
were larger than her income from those countries.
As pointed out in chapter five, if an individual spends more [than his
income, he must either increase his income, dip into savings, sell off
assets, create counterfeit, or borrow. The same is true of nations. England
had already borrowed to the limit of her credit and was rapidly exhausting
her savings in order to continue purchasing [foreign goods to sustain the
high standard of living to which she had grown accustomed.
She couldn't
counterfeit because payments for these imports had to be settled in gold,
which meant that, as her national savings were spent, her gold supply moved
out of the country. The handwriting was on the wall. If this process
continued, the nation soon would be broke.
It was a situation,
incidentally, which was amazingly parallel to what has plagued the United
States since the end of Word War II, and for mostly the same reasons.
By March of 1919, England's trade was so depressed that she had no choice
but to let the value of the pound "float," which means lo seek its own level
in response to supply and demand. Within a year it had dropped to $3.21, a
loss of thirty-four per cent. Since the American dollar was the de facto
world monetary standard at that time, receiving fewer dollars for each pound
sterling meant that the pound was valued lower in all the markets of the
world.
The result was that the price Britishers had to
pay for imported goods was rooming higher while the price she received for
the export of her own goods was becoming lower. The British economy was, not only
badly
anemic, it was experiencing a monetary hangover from the vast inflation of
World War I.
In other words, it was undergoing a painful but, in the long
run, healthy recovery and a return to reality.
Such a condition was intolerable to the monetary and political scientists
who were determined to find a quick and painless remedy which would allow
the binge to continue. Several emergency therapies were administered.
The
first was to use the Financial
Committee of the League of Nations - which England dominated - to require
all the other European nations to follow similar inflationary monetary
policies. They were also required to establish what was called the "gold
exchange standard," a scheme whereby all countries based their currency, not
on gold, but on the pound sterling.
In that way, they could all inflate
together without causing a disruptive flow of gold from one to the other,
and England would act as the regulator and guarantor of the system. In other
words, England used the power of her position within the League of Nations
to establish the Bank of England as a master central bank for all the other
central banks of Europe.
It was the prototype for what the Cabal now is
doing with Federal Reserve and the World Bank within the framework of the
United Nations.
PROBLEM OF AMERICAN PROSPERITY
Europe was well in hand, but that still left the United States to be
controlled. America had also inflated during the war but not nearly as much.
She also had a fractional gold standard, but the stockpile of gold was very
large and still growing. As long as America continued to exist as the
producer of so many commodities that England needed for import, and as long
as the value of the dollar continued to be high, the anemia of the pound
sterling would continue.
The therapy chosen for this problem was simple.
Perform a monetary
transfusion from a healthy patient to the unhealthy one. All the London
financiers had to do was find a large and robust specimen who, without
asking too many questions, would be willing to become the donor.
The
specimen selected, of course, was Uncle Sam himself. It was the prototype of
the transfer mechanism, previously described, which has been the life
support keeping alwe the moribund Communist and Socialist countries since
World War II.
There are several ways the life blood of one nation can be transfused to
another.
The most direct method, of course, is to make an outright gift,
such as the bizarre American ritual called foreign aid. Another is to make a
gift disguised as something else, such as needlessly stationing military
bases abroad for the sole purpose of bolstering the foreign economy, or
granting a loan to a foreign government at below market rates or - worse -
with the full expectation that the loan will never be repaid.
But the third
way is the most ingenious of them all: to have one nation deliberately
inflate its currency at a rate greater than the other nation so that real
purchasing power, in terms of international trade, moves from the more
inflating to the less inflating nation.
This is a method truly worthy of the
monetary scientists. It is so subtle and so sophisticated that not one in a
thousand would even think of it, much less object to it. It was, therefore,
the ideal method chosen in 1925 to benefit England at the expense of
America.
As Professor Rothbard observed:
In short, the American public was nominated to suffer the burdens of
inflation and subsequent collapse [the crash of 1929] in order to maintain
the British government and the British trade union movement in the style to
which they insisted on becoming accustomed.
At the inception of the Federal Reserve System, there had been a brief
struggle for power but, within a few years, the contest was decisively won
by the head of the New York Bank, Benjamin Strong.
Strong, it will be
recalled, previously had been head of Morgan's Bankers Trust Company and was
one of the seven participants at the secret meeting on Jekyll Island.
Professor Quigley reminds us that,
"Strong owed his career to the favor of
the Morgan bank... He became Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York as the joint nominee of Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb and Company."
Strong was the ideal choice for the cartel.
Not the least of his
qualifications was his alliance with the financial powers of London. When
Montagu Norman was made the Governor of the Bank of England in 1920, there
began a close personal relationship between the two central bankers which
lasted until Strong's sudden death in 1928.
Norman was considered by many to be eccentric if not mentally unbalanced.
Quigley says:
Norman was a strange man whose mental
outlook was one of successfully suppressed hysteria or even paranoia. He
had no use for government and feared democracy. Both of these seemed to
him to be threats to private
banking, and thus to all that was proper and precious in human life...
When
he rebuilt the Bank of England, he
constructed it as a fortress prepared to defend itself against any popular
revolt, with the sacred gold reserves hidden in deep vaults below the level
of underground waters which could be released to cover them by pressing a
button on the governor's desk.
For much of his life, Norman rushed about the
world by fast steamship, covering tens of thousands of miles each year,
often travelling incognito, concealed by a black slouch hat and a long black
cloak, under the assumed name of "Professor Skinner"...
Norman had a devoted colleague in Benjamin Strong.
In the 1920s, they
were determined to use the financial power of Britain and of the United
States to force all the major countries of the world to go on the gold
standard [with an artificial value set for the benefit of England] and to
operate it through central banks free from all political control, with all
questions of international finance to be settled by agreements by such
central banks without interference from governments.
Strong and Norman spent many holidays together, sometimes in Bar Harbor,
Maine, but usually in Southern France, and they crisscrossed the Atlantic on
numerous other occasions to consult with each other on their plan for
controlling the world economy.
Lester Chandler tells us:
"Their associations
were so frequent and prolonged and their collaboration so close that it is
still impossible to determine accurately their relatwe roles in developing
some of the ideas and projects that they shared."
The Bank of England provided Strong with an
office and a private secretary during his visits, and the two men kept in
close contact with each other through the weekly exchange of private cables.
All of these meetings and communiqués were kept
in strict secrecy. When their frequent visits drew inquiries from the press,
the standard reply was that they were just friends getting together for
recreation or informal chats.
By 1926, the heads of the central banks of
France and Germany were occasionally included in their meetings which,
according to Norman's biographer, were
"more secret than any ever held by
Royal Arch Masons or by any Rosicrucian Order."
SECRET MEETING OF 1927
The culmination of these discussions took place at a secret meeting in 1927
at which it was agreed that the financial lifeblood of the American people
would be donated for a massive transfusion to Great Britain.
Galbraith sets
the scene:
On July 1, 1927, the Mauretania arrived in New York with two notable
passengers, Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, and Hjalmar
Schacht, head of the German Reichsbank... The secrecy covering the visit was
extreme and to a degree ostentatious. The names of neither of the great
bankers appeared on the passenger list. Neither, on arriving, met with
the press...
In New York the two men were joined by Charles Rist, the Deputy Governor of
the Banque de France, and they went into conference with Benjamin Strong,
the Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York...
The principle, or in any case the ultimately important, subject of
discussion was the persistently weak reserve position of the Bank of
England.
This, the bankers thought, could be helped if the Federal Reserve
System would ease interest rates, encourage lending. Holders of gold would
then seek the higher returns from keeping their metal in London. And, in
time, higher prices in the United States would ease the competitive position
of British industry and labor.
Galbraith speaks with soft phrases to cushion a harsh reality. What he is
saying is that the purpose of the meeting was to finalize a plan whereby the
Governor of the Federal Reserve System was to deliberately create inflation
in the U.S. so that American prices would rise, making U.S. goods less
competitive in world markets and causing American gold to move to the Bank
of England. Governor Strong needed little convincing.
That is precisely what
he and Norman had planned to do all along and, in fact, he had already begun
to implement the plan. The purpose of inviting the Germans and the French to
the meeting was to enlist their agreement to create inflation in their
countries as well.
Schacht and Rist would have no part of it and left the
meeting early, leaving Strong and Norman to work out the final details
between them.
1. Galbraith, pp. 174-75.
Strong was more concerned about British fortunes than American.
In a letter
written in May of 1924 to Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, he
discussed the necessity of lowering American interest rates as a step toward
money expansion with the
objective of raising American prices relative to those in Great Britain.
He
acknowledged that the goal was to protect England from having to cut back on
wages, profits, and welfare.
He said:
At the present time it is probably true that
British prices for goods internationally dealt in are as a whole,
roughly, in the neighborhood of 10 percent above our prices, and one of
the preliminaries to the re-establishment of gold payment by Great
Britain will be to facilitate a gradual readjustment of these price
levels before monetary reform is undertaken. In other words, this means
some small advance in prices here and possibly some small decline in
their prices...
The burden of this readjustment must fall more largely upon us than upon
them. It will be difficult politically and socially for the British
Government and the Bank of England to face a price liquidation in England... in face of the fact that trade is poor and they have over a million
unemployed people receiving government aid.
BRINGING DOWN THE DOLLAR
The Mandrake Mechanism of the Federal Reserve went into high gear on behalf
of the Bank of England in 1924, several years before the historic meeting
between Strong, Norman, and Rist.
There were two great surges of monetary
expansion. The first came with the monetization of $492 million in bonds
plus almost twice as much in banker's acceptances. The second burst of
inflation came in the latter half of 1927, immediately following the secret
meeting between Strong, Norman, Schacht, and Rist.
It involved the funding
of $225 million in government bonds plus $220 million in banker's
acceptances, for a total increase in bank reserves of $445 million.
At the
same time, the rediscount rate to member banks (the interest rate they pay
to borrow from the Fed) was lowered from 4 to 3.5 per cent, making it easier
for those banks to acquire additional "reserves" out of which they could
create even more fiat dollars-The amount created on top of that by the
commercial banks is about five and a-half times the amount created by the
Fed, which means a total money flood in excess of $10 billion in just six
years.
Throughout this period, the demand by the System for government bonds and
acceptances pushed interest rates down. As anticipated, people with gold
then preferred to send it to London where it could earn a higher yield, and
America's gold supply began to move abroad.
Furthermore, as inflation
began to eat its way into the purchasing power of the dollar, the prices of
American-made goods (began to rise in world markets making them less
competitive; U.S. exports began to decline; unemployment began to rise; low
interest rates and easy credit led to speculation in the securities
markets; and the system lunged full speed ahead toward the Great Crash of
1929. But that part of the story must wait for another chapter.
The technician who actually drafted the final version of the Federal Reserve
Act was H. Parker Willis. After the System was created, he was appointed as
First Secretary of the Board of Governors.
By 1929, he had become
disillusioned with the cartel and, in an article published in The North
American Review, he wrote:
In the autumn of 1926 a group of bankers, among whom was one with a world
famous name, were sitting at a table in a Washington hotel.
One of them
raised the question whether the low discount rates of the System were not
likely to encourage speculation.
"Yes," replied the conspicuous figure
referred to, "they will, but that cannot be helped. It is the price we must
pay for helping Europe."
There can be little doubt that the banker in question was J.P.
(Jack)
Morgan, Jr.
It was Jack who was imbued with English tradition from the
earliest age, whose financial empire had its roots In London, whose family
business was saved by the Bank of England, who spent six months out of every
year of his later life as a resident of England, who had openly insisted
that his junior partners demonstrate a "loyalty to Britain," and who had
directed the Council on Foreign Relations, the American branch of a secret
society dedicated to the supremacy of British tradition and political power.
It is only with that background that one can fully appreciate the
willingness to sacrifice American interests.
Indeed,
"it is the price we
must pay for helping Europe."
In spite of the growing signs of crisis in the American economy, Morgan's
protégé, Benjamin Strong, was nonetheless pleased with his accomplishment.
In a letter written in 1929 to Parker Gilbert, who was the American Agent
for Reparations, he said:
Our policy of the last four years, up to this January, has been effective in
accomplishing the purpose for which it was designed.
It has enabled monetary
reorganization to be completed in Europe, which otherwise would have been
impossible. It was undertaken with the well recognized hazard that we were
liable to encounter a big speculation and some expansion of credit... Our
course was perfectly obvious.
We had to undertake it. The conditions permitted it, and the possibility of damage abroad was at a minimum. Damage
abroad? What about damage at home? It is clear that Strong saw little
difference between the two. He was the forerunner of the internationalists
who have operated the Federal Reserve ever since.
He viewed the United
States as but one piece in a complex world financial structure, and what was
good for the world was good for America. And, oh yes, what was good for
England was good for the world!
THE BRITISH-AMERICAN UNION
It is one of the least understood realities of modern history that many of
America's most prominent political and financial figures - then as now -
have been willing to sacrifice the best interests of the United States in
order to further their goal of creating a one-world government.
The strategy
has remained unchanged since the formation of
Cecil Rhodes' society and its
offspring, the Round Table Groups. It is to merge the English-speaking
nations into a single political entity, while at the same time creating
similar groupings for other geopolitical regions. After this is
accomplished, all of these groupings are to be amalgamated into a global
government, the so-called Parliament of Man.
And guess who is planning to
control that government from behind the scenes.
1. Chandler, p. 458. For additional clarification, also see pp. 459-63-
This strategy was expressed aptly by Andrew Carnegie in his book, Triumphant
Democracy. Expressing concern that England was in decline as a world power,
he said:
Reunion with her American children is the only sure way to prevent continued
decline... Whatever obstructs reunion I oppose; whatever promotes reunion I
favor. I judge all political questions from this standpoint...
The Parliament of Man and the Federation of the World have already been
hailed by the poet, and these mean a step much farther in advance of the
proposed reunion of Britain and America... I say that as surely as the sun
in the heavens once shone upon Britain and America united, so surely is it
one morning to rise, shine upon, and greet again the reunited state, "The
British-American Union."
SUMMARY
After the Civil War, America experienced a series of expansions and
contractions of the money supply leading directly to economic booms and
busts.
This was the result of the creation of fiat money by a banking system
which, far from being free and competitive, was a half-way house to central
banking. Throughout the chaos, one banking firm, the House of Morgan, was
able to prosper out of the failure of others.
Morgan had close ties with the
financial structure and culture of England and was, in fact, more British
than American. Events suggest the possibility that Morgan and Company was in
concealed partnership with the House of Rothschild throughout most of this
period.
Benjamin Strong was a Morgan man and was appointed as the first Governor of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which rapidly assumed dominance over
the System. Strong immediately entered into close alliance with Montagu
Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, to save the English economy from
depression.
This was accomplished by deliberately creating inflation in the
U.S. which caused an outflow of gold, a loss of foreign markets,
unemployment, and speculation in the stock market, all of which were factors
that propelled America into the crash of 1929 and the great depression of
the 30s.
Although not covered in this chapter, it must be remembered that the same
forces were responsible for American involvement in both world wars to
provide the economic and military resources England needed to survive.
Furthermore, the key players in this
action were men who were part of the network of a secret society established
by Cecil Rhodes for the expansion of the British empire.
Chapter Twenty-One
COMPETITION IS A SIN
The story of how the New York investment bankers formed a cartel to avoid
competition; the drafting of proposed legislation to legalize that cartel;
the strategy to camouflage the true nature of the legislation; the failure
of the deception and the defeat of the bill.
We have travelled to many points on a large circle of time and now are
re-approaching the journey to Jekyll Island where this book began.
In the last chapter, we saw how the expansion and contraction of the money
supply following the Civil War led to a series of booms and busts. We saw
how the firm of J.P. Morgan & Company, with help from financiers in London,
was able to reap great profits from both sides of those cycles but
particularly from the recessions.
At that point, we jumped ahead in time to
examine how J.P. Morgan and other leading American financiers were closely
aligned with British interests. We also saw how, in the 1920s, the American
dollar was deliberately weakened by Morgan agents within the Federal Reserve
System in order to prop up the sagging British economy.
Let us return now to
the point of departure and allow our cast to resume playing out that most
important prior scene: the actual creation of the Federal Reserve System
itself.
HALF-WAY HOUSE TO CENTRAL BANKING
Historians seeking to justify governmental control of the monetary system
have claimed that the booms and busts that occurred during this period were
the result of free and competitive banking.
As we have seen, however, these
destructive cycles were the direct result of the creation and then
extinguishing of fiat money through a system of federally chartered national
banks - dominated by a handful of firms on Wall Street - which constituted a
half-way house to central banking. None of these banks were truly free of
state control nor were they competitive in the traditional sense of the word.
They were in fact subsidized by the government and had many monopolistic
privileges. From the perspective of bankers on Wall Street, however, there
was a great deal more to be desired. For one thing, America still did not
have a "lender of last resort."
That is banker language for a full-blown
central bank with the power to create unlimited amounts of fiat money which
can be rushed to the aid of any individual bank that is under siege by its
depositors wanting their money back. Having a lender of last resort is the
only way a bank can create money out of nothing and still be protected from
a potential "run" by its customers.
In other words, it is the means by which
the public is forced to pay a hidden tax of inflation to cover the shortfall
of fractional-reserve banking.
That is why the so-called virtue of a lender
of last resort is taught with great reverence today in virtually all
academic institutions offering degrees in banking and finance. It is one of
the means by which the system perpetuates itself.
The banks could now inflate more radically and more in unison than before
the war but, when they pushed too far and too fast, their bank-generated
booms still collapsed into recessions. While this could be highly profitable
to the banks, it was also precarious. As the American economy expanded in
size, the magnitude of the booms and busts increased also, and it was
becoming more and more difficult for firms like Morgan & Company to safely
ride out the storm.
There was a growing dread that the next collapse might
be more than even they could handle.
1. See Kolko, Triumph, p. 140.
In addition to these concerns was the fact that many state banks, mostly in
the developing Southern and Western states, had elected not to join the
national banking system and, consequently, had escaped control by the Wall-Street-Washington
axis.
As the population expanded south and westward, much of the nation's
banking moved likewise, and the new banks were becoming an increasing source
of competition to the New York power center. By 1896, the number of
non-national banks had grown to sixty-one per cent, and they already held
fifty-four per cent of the country's total banking deposits.
By 1913, the
year in which the Federal Reserve Act was passed, those numbers had swelled
to seventy-one per cent non-national banks holding fifty-seven per cent of
the nation's deposits. Something had to be done to stop this movement.
Additional competition was developing from the trend in industry to finance
itself from profits rather than borrowed capital. Between 1900 and 1910,
seventy per cent of American corporate growth was funded internally, making
industry increasingly independent of the banks. What the bankers wanted -
and what many businessmen wanted also - was a more "flexible" or "elastic"
money supply which would allow them to create enough of it at any point in
time so as to be able to drive interest rates downward at will.
That would
make loans to businessmen so attractive they would have little choice but to
return to the bankers' stable.
TRUSTS AND CARTELS REPLACE COMPETITION
One more problem facing Wall Street was the fact that the biggest
investment houses, such as Morgan & Company and Kuhn, Loeb & Company,
although they remained as competitors, were by this time so large they had
ceased doing serious battle against each other.
The concept of trusts and
cartels had dawned in America laid, to those who already had made it to the
top, joint ventures, market sharing, price fixing, and mergers were far more
profitable than free-enterprise competition.
Ron Chernow explains:
Wall Street was snowballing into one big, Morgan-dominated institution. In
December 1909, Pierpont had bought a majority stake in the Equitable Life
Assurance Society from Thomas Fortune Ryan.
This gave him strong influence
over America's three biggest insurance companies - Mutual Life, Equitable,
and New York Life... His Bankers Trust had taken over three other banks. In
1909, he had gained control of Guaranty Trust, which through a series of
mergers he converted into America's largest trust... The core Money Trust
group included J.P. Morgan and Company, First National Bank, and
National City Bank...
Wall Street bankers incestuously swapped seats on each others boards. Some
banks had so many overlapping directors it was hard to separate them... The
banks also shared large equity stakes in each | other...
Why didn't banks just merge instead of carrying out the charade of swapping
shares and board members?
Most were private partnerships or closely held
banks and could have done so. The answer harked back to traditional American
antipathy against concentrated financial power. The Morgan-First
National-National City trio feared public retribution if it openly declared
its allegiance.
Interlocking directorates and other forms of hidden control were far more
safe than open consolidation but they, too, had their limitations. For one
thing, they could not penetrate the barriers of similar competitive
groupings. As these combines became larger and larger, ways were sought to
bring them together at the top rather than to capture the corporate entities
which comprised them.
Thus was born the concept of a cartel, a "community of
interest" among businessmen in the same field, a mechanism for coming
together as partners at a high level and to reduce or eliminate altogether
the harsh necessity of competition.
All cartels, however, have an internal self-destruct mechanism. Sooner or
later, one of the members inevitably becomes dissatisfied with his
agreed-upon piece of the pie. He decides to compete once again and seeks a
greater share of the market. It was quickly recognized that the only way to
prevent this from happening was to use the police power of government to
enforce the cartel agreement.
The procedure called for the passage of laws
disguised as measures to protect the consumer but which actually worked to
ensure the elimination of competition.
Henry P. Davison, who was a Morgan
partner, put it bluntly when he told a Congressional committee in 1912:
"I
would rather have regulation and control than free competition."
John D.
Rockefeller was even more to the point in one of his often repeated
comments:
"Competition is a sin."
This trend was not unique to the banking industry.
Ron Paul and Lewis Lehrman provide the historical perspective:
After 1896 and 1900, then, America entered a progressive and predominantly
Republican era.
Compulsory cartelization in the name of "progressivism"
began to invade every aspect of American economic life. The railroads had
begun the parade with the formation of the ICC in the 1880s, but now field
after field was being centralized and cartelized in the name of
"efficiency," "stability," "progress," and the general welfare...
In
particular, various big business groups, led by the J.P. Morgan interests,
often gathered in the National Civic Federation and other think tanks and
pressure organizations, saw that the voluntary cartels and the industrial
merger movements of the late
1890s had failed to achieve monopoly prices in industry.
Therefore, they
decided to turn to governments, state and federal, to curb the winds of
competition and to establish forms of compulsory cartels, in the name, of
course, of "curbing big business monopoly" and advancing the general
welfare.
The challenge no longer was how to overcome one's adversaries, but how to
keep new ones from entering the field.
When John D. used his enormous
profits from Standard Oil to take control of the Chase National Bank, and
his brother, William, bought the National City Bank of New York, Wall Street
had yet one more gladiator in the financial arena.
Morgan found that he had
no choice except to allow the Rockefellers into the club but, now that they
were in, they all agreed that the influx of competitors had to be stopped.
And that was to be the hidden purpose of federal legislation and government
control.
Gabriel Kolko explains:
The sheer magnitude of many of the mergers, culminating in U.S. Steel, soon
forced him [Morgan] to modify his stand, though at times he would have
preferred total control. More important, by 1898 he could not ignore the
massive power of new financial competitors and had to treat them with
deference.
Standard Oil Company, utilizing National City Bank for its
investments, had fixed resources substantially larger than Morgan's, and by
1899 was ready to move into the general economy... The test came, of
course, in the Northern Securities battle, which was essentially an
expensive draw. Morgan and Standard paid deference to each other thereafter,
and mutual toleration among bankers increased sharply...
A benign armed
neutrality, rather than positive affection, is as much a reason as any for
the high number of interlocks among the fwe major New York banking houses.
Writing in the year 1919, from the perspective of an inside view
of Wall
Street at that time, John Moody completes the picture:
This remarkable welding together of great corporate interests could not, of
course, have been accomplished if the "masters of capital" in Wall Street
had not themselves during the same period become more closely allied. The
rivalry of interests which was so characteristic during the reorganization
period a few years before had very largely disappeared.
Although the two
great groups of financiers, represented on the one hand by Morgan and his
allies and on the other by the Standard Oil forces, were still
distinguishable, they were now
working in practical harmony on the basis of a sort of mutual "community of
interest" of their own. Thus the control of capital and credit through
banking resources tended to become concentrated in the hands of fewer and
fewer men...
Before long it could be said, indeed, that two rival banking
groups no longer existed, but that one vast and harmonious banking power had
taken their place.
1. Paul and Lehrman, p. 119. [ Kolko, Triumph, pp. 143-44.
THE ALDRICH-VREELAND ACT
The monetary contractions of 1879 and 1893 were handled by Wall Street
fairly easily and without government intervention, but the crisis of 1907
pushed their resources close to the abyss.
It became clear that two changes
had to be made: all remnants of banking competition now had to be totally
eliminated and replaced by a national cartel; and far greater sums of fiat
money had to be made available to the banks to protect them from future runs
by depositors.
There was now no question that Congress would have to be
brought in as a partner in order to use the power of government to
accomplish these objectives.
Kolko continues:
The crisis of 1907, on the other hand, found the combined banking structure
of New York inadequate to meet the challenge, and chastened any obstreperous
financial powers who thought they might build their fortunes independently
of the entire banking community...
The nation had grown too large, banking
had become too complex. Wall Street, humbled and almost alone, turned from
its own resources to the national government.
1. Moody, pp. 117-18,150
The first step in this direction was openly a stop-gap measure.
In 1908,
Congress passed the Aldrich-Vreeland Act which, basically, accomplished two
objectives. First, it authorized the national banks to issue an emergency
currency, called script, to substitute for regular money when they found
themselves unable to pay their depositors. Script had been used by the bank
clearing houses during the panic of 1907 with partial success, but it had
been a bold experiment with no legal foundation.
Now Congress made it quite
legal and, as Galbraith observed,
"The new legislation regularized these
arrangements. This could be done against the security of sundry bonds and
commercial loans - these could, in effect, be turned into cash without being
sold."
The second and perhaps most important feature of the Act was to create a
National Monetary Commission to study the problems of American banking and
then make recommendations to Congress on how to stabilize the monetary
system.
The commission consisted of nine senators and nine representatives.
The Vice-chairman was Representative Edward Vreeland, a banker from the
Buffalo area. The chairman, of course, was Senator Nelson Aldrich. From the
start, it was obvious that the Commission was a sham. Aldrich conducted
virtually a one-man show.
The so-called fact-finding body held no official
meetings for almost two years while Aldrich toured Europe consulting with
the top central bankers of ;England, France, and Germany. Three-hundred
thousand tax dollars were spent on these junkets, and the only tangible
product of the Commission's work was thirty-eight massive volumes of the
history of European banking.
None of the members of the Commission were ever
consulted regarding the official recommendations issued by Aldrich in their
name. Actually, these were the work of Aldrich and six men who were not even
members of the Commission, and their report was drafted, not in a bare
Congressional conference room in Washington, but in a plush private
hunting resort in Georgia.
And this event finally brings us back to that cold, blustery night at the
New Jersey railway station where seven men, representing one-fourth of the
wealth of the world, boarded the Aldrich private car for a clandestine
journey to Jekyll Island.
THE JEKYLL ISLAND PLAN
As summarized in the opening chapter of this book, the purpose of that
meeting was to work out a plan to achieve five primary objectives:
-
How to stop the growing influence of small, rival banks and to
insure that control over the nation's financial resources would
remain in the hands of those present
-
How to make the money supply more elastic in order to reverse
the trend of private capital formation and to recapture the
industrial loan market
-
How to pool the meager reserves of all
the nation's banks into one large reserve so that at least a few of
them could protect themselves from currency drains and bank runs
-
How to shift the inevitable losses from the owners of the banks to
the taxpayers
-
How to convince Congress that the scheme was a measure to
protect the public
It was decided that the first two objectives could be achieved simply by
drafting the proper technical language into a cartel agreement and then
re-working the vocabulary into legislative phraseology.
The third and fourth
could be achieved by including in that legislation the establishment of a
lender of last resort; in other words, a true central bank with the ability
to create unlimited amounts of fiat money.
These were mostly technical
matters and, although there was some disagreement on a few minor points,
generally they were content to follow the advice of Paul Warburg, the man
who had the most experience in these matters and who was regarded as the
group's theoretician. The fifth objective was the critical one, and there
was much discussion on how to achieve it.
To convince Congress and the public that the establishment of a banking
cartel was, somehow, a measure to protect the public, the Jekyll Island
strategists laid down the following plan of action:
-
Do not call it a cartel nor even a central bank.
-
Make it look like a government agency.
-
Establish regional branches to create the appearance of
decentralization, not dominated by Wall Street banks.
-
Begin with a conservative structure including many sound
banking principles knowing that the provisions can be quietly altered or
removed in subsequent years.
-
Use the anger caused by recent panics and bank failures to create
popular demand for monetary reform.
-
Offer the Jekyll Island plan as though it were in response to that
need.
-
Employ university professors to give the plan the appearance of
academic approval.
-
Speak out against the plan to convince the public that Wall Street
bankers do not want it.
A CENTRAL BANK BY ANY OTHER NAME
Americans would never have accepted the Federal Reserve System if they had
known that it was half cartel and half central bank.
Even though the concept
of government protectionism was rapidly gaining acceptance in business,
academic, and political circles, the idea of cartels, trusts, and restraint
of free competition was still quite alien to the average voter. And within
the halls of Congress, any forthright proposal for either a cartel or a
central bank would have been soundly defeated.
Congressman Everis Hayes of
California warned:
"Our people have set their faces like steel against a
central bank."
Senator John Shafroth of Colorado declared:
"The Democratic
Party is opposed to a central bank."
The monetary scientists on Jekyll
Island decided, therefore, to devise a name for their new creature which
would avoid the word bank altogether and which would conjure the image of
the federal government itself.
And to create the deception that there would
be no concentration of power in the large New York banks, the original plan
calling for a central bank was replaced by a proposal for a network of
regional institutions which supposedly would share and diffuse that power.
Nathaniel Wright Stephenson, Senator Aldrich's biographer, tells us:
"Aldrich entered the discussion at Jekyll Island an ardent convert to the
idea of a central bank. His desire was to transplant the system of one of
the great European banks, say the Bank of England, bodily to America."
Galbraith explains further:
"It was his [Senator Aldrich's] thought to
outflank the opposition by having not one central bank but many. And the
word bank would itself be avoided."
Frank Vanderlip tells us the regional concept was merely window dressing and
that the network was always intended to operate as one central bank.
He
said:
"The law as enacted provided for twelve banks instead of one... but
the intent of the law was to coordinate the twelve through the Federal
Reserve Board in Washington, so that in effect they would operate as a
central bank."
If not using the word bank was essential to the Jekyll Island plan, avoiding
the word cartel was even more so. Yet, the cartel nature of the proposed
central bank was obvious to any astute observer. In an address before the
American Bankers Association,
Aldrich laid it out plainly.
He said:
"The organization proposed is not a
bank, but a cooperative union of all the banks of the country for definite
purposes."
Two years later, in a speech before that same group of bankers,
A. Barton Hepburn of Chase National Bank was even more candid.
He said:
"The
measure recognizes and adopts the principles of a central bank. Indeed, if
it works out as the sponsors of the law hope, it will make all incorporated
banks together joint owners of a central dominating power."
It would be
difficult to find a better definition of the word cartel than that.
The plan to structure the Creature conservatively at the start and then to
remove the safeguards later was the brainchild of Paul Warburg. The creation
of a powerful Federal Reserve Board was also his idea as a means by which
the regional branches could be absorbed into a central bank with control
safely in New York.
Professor Edwin Seligman, a member of the
international banking family of J&W Seligman, and head of the Department of
Economics at Columbia University, explains and praises the plan:
It was in my study that Mr. Warburg first conceived the idea of presenting
his views to the public... In its fundamental features the Federal Reserve
Act is the work of Mr. Warburg more than any other man in the country... The existence of a Federal Reserve Board creates, in everything but in name,
a real central bank...
Mr. Warburg had a practical object in view... It
was incumbent on him to remember that the education of the country must be
gradual and that a large part of the task was to break down prejudices and
remove suspicion.
His plans therefore contain all sorts of elaborate
suggestions designed to guard the public against fancied dangers and to
persuade the country that the general scheme was at all practicable.
It was
the hope of Mr. Warburg that with the lapse of time it may be possible to
eliminate from the law not a few clauses which were inserted largely, at his
suggestion, for educational purposes.
THE ALDRICH BILL
The first draft of the Jekyll Island plan was submitted to the Senate by
Nelson Aldrich but, due to the Senator's unexpected illness when he returned
to Washington, it was actually written by Frank Vanderlip and Benjamin
Strong.
Although it was co-authored by Congressman Vreeland, it immediately
became known as the Aldrich Bill. Vreeland, by his own admission, had little
to do with it either, but his willingness to be a team player in the game of
national deception was of great value.
Writing in the August 25, 1910, issue
of The Independent, which incidentally was owned by Aldrich himself and was
anything but independent, Vreeland said:
"The bank I propose... is an ideal
method of fighting monopoly. It could not possibly itself become a
monopoly and it would prevent other banks combining into monopolies.
With earnings limited to four and one-half per cent, there could not be
a monopoly."
What an amazing statement. It is brilliantly insidious because of the half
truths it contains. It is true that monopolies cannot - or at least do not -
operate at four and one-half per cent interest.
But it is untrue that the
Federal Reserve banks were to be held to that lowly rate. It is true that
four per cent was the stated amount they would earn on the stock purchased
in the System, but it is also true that the real profits were to be made,
not from stock dividends, but from the harvesting of interest payments on
fiat money.
To this was to be added the profits made possible from operating
on smaller safety margins yet still being protected from bankruptcy.
Furthermore, being on the inside of the nation's central bank would make
them privy to the important money-making data and decisions long before
their competitors.
The profits that could be derived from such an advantage
would be equal to or even greater than those from the Mandrake Mechanism. It
is true that the Federal Reserve was to be a private institution, but it is
certainly not true that this was to mark the disappearance of the government
from the banking business. In fact, it was just the opposite, because it
marked the appearance of the government as a partner with private bankers
and as the enforcer of their cartel agreement.
Government would now become
more deeply involved than ever before in our history.
Half truths and propaganda notwithstanding, the organizational structure
proposed by the Aldrich Bill was similar in many ways to the old Bank of the
United States. It was to have the right to convert federal debt into money,
to loan that money to the government, to control the affairs of regional
banks, and to be the depository of government funds.
The dissimilarities
were in those provisions which gave the Creature more privilege and power
than the older central bank. The most important of these was the right to
create the official money of the United States. For the first time in our
history, the paper notes of a banking institution became legal tender, not
only for public debts, but for private ones as well.
Henceforth, anyone
refusing to accept these notes would be sent to prison. The words "The
United States of America" were to appear on the face of every note along
with the great seal of the United States Treasury. And, of course, the
signature of the Treasurer himself would be printed in a conspicuous
location.
All of this was designed to convince the public that the new
institution was surely an agency of the government itself.
TURNING THE OPPOSITION AGAINST ITSELF
Now that the basic strategy was in place and a specific bill had been
drafted, the next step was to create popular support for it.
This was the
critical part of the plan and it required the utmost finesse. The task
actually was made easier by the fact that there was a great deal of genuine
opposition to the concentration of financial power on Wall Street. Two of
the most outspoken critics at that time were Wisconsin Senator Robert LaFollette and Minnesota Congressman Charles Lindbergh.
Hardly a week passed
without one of them delivering a scathing speech against what they called
"the money trust" which was responsible, they said, for deliberately
creating economic booms and busts in order to reap the profits of salvaging
foreclosed homes, farms and businesses.
If anyone doubted that such a trust
really existed, their skepticism was abruptly terminated when LaFollette
publicly charged that the entire country was controlled by just fifty men.
The monetary scientists were not dismayed nor did they even bother to deny
it.
In fact, when George F. Baker, who was a partner of J.P. Morgan, was
asked by reporters for his reaction to LaFollette's claim, he replied that
it was totally absurd. He knew from personal knowledge, he said, that the
number was not more than eight!
The public was, of course, outraged, and the pressure predictably mounted
for Congress to do something. The monetary scientists were fully prepared to
turn this reaction to their own advantage.
The strategy was simple:
-
set
up a special Congressional committee to investigate the money trust
-
make sure the committee is staffed by friends of the trust itself
-
conceal the full scope of the trust's operation while revealing just enough
to intensify the public clamor for reform
Once the political climate was
hot enough, then the Aldrich Bill could be put forward, supposedly as the
answer to that need.
This strategy was certainly not new. As Congressman Lindbergh explained:
Ever since the Civil War, Congress has allowed the bankers to completely
control financial legislation. The membership of the Finance Committee in
the Senate and the Committee on Banking and Currency in the House, has been
made up of bankers, their agents and attorneys.
These committees have
controlled the nature of the bills to be reported, the extent of them, and
the debates that were to be held on them when they were being considered in
the Senate and the House.
No one, not on the committee, is recognized...
unless someone favorable to the committee has been arranged for.
THE PUJO COMMITTEE
The Pujo Committee was a perfect example of this kind of chicanery.
It was a
subcommittee of the House Committee on Banking and Currency and it was given
the awesome responsibility of conducting the famous "Money Trust"
investigation of 1912.
Its chairman was Arsene Pujo of Louisiana who, true
to form, was regarded by many as a spokesman for the "Oil Trust" The
hearings dragged on for eight months producing volumes of dry statistics and
self-serving testimony of the great Wall Street bankers themselves. At no
time were the financiers asked any questions about their affairs with foreign
investment houses. Nor were they asked about their response to competition
from new banks.
There were no questions about their plan to protect the
speculative banks from currency drains; or their motive for wanting
artificially low interest rates; or their formula for passing on their
losses to the taxpayer. The public was given the impression that Congress
was really prying off the lid of scandal and corruption, but the reality was
more like a fireside chat between old friends.
No matter what vagaries or
absurdities fell from the bankers' lips, it was accepted
without contest.
These hearings were conducted largely as a result of the public accusations
made by Congressmen Lindbergh and Senator LaFollette. Yet, when they
requested to appear before the Committee, both of them were denied access.
The only witnesses to testify were the bankers themselves and their friends.
Kolko tells us:
Fortunately for the reformers, the Pujo Committee swung into high gear in
its investigation of the Money Trust during the summer of 1912, and for
eight months frightened the nation with its awesome, if inconclusive,
statistics on the power of Wall Street over the nation's economy...
Five banking firms, the elaborate tables of
the committee showed, held 341 directorships in 112 corporations with an
aggregate capitalization of over $22 billion. The evidence seemed
conclusive, and the nation was suitably frightened into realizing that
reform of the banking system was urgent - presumably to bring Wall
Street under control...
The orgy of Wall Street was resurrected by the newspapers, who quite ignored
the fact that the biggest advocates of banking reform were the bankers
themselves, bankers with a somewhat different view of the problem... Yet it
was largely the Pujo hearings that made the topic of banking reform a
serious one.
Kolko has touched upon an interesting point.
Almost no one put any
significance to the fact that some of the biggest bankers on Wall Street
were the first marchers to lead the parade for banking reform. The most
conspicuous among these was Paul Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb & Company who, for
seven years prior to passage of the Federal Reserve Act, travelled around
the country doing nothing but giving "reform" speeches and writing scholarly
articles for the media, including an eleven-part series for The New York
Times.
Spokesmen from the houses of Morgan and Rockefeller joined in and
made regular appearances before professional and political bodies echoing
the call for reform.
Yet no one paid any attention to the unmistakable odor
of fish.
ENLISTING THE HELP OF ACADEMIA
The speeches and articles by big-name bankers were never Intended to sway
the public at large.
They served the function of putting forth the basic
arguments and the technical details which I were to be the starting point
for the work of others who could not be accused of having self-serving
motives. To carry the message to the voters, it was decided that
representatives from the world of academia should be enlisted to provide
the necessary aura of respectability and intellectual objectivity.
For that
purpose, the banks contributed a sum of $5 million to a special
"educational" fund, and much of that money found its way into the environs
of three universities:
Princeton, Harvard, and the University of Chicago,
all of which had been recipients of large endowments from the captains of
industry and finance.
It was precisely at this time that the study of "economics" was becoming a
new and acceptable field, and it was not difficult to find talented but
slightly hungry professors who, in return for a grant or la prestigious
appointment, were eager to expound the virtues of lie Jekyll Island plan.
Not only was such academic pursuit financially rewarding, it also provided
national recognition for them as pioneers in the new field of economics.
Galbraith says:
Under Aldrich's direction a score or more of studies of monetary
institutions in the United States and, more particularly, in other countries
were commissioned from the emergent economics profession.
It is at least
possible that the reverence in which the Federal Reserve System has since
been held by economists owes something to the circumstance that so many who
pioneered in the profession participated also in its [the System's] birth.
The principal accomplishment of the bank's educational fund
was to create
an organization called the National Citizens' League.
Although it was
entirely financed and controlled by the banks tinder the personal guidance
of Paul Warburg, it presented itself merely as a group of concerned
citizens seeking banking reform.
1. Galbraith, p. 121.
The function of the organization was to
disseminate hundreds of
thousands of "educational" pamphlets, to organize letter-writing campaigns
to Congressmen, to supply quotable material to the news media, and in other
ways to create the illusion of grass-roots support for the Jekyll Island
plan.
Nathaniel Stephenson, in his biography of Nelson Aldrich, says:
"The league
was non-partisan. It was careful to abstain from emphasizing Senator
Aldrich... First and last, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent by
the league in popularizing financial science."
The man chosen to head up that effort was an economics professor by the name
of J. Laurence Laughlin.
Kolko says that,
"Laughlin, nominally very orthodox
in his commitment to laissez faire theory, was nevertheless a leading
academic advocate of banking regulation... and was sensitive to the needs
of banking as well as the realities of politics."
Did his appointment bring
intellectual objectivity to the new organization?
Stephenson answers:
"Professor Laughlin of the University of Chicago was given charge of the
League's propaganda."
To which Congressman Lindbergh adds this reminder:
"The reader knows that the University of Chicago is an institution endowed
by John D. Rockefeller with nearly fifty million dollars. It may truly be
said to be the Rockefeller University."
1. Stephenson, pp. 38&-89.
2. Kolko, Triumph, p. 187.
This does not necessarily mean that Laughlin was purchased like so many
pounds of hamburger and told by Rockefeller what to say and do.
It doesn't
work that way. The professor undoubtedly believed in the virtue of the
Jekyll Island plan, and the evidence is that he pursued his assignment with
enthusiastic sincerity. But there is no doubt that he was selected for his
new post precisely because he did support the concept of a partnership
between banking and government as a healthy substitute for "destructive"
competition.
In other words, if he didn't honestly agree with John D. that
competition was a sin, he probably never even would have been given a
professorship in the first place.
WILSON AND WALL STREET
Woodrow Wilson was yet another academic who was brought into the national
spotlight as a result of his views on banking reform.
It will be recalled
from a previous chapter that Wilson's name had been put into nomination for
President at the Democratic national convention largely due to the influence
of Col. Edward Mandell House. But that was 1912.
Ten years prior to that, he
was relatively unknown. In 1902 he had been elected as the president of
Princeton University, a position he could not have held without the
concurrence of the University's benefactors among Wall Street bankers. He
was particularly close with Andrew Carnegie and had become a trustee of the
Carnegie Foundation.
Two of the most generous donors were Cleveland H. Dodge and Cyrus McCormick,
directors of Rockefeller's National City Bank. They were part of that Wall
Street elite which the Pujo Committee had described as America's "Money
Trust."
Both men had been Wilson's classmates at Princeton University. When
Wilson returned to Princeton as a professor in 1890, Dodge and McCormick
were, by reason of their wealth, University trustees, and they took it upon
themselves to personally advance his career.
Ferdinand Lundberg, in
America's Sixty Families, says this:
For nearly twenty years before his nomination Woodrow Wilson had moved in
the shadow of Wall Street...
In 1898 Wilson, his salary unsatisfactory,
besieged with offers of many university presidencies, threatened to resign.
Dodge and McCormick thereupon constituted themselves his financial
guardians, and agreed to raise the additional informal stipendium that kept
him at Princeton.
The contributors to this private fund were Dodge,
McCormick, and Moses Taylor Pyne and Percy R. Pyne, of the family that
founded the National City Bank. In 1902 this same group arranged Wilson's
election as president of the university.
A grateful Wilson often had spoken in glowing terms about the rise of vast
corporations and had praised J.P. Morgan as a great American leader. He also
had come to acceptable conclusions about the value of a controlled economy.
"The old time of individual competition is probably gone by," he said. "It
may come back; I don't know; it will not come back within our time, I dare
say."
H.S. Kenan tells us the rest of the story:
Woodrow Wilson, President of Princeton University, was the first prominent
educator to speak in favor of the Aldrich Plan, a gesture which immediately
brought him the Governorship of New Jersey and later the Presidency of the
United States.
During the panic of 1907, Wilson declared that:
"all this
trouble could be averted if we appointed a committee of six or seven
public-spirited men like J.P. Morgan to handle the affairs of our country."
1
OPPOSITION TO THE ALDRICH BILL
One of the disagreements at the Jekyll Island meeting was over the name to
be attached to the proposed legislation.
Warburg, being the master
psychologist he was, wanted it to be called the National Reserve Bill or the
Federal Reserve Bill, something which would conjure up the dual images of
government and reserves, both of which were calculated to be subconsciously
appealing. Aldrich, on the other hand, acting out of personal ego, insisted
that his name be attached to the bill.
Warburg pointed out that the Aldrich
name was associated in the minds of the public with Wall Street interests,
and that would be an unnecessary obstacle to achieving their goal. Aldrich
said that, since he had been the chairman of the National Monetary
Commission which was created specifically to make recommendations for
banking reform, people would be confused if his name were not associated
with the bill.
The debate, we are told, was long and heated. But, in the
end, the politician's ego won out over the banker's logic.
Warburg, of course, was right. Aldrich was well known as a Republican
spokesman for big business and banking. His loyalties were further
publicized by recently sponsored tariff bills to protect the tobacco and
rubber trusts. The Aldrich name on a bill for banking reform was an easy
target for the opposition.
On December 15, 1911, Congressman Lindbergh rose
before the House of Representatives and took careful aim:
The Aldrich Plan is the Wall Street Plan. It is a broad challenge to the
government by the champion of the money trust. It means another panic, if
necessary, to intimidate the people. Aldrich, paid by the government to
represent the people, proposes a plan for the trusts instead.2
1. H.S. Kenan The Federal Reserve Bank (Los Angeles: Noontide Press, 1966),p.
105
2. Quoted by H.S. Kenan, p. 118.
The Aldrich Bill never came to a vote. When the Republicans lost control of
the House in 1910 and then lost the Senate and the Presidency in 1912, any
hope there may have been of putting through a Republican bill was lost.
Aldrich had been voted out of the Senate by his constituents, and the ball
was now squarely in the court of the Democrats and their new president,
Woodrow Wilson.
How this came to pass is an interesting lesson on reality politics, and we
shall turn to that part of the story next.
SUMMARY
Banking in the period immediately prior to passage of the Federal Reserve
Act was subject to a myriad of controls, regulations, subsidies, and
privileges at both the federal and state levels, popular history portrays
this period as one of unbridled competition and free banking.
It was, in
fact, a half-way house to central banking. Wall Street, however, wanted more
government participation. The New York bankers particularly wanted a "lender
of last resort" to create unlimited amounts of fiat money for their use in
the event they were exposed to bank runs or currency drains. They also
wanted to force all banks to follow the same inadequate reserve policies so
that more cautious ones would not draw down the reserves of the others.
An
additional objective was to limit the growth of new banks in the South and
West.
This was a time of growing enchantment with the idea of trusts and cartels.
For those who had already made it to the top, competition was considered
chaotic and wasteful. Wall Street was Snowballing into two major banking
groups: the Morgans and the Rockefellers, and even they had largely ceased
competing with each other in favor of cooperative financial structures.
But
to keep these cartel combines from flying apart, a means of discipline was
heeded to force the participants to abide by the agreements. The federal
government was brought in as a partner to serve that function.
To sell the plan to Congress, the cartel reality had to be hidden and the
name "central bank" had to be avoided.
-
the word Federal was chosen to make
it sound like it was a government operation
-
the word Reserve was chosen to make it
appear financially sound
-
the word System (the first drafts used
the word Association) was chosen to conceal the fact that it was a central
bank
A structure of 12 regional institutions was conceived as a further
ploy to create
the illusion of decentralization, but the mechanism was designed from the
beginning to operate as a central bank closely modeled after the Bank of
England.
The first draft of the Federal Reserve Act was called the Aldrich Bill and
was co-sponsored by Congressman Vreeland, but it was not the work of either
of these politicians. It was the brainchild of banker Paul Warburg and was
actually written by bankers Frank Vanderlip and Benjamin Strong.
Aldrich's name attached to a banking bill was bad strategy, because he was
known as a Wall Street Senator. His bill was not politically acceptable and
was never released from committee.
The groundwork had been done, however,
and the time had arrived to change labels and political parties.
The measure
would now undergo minor cosmetic surgery and reappear under the sponsorship
of a politician whose name would be associated in the public mind with
anti-Wall Street sentiments.
Chapter Twenty-Two
THE CREATURE
SWALLOWS
CONGRESS
The second attempt to pass legislation to legalize the banking cartel; the
bankers' selection of Woodrow Wilson as a Presidential candidate; their
strategy to get him elected; the role played by Wilson to promote the
cartels legislation; the final passage of the Federal Reserve Act.
The election of 1912 was a textbook example of power politics
and voter
deception.
The Republican President, William Howard Taft, was up for
reelection. Like most Republicans of that era, his political power was based
upon the support of big-business and banking interests in the industrial
regions.
He had been elected to his first term in the expectation that he
would continue the protectionist policies of his predecessor, Teddy
Roosevelt, particularly in the expansion of cartel markets for sugar,
coffee, and fruit [from Latin America. Once in office, however, he grew more
restrained in these measures and earned the animosity of many powerful
Republicans.
The ultimate breach occurred when Taft refused to support the
Aldrich Plan. He objected, not because it [would create a central bank which
would impose government control over the economy, but because it would not
offer enough government control. He recognized that the Jekyll Island
formula Would place the bankers into the driver's seat with only nominal participation by the government.
He did not object to the ancient
Partnership between monetary and political scientists, he merely wanted a
greater share for the political side. The bankers were not adverse to
negotiating the balance of power nor were they unwilling to make
compromises, but what they really needed at this juncture was a man in the
White House who, instead of being lukewarm on the plan, could be counted on
to become its champion and who would use his influence as President to
garner support from the fence straddlers in Congress.
From that moment
forward, Taft was marked for political extinction.
This was a period of general prosperity, and Taft was popular with the
voters as well as with the rank-and-file Party organization He had easily
won the nomination at the Republican convention, and there was little doubt
that he could take the presidential election as well.
Wilson had been put
forth as the Democratic challenger, but his dry personality and aloof
mannerisms had failed to arouse sufficient voter interest to make him a
serious contender.
THE BULL MOOSE CANDIDATE
However, when Teddy Roosevelt returned from his latest African safari, he
was persuaded by Morgan's deputies, George Perkins and Frank Munsey, to
challenge the President for the Party's nomination.
When that effort failed,
he was then persuaded to run against Taft as the "Bull Moose" candidate on
the Progressive Party ticket. It is unclear what motivated him to accept
such a proposition, but there is no doubt regarding the intent of his
backers. They did not expect Roosevelt to win, but, as a former Republican
President, they knew he would split the Party and, by pulling away votes
from Taft, put Wilson into the White House.
Presidential campaigns need money and lots of it.
The Republican Party was
well financed, largely from the same individuals who now wanted to see the
defeat of its own candidate. It would not be possible to cut off this
funding without causing too many questions. The solution, therefore, was to
provide the financial resources for all three candidates, with special
attention to the needs of Wilson and Roosevelt.
Some historians, while admitting the facts, have scoffed at the conclusion
that deception was intended.
Ron Chernow says:
"By 1924, the House of Morgan
was so influential in American politics that conspiracy buffs couldn't tell
which presidential candidate was more beholden to the bank."
But one does
not have to be a conspiracy buff to recognize the evidence of foul play.
Ferdinand Lundberg tells us:
J.P. Morgan and Company played the leading role in the national election of
1912... Roosevelt's preconvention backers were George W. Perkins and Frank
Munsey. These two, indeed, encouraged Roosevelt to contest Tart's
nomination...
Munsey functioned in the newspaper field for J.P. Morgan and
Company - buying, selling, creating, and suppressing newspapers in
consonance with J.P. Morgan's shifting needs... Perkins resigned from J.P.
Morgan and Company on January 1,1911, to assume a larger political role...
The suspicion seems justified that the two
were not over-anxious to have Roosevelt win. The notion that Perkins and
Munsey may have wanted Wilson to win... is partly substantiated by the
view that Perkins put a good deal of cash behind the Wilson campaign
through Cleveland H. Dodge. Dodge and Perkins financed, to the extent of
$35,500, the Trenton True American, a newspaper that circulated
nationally with Wilson propaganda...
Throughout the three-cornered fight, Roosevelt had Munsey and George Perkins
constantly at his heels, supplying money, going over his speeches, bringing
people from Wall Street in to help, and, in general, carrying the entire
burden of the campaign against Taft... Perkins and J.P. Morgan and Company
were the substance of the Progressive Party; everything else was
trimming...
Munsey's cash contribution to the Progressive Party brought his
total political outlay for 1912 to $229,255.72.
Perkins made their joint
contribution more than $500,000, and Munsey expended $1,000,000 in cash
additionally to acquire from Henry Einstein the New York Press so that
Roosevelt would have a New York City morning newspaper. Perkins and Munsey,
as the Clapp [Senate Privileges and Election] Committee learned from
Roosevelt himself, also underwrote the heavy expense of Roosevelt's campaign
train.
In short, most of Roosevelt's campaign fund was supplied by the two
Morgan hatchet men who were seeking Taft's scalp.
Morgan & Company was not the only banking firm on Wall Street to endorse a
three-way election as a means of defeating Taft.
Within the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company, Felix
Warburg was Dutifully putting money into the Republican campaign as
expected, but his brother, Paul Warburg and Jacob
Schiff were backing Wilson, while yet another partner, Otto Kahn, supported
Roosevelt. Other prominent Republicans who contributed to the Democratic
campaign that year were Bernard Baruch, Henry Morgenthau, and Thomas Fortune
Ryan.2
1. Lundberg, pp. 106-12.
2. Kolko, Triumph, pp. 205-11.
And the Rockefeller
component of the cartel was just as deeply involved. William McAdoo, who was
Wilson's national campaign vice chairman, says that Cleveland Dodge of
Rockefeller's National City Bank personally contributed $51,300 - more than
one-fourth the total raised from all other sources.
In McAdoo's words,
"He
was a Godsend."
Ferdinand Lundberg describes Dodge as,
"the financial genius
behind Woodrow Wilson."
Continuing, he says:
Wilson's nomination represented a personal triumph for Cleveland H. Dodge,
director of the National City Bank, scion of the Dodge copper and munitions
fortune...
The nomination represented no less a triumph for Ryan, Harvey,
and J.P. Morgan and Company. Sitting with Dodge as co-directors of the
National City Bank at the time were the younger J.P. Morgan, now the head of
the [Morgan] firm, Jacob Schiff, William Rockefeller, J. Ogden Armour, and
James Stillman. In short, except for George F. Baker, everyone whom the Pujo
Committee had termed rulers of the "Money Trust" was in this bank.
And so it came to pass that the monetary scientists carefully selected their
candidate and set about to clear the way for his victory. The maneuver was
brilliant.
Who would suspect that Wall Street would support a Democrat,
especially when the Party platform contained this plank:
"We oppose the
so-called Aldrich Bill or the establishment of a central bank; and ... what
is known as the money trust."
What irony it was.
The Party of the working man, the Party of Thomas
Jefferson - formed only a few generations earlier for the specific purpose
of opposing a central bank - was now cheering a new leader who was a
political captive of Wall Street bankers and who had agreed to the hidden
agenda of establishing the Federal Reserve System.
As George Harvey later
boasted, the financiers,
"felt no animosity toward Mr. Wilson for such of his
utterances as they regarded as radical and menacing to their interests. He
had simply played the political game."
William McAdoo, Wilson's national campaign vice chairman, destined to become
Secretary of the Treasury, saw what was happening from a ringside seat He
said:
The major contributions to any candidate's campaign fund are made by men who
have axes to grind - and the campaign chest is the grindstone...
The fact
is that there is a serious danger of this country becoming a pluto-democracy;
that is, a sham republic with the real government in the hands of a small
clique of enormously wealthy men, who speak through their money, and whose
influence, even today, radiates to every corner of the United States.
Experience has shown that the most practicable method of getting hold of a
political party is to furnish it with money in large quantities. This brings
the big money-giver or givers into close communion with the party leaders.
Contact and influence do the rest.
THE MONEY TRUST THEY LOVE TO HATE
Roosevelt actually had very little interest in the banking issue, probably
because he didn't understand it Furthermore, in the unlikely event the
blustery "trust buster" would actually win the election, the financiers
still had little to fear.
In spite of his well-publicized stance of
opposing big business, his true convictions were quite acceptable to Wall
Street.
As Chernow observed:
Although the Roosevelt-Morgan relationship is sometimes caricatured as that
of trust buster versus trust king, it was far more complex than that. The
public wrangling obscured deeper ideological affinities... Roosevelt saw
trusts as natural, organic outgrowths of economic development. Stopping
them, he said, was like trying to dam the Mississippi River.
Both TR and
Morgan disliked the rugged, individualistic economy of the nineteenth
century and favored big business..., In the sparring between Roosevelt and
Morgan there was always a certain amount of shadow play, a pretense of
greater animosity than actually existed... Roosevelt and Morgan were secret
blood brothers.
It is not surprising, therefore, as Warburg noted in January, 1912 - ten
months before the election - that Teddy had been "fairly won over to a
favorable consideration of the Aldrich Plan."
Inner convictions on these issues notwithstanding, both Wilson and Roosevelt
played their roles to the hilt. Privately financed by Wall Street's most
powerful bankers, they publicly carried a flaming crusade against the "Money
Trust" from one end of the country to the other.
1.- McAdoo, pp. 165-66. K- Chernow, pp, 106-12. f. Warburg, Vol. I, p. 78.
Roosevelt bellowed that the,
"issue of currency
should be lodged with the government and be protected from domination and
manipulation by Wall Street."
And he quoted over and over again the Bull
Moose (Progressive Party) platform which said:
"We are opposed to the
so-called Aldrich Currency Bill because its provisions would place our
currency and credit system in private hands."
Meanwhile, at the other end of
town, Wilson declared:
There has come about an extraordinary and very sinister concentration in the
control of business in the country... The growth of our nation, therefore,
and all our activities, are in the hands of a few men... This money trust,
or as it should be more properly called, this credit trust... is no myth.
Throughout the campaign, Taft was portrayed as the champion of big business
and Wall Street banks - which, of course, he was.
But so were Roosevelt and
Wilson, The primary difference was that Taft, judged by his actual
performance in office, was known to be such, whereas his opponents could
only be judged by their words.
The outcome of the election was exactly as the strategists had anticipated.
Wilson won with only forty-two per cent of the popular vote, which means, of
course, that fifty-eight per cent had been cast against him Had Roosevelt
not entered the race, most of his votes undoubtedly would have gone to Taft,
and Wilson would have become a footnote.
As Colonel House confided to author
George Viereck years later,
"Wilson was elected by Teddy Roosevelt."
Now that the Creature had moved into the White House, passage of the Jekyll
Island plan went into its final phase.
The last bastion of opposition in
Congress consisted of the Populist wing of the Democratic Party under the
leadership of William Jennings Bryan. The problem with this group was that
they had taken their campaign platform seriously. They really were opposed
to the Money Trust.
While it may have been a simple matter to pull the wool
over the eyes of voters, it would not be so easy to fool this group of
experienced politicians.
What was needed now was an entirely new bill that, on the surface, would appear to contain changes of
sufficient magnitude to allow the Bryan wing to change its position. The
essential features of the plan, however, must not be Abandoned. And, to
coordinate this final strategy, the services of someone with great
political skill would be essential.
Fortunately for the planners, there was
exactly such a man residing at the White house. It was not the President of
the United States.
It was Edward Mandell House.
THE ROLE OF COLONEL HOUSE
Colonel House, who had been educated in England and whose lather represented
England's merchant interests in the American South, had come into public
life through the London Connection.
It will be recalled from previous
chapters that, perhaps more than any other person in America, he had helped
maneuver the United States into World War I on the side of a desperate
Britain and, by so doing, had also rescued the massive loans to Britain and
France made by the Morgan interests.
Not only had he been responsible tor
Wilson's nomination at the Democratic convention, but had become the
President's constant companion, his personal adviser, and in many respects
his political superior. It was through House that Wilson was made aware of
the wishes of the Money Trust, and It was House who guided the President in
every aspect of foreign and economic policy.
An admiring biographer, Arthur
Smith, writing in the year 1918, says that House,
"holds a power never
wielded before in this country by any man out of office, a power greater
than that of any political boss or Cabinet member."
A more recent
biographer, George Viereck, was not exaggerating when he described House as,
"Chief Magistracy of the Republic," "Super-Ambassador," "The pilot who
guided the ship."
Continuing, he said:
For six years two rooms were at his disposal in the North Wing of the White
House... In work and play their thoughts were one. House was the double of
Wilson. It was House who made the slate for the Cabinet, formulated the
first policies of the Administration and practically directed the foreign
affairs of the United States. We had, indeed, two Presidents for one!...
1. Arthur Smith, The Real Colonel House (New York: George H. Doran Company,
1918), p. 14.
P. Viereck, p. 4.
The Scruffs, the Warburgs, the Kahns, the Rockefellers, the Morgans put
their faith in House.
When the Federal Reserve legislation at last assumed
definite shape, House was the intermediary between the White House and the
financiers. Daily entries in the personal journal of Colonel House reveal
the extent to which his office had become the command post for the Jekyll
Island team.
The following sample notations are typical:
December 19, 1912.
I Talked with Paul Warburg over the
telephone regarding the currency reform. I told of my
Washington trip and what I had done there to get it in
working order.
March 24, 1913.
I had an engagement with Carter Glass at five. We drove, in
order not to be interrupted... I spoke to the President about this after
dinner and advised that McAdoo and I whip the Glass measure into final
shape, which he could endorse and take to Owen [Chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee] as his own.
March 27,1913.
Mr. J.P. Morgan, Jr., and Mr. Denny of his firm, came
promptly at five. McAdoo came about ten minutes afterwards. Morgan had a
currency plan already formulated and printed. We discussed it at some
length. I suggested he have it typewritten [so it would not seem too
prearranged] and sent to us today.
October 19r 1913.
I saw Senator Reed of Missouri in the late afternoon and
discussed the currency question with him.
October 19,1913.
Paul Warburg was my first caller, and he came to discuss
the currency measure... Senator Murray Crane followed Warburg. He has been
in touch with Senators Weeks and Nelson of the Currency Committee.
November 17, 1913.
Paul Warburg telephoned about his trip to Washington. He
is much disturbed over the currency situation and requested an interview,
along with Jacob Schiff and Cleveland H. Dodge.
January 21, 1914.
After dinner we [Wilson and House] went to the President's
study as usual and began work on the Federal Reserve Board appointments.
As far as the banking issue was concerned, Colonel House was the President
of the United States, and all interested parties knew it.
Wilson made no
pretense at knowledge of banking theory.
He said:
''The greatest
embarrassment of my political career has been that Active duties seem to
deprive me of time for careful investigation. I seem almost obliged to form
conclusions from impressions instead of from study... I wish that I had
more knowledge, more thorough acquaintance, with the matters involved."
To
which Charles Seymour adds:
"Colonel House was indefatigable in providing
for the President the knowledge that he sought... The Colonel was the unseen
guardian angel of the bill."
DEATH OF THE ALDRICH PLAN
The first task for the Jekyll Island team was to hold a funeral for the
Aldrich Plan without actually burying it.
Professor Laughlin had come to
agree with Warburg regarding the inadvisability of Slaving Aldrich's name
attached to any banking bill, especially now that the Democrats were in
control of both Congress and the White House, and he was anxious to give it
a new identity.
Writing in the periodical Banking Reform, which was the
official publication of the National Citizens' League, Laughlin said:
"It is
progress that the Aldrich plan came and went. It is progress that the people
have peen aroused and interested."
The League was now free, he said, to,
"try to help in getting a proper bill adopted by the Democrats," a bill
that "in non-essentials... could be made different from the old plan."
It did not take long for the Democrats to bring
forth their own ^proposal. In fact, that process had begun even before the
election of 1912.
One of the most outspoken critics of the Aldrich
plan was the Democratic Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, Congressman Carter Glass from
Virginia. And it was Glass who was given the responsibility of developing the
new plan.
By his own admission, however, he had virtually no technical
knowledge of banking. To provide that expertise and to actually write the
bill, he hired an economics teacher from Washington and Lee University,
Henry Parker Willis. We should not be surprised to learn that Willis had
been a former student and protégé of Professor Laughlin and had been
retained by the National Citizens' League as a technical writer.
Explaining
the significance of this relationship, Kolko says:
Throughout the spring of 1912 Willis wrote Laughlin about his work for the
Glass Committee, his relationship to his superior, and Washington gossip.
The advice of the old professor was much revered...
"When you arrive," he wrote Laughlin
concerning a memorandum he had written, "I should like to show it to
you for such criticisms as occur to you."
The student-teacher relationship between the
two men was still prominent...
Laughlin, Colonel House, and Glass were to frequently consult with major
bankers about reform, and provided an important and continuous bridge for
their ideas while bills were being drafted... Colonel House, in addition,
was talked to by Frick, Otto Kahn, and others in late February, and the
following month also met Vanderlip, J.P. Morgan, Jr., and other bankers to
discuss currency reform...
To make sure the reform was more to the liking
of bankers, a steady barrage of personal, unobtrusive communications with
Glass, House, and Wilson was kept up throughout February and March... The
[Citizens'] league was fulsome in its praise of Glass, and bankers felt
greater and greater confidence as Colonel House began visiting Glass and
showing interest in his currency measure...
The new President admitted 'lie knew nothing" about banking theory or
practice. Glass made the same confession to Colonel House in November, and
this vacuum is of the utmost significance.
The entire banking reform
movement, at all crucial stages, was centralized in the hands of a few men
who for years were linked, ideologically and personally with one another.1
THE GLASS-OWEN BILL EMERGES
In his Committee House Report in 1913, Glass objected to the Aldrich Bill on
the following grounds:
It lacked government control, he said; it
concentrated power into the hands of the larger New York banks; it opened
the door to inflation; it was dishonest in its estimate of cost to the
taxpayer; and it established a banking monopoly.
All of which was correct.
What the country needed, Glass said,
was an entirely fresh approach, a genuine reform bill which was not written
by agents of the Money Trust and which would truly meet the needs of the
common man. That, too, was quite correct. Then he brought forth his own
bill, drafted by Willis fend inspired by Laughlin, which in every important
detail was merely the old corpse of the Aldrich Bill pulled from its
casket, freshly perfumed, and dressed in a new suit.
The Glass Bill was soon reconciled with a similar measure sponsored by
Senator Robert L. Owen and it emerged as the Glass-Owen Bill.
Although there were initially some minor
differences between Glass and Owen on the proper degree of government control over banking, Owen was basically of identical
mind to Willis and Laughlin. While serving in the Senate, he also was the
president of a bank in Oklahoma. Like Aldrich, he had made several trips to
Europe to study the central banks of England and Germany, and these were the
models for his legislation.
The less technically minded members of the cartel became (nervous over the
anti-Wall Street rhetoric of the Bill's sponsors.
Warburg, in an attempt
to quell their fears and, at the same time, strengthen his private boast
that he had been the real author, published a side-by-side comparison of the
Aldrich and Glass proposals. The analysis showed that, not only were the two
bills in agreement on all essential provisions, but they even contained
entire sections that were identical in their wording.
He wrote:
"Brushing
aside, then, the external differences affecting the 'shells,' we find the
'kernels' of the two systems very closely resembling and related to one
another."2
It was important for the success of the Glass Bill to create the Impression
it was in response to the views of a broad cross section of the financial
community- To this end.
Glass and his committee staged public hearings for
the announced purpose of giving everyone a chance for input to the process.
It was, of course, a sham. The first draft of the Bill had already been
completed in secret several months before the hearings were held. And, as
was customary in such matters, Congressman Lindbergh and other witnesses
opposing the Jekyll Island plan were not allowed to speak.
1. Warburg Vol. I, p798. 1 fttf. p.412
The hearings were widely
reported in the press, and the public was given the impression that the
favorable testimony was truly representative of expert opinion.
Kolko
summarizes:
Although they were careful to keep the contents of their work confidential,
to aid the passage of any bill that might be agreed upon Glass deemed it
desirable to hold public hearings on the topic and to make sure the course
of these hearings was not left to chance...
The public assumption of the
hearing was that no bills had been drafted, and Willis' draft was never
mentioned, much less revealed... The hearings of Glass' subcommittee in
January and February, 1913, were nothing less than a love feast.
BANKERS BECOME DIVIDED
The public was not the only victim of deception.
The bankers themselves were
also targeted - at least the lesser ones who were not part of the Wall
Street power center. As early as February, 1911, a group of twenty-two of
the country's most powerful bankers met for three days behind closed doors
in Atlantic City to work out a strategy for getting the smaller banks to
support the concept of using the government to authorize and maintain their
own cartel.
The objective frankly discussed among those present was that the
proposed cartel would bring the smaller banks under control of the larger
ones, but that this fact had to be obscured when presenting it to them for
endorsement.
1. Lindbergh, p. 129.
2. Kolko, Triumph, p. 225.
3. Rothbard, Crisis, p. 101. Also Kolko, Triumph, p. 186.
The annual meeting of the American Bankers Association was held a few months
later, and a resolution endorsing the Aldrich Bill was steam rollered
through the plenary session, much to the dismay of many of those present.
Andrew Frame was one of them.
Representing a group of Western bankers, he
testified at the hearings of the Glass subcommittee, mentioned previously,
and described the hoax:
When that monetary bill was given to the country, it was but a few days
previous to the meeting of the American Bankers Association in New Orleans
in 1911. There was not one banker in a hundred who had read that bill. We
had twelve addresses in favor of it.
General Hamby of Austin, Texas, wrote a
letter to President Watts asking for a hearing against the bill. He did not
get a very courteous answer. I refused to vote on it, and a great many other
bankers did likewise... They would not allow anyone on the program who was
not in favor of the bill.
It is interesting that during Frame's testimony, Congressman Glass refrained
from commenting on the unfairness of allowing only one side of an issue to
be heard in a public forum. He could [hardly afford to. That is exactly what
he was then doing with his own agenda.
As the Federal Reserve Act moved closer to its birth in the form of the
Glass-Owen Bill (Owen was the co-sponsor in the Senate), both Aldrich and
Vanderlip threw themselves into a great public display of opposition.
No opportunity was overlooked to make a
statement to the press - or anyone else of public prominence - expressing
their eternal animosity to this monstrous legislation. Vanderlip warned against the evils of fiat money and rampant
inflation. Aldrich charged that the Glass-Owen Bill was inimical to sound
banking and good government.
Vanderlip predicted speculation and instability
in the stock market.
Aldrich sourly complained that the bill was
"revolutionary in its character" (implying Bolshevistic) and "will be the
first and most important step toward changing our form of government from a democracy to an autocracy.
THE PRETENSE IS DROPPED
That all of this was merely high-level showmanship was made clear when
Vanderlip accepted a debate with Congressman Glass before the New York
Economic Society on November 13.
There were eleven hundred bankers and
businessmen present, and Vanderlip was under pressure to make a good showing
before this impressive group.
The debate was going badly for him and, in a
moment of desperation, he finally dropped the pretense.
"For years" he
said, "bankers have been almost the sole advocates of Bust this sort of
legislation that it is now hoped we will have, and it is unfair to accuse
them of being in opposition to sound legislation."
Twenty-two years later,
when the need for pretense had long passed, Vanderlip was even more candid.
Writing in the Saturday Evening Post, he said:
"Although the Aldrich Federal Reserve Plan
was defeated when it bore the name Aldrich, nevertheless its essential
points were all contained in the plan that finally was adopted."
In his autobiography, Treasury Secretary William McAdoo offers this view:
Bankers fought the Federal Reserve legislation - and every provision of the
Federal Reserve Act - with the tireless energy of men fighting a forest
fire. They said it was populistic, socialistic, half-baked, destructive,
infantile, badly conceived, and unworkable...
These interviews with bankers led me to an interesting conclusion.
I
perceived gradually, through all the haze and smoke of controversy, that the
banking world was not really as opposed to the bill as it pretended to be.2
That is the key to this entire episode: mass psychology.
Since Aldrich was
recognized as associated with the Morgan interests and Vanderlip was
President of Rockefeller's National City Bank, the public was skillfully led
to believe that the "Money Trust" was mortally afraid of the proposed
Federal Reserve Act.
The Nation was the only prominent publication to point
out that every one of the horrors described by Aldrich and Vanderlip could
have been equally ascribed to the Aldrich Bill as well. But this lone voice
was easily drowned by the great cacophony of deception and propaganda.
2. McAdoo, pp. 213,225-26.
The Glass Bill was a flexible document which was designed from the beginning
to be altered in non-essential matters in order to appear as though
compromises were being made to satisfy the various political factions. Since
very few understood central-bank technicalities, the ploy was easy to
execute.
The basic strategy was to focus debate on such relatively
unimportant items as the number of regional banks, the structure of the
governing board, and the process by which that board was to be selected.
When truly crucial matters could not be avoided, the response was to agree
to almost anything but to write the provisions in vague language. In that
way, the back door would be left ajar for later implementation of the
original intent. The goal was to get the bill passed and perfect it later.
House and Warburg feared that, if they waited until they had everything they
wanted, they would get nothing at all or, worse, that opponents of a central
bank would be able to muster their forces and pass a reform bill of their
own; a real one.
Willis was quick to agree. In a letter to his former
professor, he wrote:
"It is much better to take a half a loaf rather than to
be absolutely deprived of a chance of getting any bread whatsoever... The
so-called 'progressive' element - such as Lindbergh and his supporters -
will be encouraged to enact dangerous legislation."
Glass echoed the
sentiment.
Directing his remarks at those smaller banks which were resisting
domination by the New York banks, he said:
"Unless the conservative bankers
of the country are willing to yield something and get behind the bill, we
shall get legislation very much less to be desired, or have nothing done at
all."
BRYAN MAKES AN ULTIMATUM
The Populist, William Jennings Bryan, was considered at that time to be the
most influential Democrat in Congress, and it was clear from the start that
the Federal Reserve Act could never be passed without his approval and
support.
As Charles Seymour observed:
"The Commoner's sense of loyalty [to
the Party] had kept him from an attack upon the Federal Reserve Act which,
it would appear, he never entirely understood... With his influence in the
Party, he could have destroyed the measure which failed to accord with his
personal doctrines."
Bryan had said that he would not support any bill that resulted in private
money being issued by private banks.
The money supply, he insisted, must be
government issue. When he finally saw an actual draft of the bill in
midsummer of 1913, he was dismayed to find that, not only was the money to
be privately issued, but the entire governing body of the central bank was
to be composed of private bankers. His ultimatum was not long in corning.
He
hotly demanded,
(1) that the Federal-Reserve notes must be Treasury currency,
issued and guaranteed by the government
(2) that
the governing body must be appointed by the President and approved by the
Senate
Colonel House and the other monetary scientists were reasonably sure that
these provisions eventually would be required for final approval of the bill
but, being master strategists, they deliberately withheld them from early
drafts so they could be used as bargaining points and added later as
concessions in a show of compromise.
Furthermore, since practically no one
really understood the technical aspects of the measure, they knew it would
be easy to fool their opponents by creating the appearance of compromise
when, in actual operation, the originally intended features would remain.
AN AMAZING REVELATION
The nature of this deception was spelled out years later by Carter Glass in
his book, Adventures in Constructive Finance.
From this source we learn
that, after Bryan had delivered his ultimatum, Glass was summoned to the
White House and told by Wilson that the decision had been made to make the
Federal Reserve notes obligations of the United States government.
"I was
for an instant speechless!" wrote Glass who then explained how he reminded
the President that the only backing for the new currency would be a small
amount of gold, a large amount of government and commercial debt, and the
private assets of the individual banks themselves.
"It would be a pretense
on its face," he said.
"Was there ever a government note based primarily on
the property of banking institutions? Was there ever a government issue not
one dollar of which could be put out except by demand of a bank? The
suggested government obligation is so remote it could never be discovered."
To which the President replied:
"Exactly so, Glass. Every word you say is
true; the government liability is a mere thought. And so, if we can hold the
substance of the thing and give the other fellow the shadow, why not do it,
if thereby we may save our bill?"1
Years later, Paul Warburg would explain further:
While technically and legally the Federal Reserve note is an obligation of
the United States Government, in reality it is an obligation, the sole
actual responsibility for which rests on the reserve banks... The
government could only be called upon to take them up after the reserve banks
had failed.1
Warburg's explanation should be carefully analyzed. It is an incredibly
important statement.
The man who masterminded the Federal Reserve System is
telling us that Federal Reserve notes constitute privately issued money with
the taxpayers standing by to cover the potential losses of those banks which
issue it. One of the more controversial assertions of this book is that the
objectives set forth at the Jekyll Island meeting included the shifting of
the cartel's losses from the owners of the banks to the taxpayers.
Warburg
himself has confirmed it.
But let us return to the great deceit of 1913. The second demand made by
Bryan - political control over the System, not banker control - was met with
an equally beguiling "compromise."
In addition to the governing board of
regional bankers previously proposed, there now would be a central
regulatory commission, to be called the Federal Reserve Board, appointed by
the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Thus, the public
was to be protected through a sharing of power, a melding of interests, a
system of checks and balances.
In this way, said Wilson,
"the banks may be
instruments, not the masters, of business and of individual enterprise and
initiative."
The arrangement was heralded as a bold, new experiment in representative
government.
In reality, it was but the return of the ancient partnership
between the monetary and political scientists. The only thing new was that
power was now to be shared openly in plain view of the public. But, of
course, there would not be much to see. All the deliberations and most of
the decisions were to happen behind closed doors.
Furthermore, the division
of power and responsibility between these groups was left deliberately
vague. Without a detailed line of command or even a clear concept of
function, it was inevitable that, as with the drafting of the bill itself,
real power would gravitate into the hands of those with technical knowledge
and Wall Street connections.
To the monetary scientists drafting the bill
and engineering the compromises, the eventual concentration of effective
control into their hands was never in serious doubt.
And, as we shall see in
the next chapter, subsequent events have proved the soundness of that
strategy.
BRYAN ENDORSES THE BILL
Bryan was no match for the Jekyll Island strategists and he accepted the
"compromises" at face value. Had there been any lingering doubts in his
mind, they were swept away by gratitude for his appointment as Wilson's
Secretary of State.
Now that he was on the team, he declared:
I appreciate so profoundly the service rendered by the President to the
people in the stand he has taken on the fundamental principles involved in
currency reform, that 1 am with him in all the details... The right of the
government to issue money is not surrendered to the banks; the control over
the money so issued is not relinquished by the government...
I am glad to
endorse earnestly and unreservedly the currency bill as a much better
measure than I supposed it possible to secure at this time... Conflicting
opinions have been reconciled with a success hardly to have been expected.
With the conversion of Bryan, there was no longer any doubt about the final
outcome.
The Federal Reserve Act was released from the joint House and
Senate conference committee on December 22, 1913, just as Congress was
preoccupied with departure for the Christmas recess and in no mood for
debate. It quickly passed by a vote of 282 to 60 in the House and 43 to 23
in the Senate. The President signed it into law the next day.
The Creature had swallowed Congress.
SUMMARY
President Taft, although a Republican spokesman for big business, refused to
champion the Aldrich Bill for a central bank.
This marked him for political
extinction.
The Money Trust wanted a President who would aggressively
promote the bill, and the man selected was Woodrow Wilson who had already
publicly declared his allegiance. Wilson's nomination at the Democratic
national convention was secured by Colonel House, a close associate of
Morgan and Warburg.
To make sure that Taft did not win his bid for
reelection, the Money Trust encouraged the former Republican President,
Teddy Roosevelt, to run on the Progressive ticket. The result, as planned, was that Roosevelt pulled away Republican
support from
Taft, and Wilson won the election with less than a ^majority vote.
Wilson
and Roosevelt campaigned vigorously against the evils of the Money Trust
while, all along, being dependent upon that same Trust for campaign funding.
When Wilson was elected, Colonel House literally moved into [the White House
and became the unseen President of the United States. Under his guidance,
the Aldrich Bill was given cosmetic forgery and emerged as the Glass-Owen
Bill. Although sponsored by Democrats, in all essential features it was
still the Jekyll Island plan.
Aldrich, Vanderlip, and others identified
with Wall Street put on a pretense of opposing the Glass-Owen Bill to
convince Congress and the public that big bankers were fearful of it. The
final bill was written with many sound features which were included to make
it palatable during Congressional debate but [which were predesigned to be
dropped in later years.
To win the support of the Populists under the
leadership of William Jennings Bryan, the Jekyll Island team also engineered
what appeared to be compromises but which in actual operation were, as
Wilson called them, mere "shadows" while the "substance" remained. In
short, Congress was outflanked, outfoxed, and outclassed by a deceptive, but
brilliant, psycho-political attack.
The result is that, on December 23,1913,
America once again had a central bank.
Chapter Twenty-Three
THE GREAT DUCK DINNER
How Federal-Reserve policies led to the crash of 1929; the expansion of the
money supply as a means of helping the economy of England; the resulting
wave of speculation in stocks and real estate; evidence that the
Federal-Reserve Board had foreknowledge of the crash and even executed the
events that were designed to trigger it.
The story is told of a New England farmer with a small pond in his pasture.
Each summer, a group of wild ducks would frequent
that pond but, try as he
would, the farmer could never catch one. No matter how early in the
morning he approached, or how carefully he constructed a blind, or what kind
of duck call he tried, somehow those crafty birds sensed the danger and
managed to be hut of range.
Of course, when fall arrived, the ducks headed
South, fend the farmer's craving for a duck dinner only intensified.
Then he got an idea.
Early in the spring, he started scattering corn along
the edge of the pond. The ducks liked the corn and, since it was always
there, they soon gave up dipping and foraging for food of their own. After a
while, they became used to the farmer and began to trust him. They could see
he was their benefactor and they now walked close to him with no sense of
fear. Life was so easy, they forgot how to fly. But that was unimportant,
because they were now so fat they couldn't have gotten off the water even
if they had tried.
Fall came, and the ducks stayed. Winter came, and the pond froze. The
farmer built a shelter to keep them warm. The ducks mere happy because they
didn't have to fly. And the farmer was especially happy because, each week
all winter long, he had a delicious duck dinner.
That is the story of America's Great Depression of the 1930s.
CONSOLIDATION OF POWER
When the Federal Reserve Act was submitted to Congress, many of its most
important features were written in vague language.
Some details were omitted
entirely. That was a tactical move to avoid debate over fine points and to
allow flexibility for future interpretation. The goal was to get the bill
passed and perfect it later. Since then, the Act has been amended 195 times,
expanding the power and scope of the System to the point where, today, it
would be almost unrecognizable to the Congressmen and Senators who voted for
it.
In 1913, public distaste for concentration of financial power in the hands
of a few Wall Street banks helped to fuel the fire for passage of the
Federal Reserve Act.
To make it appear that the new System would put an end
to the New York "money trust," as it was called, the public was told that
the Federal Reserve would not represent any one group or one region.
Instead, it would have its power diffused over twelve regional Federal
Reserve Banks, and none would be able to dominate.
As Galbraith pointed out,
however, the regional design was,
"admirable for serving local pride and
architectural ambition and for lulling the suspicions of the agrarians."
But
that was not what the planners had in mind for the long haul.
In the beginning, the regional branches took their autonomy seriously, and
that led to conflict with members of the national board. The Board of
Governors was composed of political appointees representing diverse segments
of the economy.
They were outclassed by the heads of the regional branches
of the System who were bankers with bankers experience.
1. Galbraith, p. 130.
RETURN OF THE NEW YORK "MONEY TRUST"
The greatest power struggle arose from the New York Reserve Bank which was
headed by Benjamin Strong.
Strong had the contacts and the experience. It
will be recalled that he was one of the seven who drafted the cartel's
structure at Jekyll Island. He had been head of J.P. Morgan's Bankers Trust
Company and was closely associated with Edward Mandell House.
He had become
a personal friend of Montagu Norman, head of the Bank of England, and of
Charles Rist, head of the Bank of France. Not least of all, he was head of
the New York branch of the System which represented the nation's largest
banks, the "money trust" itself.
From the outset, the national board and the
regional branches were dominated by the New York branch. Strong ruled as an
autocrat, determining Fed policy often without even consulting with the
Federal Reserve Board in Washington.
The United States entry into World War I provided the impetus for increasing
the power of the Fed. The System became the sole fiscal agent of the
Treasury, Federal Reserve Notes were issued, virtually all of the gold
reserves of the nation's commercial banks were gathered together into the
vaults of the Federal System, and many of the legislative restraints placed
into the original Act were abandoned. Voters ask fewer questions when their
nation is at war.
The concentration of power into the hands of the very "money trust" the Fed
was supposed to defeat, is described by Ferdinand Lundberg, author of
America's Sixty Families:
In practice, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York became the fountainhead of
the system of twelve regional banks, for New York was the money market of
the nation.
The other eleven banks were so many expensive mausoleums erected
to salve the local pride and quell the Jacksonian fears of the hinterland.
Benjamin Strong... president of the Bankers Trust Company [J.P. Morgan] was
selected as the first Governor of the New York Reserve Bank.
An adept in high
finance, Strong for many years manipulated the country's monetary system at
the discretion of directors representing the leading New York banks. Under
Strong the Reserve System, unsuspected by the nation, was brought into
interlocking relations with the Bank of England and the Bank of France.
BAILING OUT EUROPE
It will be recalled from Chapters Twelve and Twenty that it was this
interlock during World War I that was responsible for the confiscation from
American taxpayers of billions of dollars which were given to the central
banks of England and France.
Much of that money found its way to the
associates of J.P. Morgan as interest payments on war bonds and as fees for
supplying munitions and other war materials.
Seventy per cent of the cost of World War I was paid by inflation rather
than taxes, a process that was orchestrated by the
Federal Reserve System. This was considered by the Fed's supporters as its
first real test, and it passed with flying colors. American inflation during
that period was only slightly less than in England, which had been more
deeply committed to war and for a longer period of time.
That is not
surprising inasmuch as a large portion of Europe's war costs had been
transferred to the American taxpayers.
After the war was over, the transfusion of American dollars continued as
part of a plan to pull England out of depression. The methods chosen for
that transfer were artificially low interest rates and a deliberate
inflation of the American money supply. That was calculated to weaken the
value of the dollar relative to the English pound and cause gold reserves to
move from America to England.
Both operations were directed by Benjamin
Strong and executed by the Federal Reserve. It was not hyperbole when
President Herbert Hoover described Strong as "a mental annex to Europe."
Before Alan Greenspan was appointed as Chairman of the Federal Reserve by
President Reagan in 1987, he had served on the Board of the J.P. Morgan
Company. Before that, however, he had been an outspoken champion of the gold
standard and a critic of the System's subservience to the banking cartel.
In
1966 he wrote:
When business in the United States underwent a mild contraction in 1927, the
Federal Reserve created more paper reserves in the hope of forestalling any
possible bank reserve shortage. More disastrous, however, was the Federal
Reserve's attempt to assist Great Britain who had been losing gold to us...
The "Fed" succeeded: it stopped the gold loss, but it nearly destroyed the
economies of the world in the process. The excess credit which the Fed
pumped into the economy spilled over into the stock market - triggering a
fantastic speculative boom... As a result, the American economy collapsed.
After his appointment to the Fed, Greenspan became silent on these issues
and did nothing to anger the Creature he now served.
1. Galbraith, p, 180.
AGENTS OF A HIGHER POWER
When reviewing this aspect of the Fed's history, questions arise about the
patriotic loyalty of men like Benjamin Strong.
How is it possible for a man
who enjoys the best that his nation can offer - security, wealth, prestige's
- to conspire to plunder his fellow citizens in order to assist politicians
of other governments to continue plundering theirs?
The first part of the answer was illustrated in
earlier sections of this book. International money managers may be citizens
of a particular country but, to many of them, that is a meaningless accident
of birth. They consider themselves to be citizens of the world first. They
speak of affection for all mankind, but their highest loyalty is to
themselves and their profession.
That is only half the answer.
It must be remembered that the men who
pulled the financial levers on this doomsday machine, the governors of the
Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, were themselves tied to strings
which were pulled by others above them.
Their minds were not obsessed with
concepts of nationalism or even internationalism. Their loyalties were to
men.
Professor Quigley reminds us:
It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief central banks were
themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not.
Rather, they
were the technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their
own countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing
them down.
The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands
of these investment bankers (also called "international" or "merchant"
bankers) who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated
private banks. These formed a system of international ' cooperation and
national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret
than that of their agents in the central
banks.
So, we are not dealing with the actions of men who perceive themselves as
betraying their nation, but technicians who are loyal lo the monetary
scientists and the political scientists who raised them up. Of the two
groups, the financiers are dominant.
Politicians come and go, but those who
wield the power of money remain to pick their successors.
FARMERS BECOME DUCK DINNER
During the war, prices for agricultural products rose to an all-time high,
and so did profits.
Farmers had put part of that money into war bonds, but
much of it had been placed into savings accounts at banks within the farming
communities, which is to say, mostly in the Midwest and South. That was
unacceptable to the
New York banks which saw their share of the nation's deposits begin to
decline. A way had to be devised to reclaim that money. The Federal Reserve
System, which by then was the captive of the New York banks, was pressed
into service to accomplish the deed.
Few of those country banks had chosen to become members of the Federal
Reserve System. That added insult to injury, and it also provided an excuse
for the Fed to wage economic war against them. The plan was neither complex
nor original; it had been used many times before by central bankers.
It was,
(1) extend easy credit to the farmers to lure them into heavy debt, and then
(2) create a recession which would decrease their income to the point where
they could not make payments
The country banks then would find themselves
holding non-performing loans and foreclosed property which they could not
sell without tremendous losses. In the end, both the farmers and the banks
would be wiped out. The banks were the target. Too bad about the farmers.
Congressman Charles Lindbergh, Sr., father of the man who made the world's
first solo transatlantic flight, explained it this way:
"Under the Federal
Reserve Act, panics are scientifically created; the present panic is the
first scientifically created one, worked out as we figure a mathematical
problem."
The details of how this panic was created were explained in 1939 by Senator
Robert Owen, Chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee. Owen,
a banker himself, had been a coauthor of the Federal Reserve Act, a role he
later regretted.
Owen said:
In May 1920 ... the farmers were exceedingly prosperous...
They were paying off their mortgages. They had bought a lot of new land,
at the instance of the government - had borrowed money to do it - and
then they were bankrupted by a sudden contraction of credit and
currency, which took place in 1920...
The Federal Reserve Board met in a meeting which was not disclosed to the
public - they met on the 18th of May 1920; it was a secret meeting - and
they spent all day; the minutes made 60 printed pages, and it appears in
Senate Document 310 of February 10,1923...
Under action taken by the Reserve
Board on May 18, 1920, there resulted a violent contraction of credit...
This contraction of credit and currency had the effect, the next year, of
diminishing the national production $15,000,000,000; it had the effect of
throwing millions of people out of employment; it had the effect of reducing
the value of lands and ranches $20,000,000,000.1
The contraction of credit had a disastrous effect on the nation as a whole,
not just farmers.
But the farmers were more deeply Involved, because the
recently created Federal Farm Loan Board had lured them with easy credit -
like ducks at the pond - into extreme debt ratios.
Furthermore, the
large-city banks which were members of the System were given support by
the Fed during the (summer of 1920 to enable them to extend credit to
manufacturers and merchants. That allowed many of them to ride out the
slump. There was no such support for the farmers or the country banks
which, by 1921, were falling like dominoes. History books refer to [this
event as the Agricultural Depression of 1920-21.
A better name would have
been Country-Duck Dinner in New York.
BUILDING THE MANDRAKE MECHANISM
In Chapter Ten, we examined the three methods by which the Federal Reserve
is able to create or extinguish money.
Of the three, the purchase and sale
of debt-related securities in the open market is the one that provides the
greatest effect on the money supply, the purchase of securities by the Fed
(with checks that have no money to back them) creates money; the sale of
those securities extinguishes money.
Although the Fed is authorized to buy
and sell almost any kind of security that exists in the world, it is
obligated to show preference for bonds and notes of the federal government,
that is the way the monetary scientists discharge the commitment [to create
money for their partners, the political scientists. Without that service,
the partnership would dissolve, and Congress would abolish the Fed.
When the System was created in 1913, it was anticipated that the primary way
to manipulate the money supply would be to control the "reserve ratios" and
the "discount window." That is banker language for setting the level of
mandatory bank reserves (as a percentage of deposits) and also setting the
interest rate on loans made by the Fed to the banks themselves.
The reserve
ratio under the old National Bank Act had been 25%. Under the Federal
Reserve Act of 1913, it was reduced to 18% for the large New York
banks, a drop of 28%. In 1917, just four years later, the reserve
requirements for Central Reserve-City Banks were further dropped from 18% to
13% (with slightly lesser reductions for smaller banks).
That was an
additional 28% cut.1
It quickly became apparent that setting reserve ratios was an inefficient
tool. The latitude of control was too small, and the amount of public
attention too great. The second method, influencing the interest rate on
commercial loans, was more useful.
Here is how that works:
Under a fractional-reserve banking system, a bank can create new money
merely by issuing a loan. The amount of new money it creates is limited by
the reserve ratio or "fraction" it is required to maintain to cover its
cash-flow needs.
If the reserve ratio is 10%, then each $10 it lends
includes $9 that never existed before.
A commercial bank, therefore, can
create a sizable amount of money merely by making loans. But, once the bank
is "loaned up," that is to say, once the bank has already loaned $9 for
every $1 it holds in reserve, it must stop and wait for some of the old
loans to be paid back before it can issue new ones. The only way to expand
that process is to make the reserves larger.
That can be accomplished in one
of three ways:
(1) use some of the bank's profits
(2) sell additional stock
to investors
(3) borrow money from the Fed
WHEN BANKS BORROW FROM THE FED
The third option is the most popular and is called going to the "discount
window."
When banks go to the Fed's discount window to obtain a loan, they
are expected to put up collateral. This can be almost any debt contract held
by the bank, including government bonds, but it commonly consists of
commercial loans. The Fed then grants credit to the bank in an amount equal
to those contracts. In essence, this allows the bank to convert its old
loans into new "reserves."
Every dollar of those new reserves then can be
used as the basis for lending nine more dollars in checkbook money!
The process does not stop there. Once the new loans are made, they, too, can
be used as collateral at the Fed for still more reserves. The music goes
'round and 'round, with each new level of debt becoming "reserves" for yet
a higher level of loans, until it finally days itself out at about
twenty-eight times.1
That process is commonly called "discounting commercial
paper."
It was one of the means by which the Fed was able to flood the
nation with new money prior to the Great Dam Rupture of 1929.
But, there is a problem with that method, at least as far as the Fed is
concerned. Even though interest rates at the discount window can be made so
low that most bankers will line up like ducks looking for free corn, some
of them - particularly those "hicks" in the country banks - have been known
to resist the .temptation.
There is no way to force the banks to
participate. Furthermore, the banks themselves are dependent upon the whims
of their customers who, for reasons known only to themselves, may not want
to borrow as much as the bank wants to lend. If the customers stop
borrowing, then the banks have no new loans to convert into further
reserves.
That left the third mechanism as the preferred option: the purchase and sale
of bonds and other debt obligations in the open market.
With the discount
window, banks have to be enticed to borrow money which later must be repaid,
and sometimes they are reluctant to do that. But with the open market, all
the Fed has to do is write a fiat check to pay for the securities. When that
check is cashed, the new money it created moves directly into the economy
without any concurrence required from the recalcitrant banks.
But, there was a problem with this method also. Before World War I, there
were few government bonds available on the open market. Even after the war,
the supply was limited. Which means the vast inflation that preceded the
Crash of 1929 was not caused by deficit spending. In each year from 1920
through 1930 there was a surplus of government revenue over expenses.
Surprising as it may be, on the eve of the depression, America was getting
out of debt. As a consequence, there were few government bonds for the Fed
to buy. Without government bonds, the open-market engine was constantly
running out of gas.
The solution to all these problems was to create a new market tailor-made to
the Fed's needs, a kind of half-way house between
the discount window and the open market.
It was called the "acceptance
window," and it was through that imagery that the System purchased a unique
type of debt-related security called bankers acceptances.
BANKER'S ACCEPTANCES
Banker's acceptances are contracts promising payment for commercial goods
scheduled for later delivery.
They usually involve international trade where
delays of three to six months are common. They are a means by which a seller
in one country can ship goods to an unknown buyer in another country with
confidence that he will be paid upon delivery. That is accomplished through
guarantees made by the banks of both buyer and seller.
First, the buyer's
bank issues a letter of credit guaranteeing payment for the goods, even if
the buyer should default. When the seller's bank recewes this, one of its
officers writes the word "accepted" on the contract and pays the seller the
amount of the sale.
The accepting bank, therefore, advances the money to the
seller in expectation of receiving future payment from the buyer's bank.
For
this service, both banks charge a fee expressed as a percentage of the
contract. Thus, the buyer pays a little more than the amount of the sales
contract, and the seller receives a little less.
Historically, these contracts have been safe, because the banks are careful
to guarantee payment only for financially sound firms. But, in times of
economic panic, even sound firms may be unable to honor their contracts. It
was underwriting that kind of business that nearly bankrupted George Peabody
and J.P. Morgan in London during the panic of 1857, and would have done so
had they not been bailed out by the Bank of England.
Acceptances, like commercial loan contracts, are negotiable instruments that
can be traded in the securities market.
The accepting banks have a choice of
holding them until maturity or selling them. If they hold them, their profit
will be realized when the underlying contract is eventually paid off and it
will be equal to the amount of its "discount," which is banker language for
its fee. Acceptances are said to be "rediscounted" when they are sold by the
original discounter, the underwriter.
The advantage of doing that is that
they do not have to wait three to six months for their profit. They can
acquire immediate capital which can be invested to earn interest.
The sale price of an acceptance is always less than the value of the
underlying contracts; otherwise no one would buy them.
The difference
represents the potential profit to the buyer. It is expressed as a
percentage and is called the "rate" of discount - or, in this case,
rediscount. But the rate given by the seller must be lower than what he
expects to earn with the money he receives, otherwise he will be better off
not selling.
Although bankers' acceptances were commonly traded in Europe, they were not
popular in the United States. Before the Federal Reserve Act was passed,
national banks had been prohibited from purchasing them.
A market, therefore, had to be created.
The Fed accomplished this by setting the
discount rate on acceptances so low that underwriters would have been
foolish not to take advantage of it. At a very low discount, they could
acquire short-term funds which then could be invested at a higher rate of return. Thus, acceptances quickly became plentiful on the open market in the
United States.
But who would want to buy them at a low return? No one, of course. So, to
create that market, not only did the Federal Reserve set the discount rate
artificially low, it also pledged to buy all of the acceptances that were
offered. The Fed, therefore, became the principal buyer of these securities.
Banks also came into the market has buyers, but only because they knew that,
at any time they wanted to sell, the Fed was pledged to buy.
Since the money was being created out of nothing, the cost did hot really
matter, nor did the low profit potential.
The Fed's goal was not to make a
profit on investment. It was to increase the nation's money supply.
WARBURG AND FRIENDS MAKE A LITTLE PROFIT
The man who benefited most from this artificially created market was none
other than Paul Warburg, a partner with Kuhn, Loeb and Co. Warburg was in
attendance at the Jekyll Island meeting at which the Federal Reserve System
was conceived.
He was considered by all to have been the master
theoretician who led the others in their deliberations. He was one of the
most influential voices in the public debates that followed. He had been
appointed is one of the first members of the Federal Reserve Board and later
became its Vice Governor until outbreak of war, at which time he resigned
because of publicity regarding his connections with
German banking.
He was a director of American LG. Chemical Corp. and Agfa Ansco, Inc., firms that were controlled by
I.G. Farben, the infamous German
cartel that, only a few years later, would sponsor the rise to power of
Adolph Hitler.
He was also a director of
the CFR (Council on Foreign
Relations). It should not be surprising, therefore, to learn that he was
able to position himself at the center of the huge cash flow resulting from
the Fed's purchase of acceptances.
Warburg was the founder and Chairman of the International Acceptance Bank of
New York, the world's largest acceptance bank. He was also a director of
several smaller "competitors," including the prestigious Westinghouse
Acceptance Bank. He was founder and Chairman of the American Acceptance
Council. Warburg was the acceptance market in America.
But he was not
without friends who also swam in the river of money. Men who controlled
America's largest financial institutions became directors or officers of the
various acceptance banks.
The list of companies that became part of the
interlocking directorate included,
-
Kuhn, Loeb and Co.
-
New York Trust Co.
-
Bank of Manhattan Trust Co.
-
American Trust Co.
-
New York Title and Mortgage
Co.
-
Chase National Bank
-
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
-
American Express
Co.
-
the Carnegie Corp.
-
Guaranty Trust Co.
-
Mutual Life Insurance Co.
-
the
Equitable Life Assurance Society of New York
-
the First National Banks
of Boston, St. Louis, and Los Angeles,
...to name just a few.
The world of
acceptance banking was the private domain of the financial elite of Wall
Street.
Behind the American image, however, was a full partnership with investors
from Europe. Total capital of the IAB's American shareholders was $276
million compared with $271 million from foreign investors.
A significant
portion of that was divided between,
Just how large and free-flowing was that river of acceptance money? In 1929,
it was 1.7 trillion-dollars wide.
Throughout the 1920s, it was over half of
all the new money created by the Federal Reserve - greater than all the
other purchases on the open market plus all the loans to all the banks
standing in line at the discount window.
The monetary scientists who created the Federal Reserve, and their close
business associates, were well-rewarded for their efforts. Profit-taking by
insiders, however, is not the issue. Far more important is the fact that the
consequence of this self-serving mechanism was the massive expansion of the
money supply that made the Great Depression inevitable.
And that is the
topic which impelled us to look at acceptances in the first place.
CONGRESS SUSPICIOUS BUT AFRAID TO TINKER
By 1920, suspicions and resentment were growing in the halls of Congress.
Politicians were not getting their share. It is possible
that many of them
failed to realize that, as partners in the scheme, they were entitled to a
share. Nevertheless, they were dazzled by banker language and accounting
tricks and were afraid to tinker with the System lest they accidentally push
the wrong button.
Watching with amusement from London was Fabian Socialist John Maynard
Keynes.
Speaking of the Federal Reserve's manipulation of the value of the
dollar, he wrote:
That is the way by which a rich country is able to combine new wisdom with
old prejudice. It can enjoy the latest scientific improvements, devised in
the economic laboratory of Harvard, whilst leaving Congress to believe that
no rash departure will be permitted...
But there is in all such fictions a
certain instability... The suspicions of Congressmen may be aroused. One
cannot be quite certain that some Senator might not read and understand this
book.
There was not much danger of that!
By then, American politicians had
acquired a taste for the heady wine of war funding and stopped asking
questions. World War I had created enormous demands for money, and the Fed
provided it.
By the end of the war, Congressional hostility to the Federal
Reserve became history.
PAYING FOR WORLD WAR I
Much of the war debt was absorbed by the public which responded to patriotic
instincts and purchased war bonds.
The treasury launched a massive publicity
campaign for "Liberty loans" to reinforce that sentiment. These small-denomination bonds
did not expand the money supply and did not cause inflation, because the
money came from savings. It already existed.
However, many people who
thought it was their patriotic duty to support the war effort went to their
banks and borrowed money so they could buy bonds. The bank created most of
that money out of nothing, drawing upon credits and bookkeeping entries from
the Federal Reserve, so those purchases did inflate the money supply.
The
same result could have been obtained more simply and less expensively by
getting the money directly from the Fed, but the government encouraged the
trend anyway, because of its psychological value in generating popular
support for the war. When people make sacrifices for an endeavor, it
reinforces their belief that it must be worthy.
Although the war was financed partly by taxes and partly by Liberty Bonds
purchased by the public, a significant portion was covered by the sale of
Treasury bonds to the Federal Reserve in the open market.
Benjamin Strong's
biographer, Lester Chandler, explains:
The Federal Reserve System became an integral part of the war financing
machinery. The System's overriding objective, both as a creator of money and
as fiscal agent, was to insure that the Treasury would be supplied with all
the money it needed, and on terms fixed by Congress and the Treasury...
A
grateful nation now hailed it as a major contributor to the winning of the
war, an efficient fiscal agent for the Treasury, a great source of currency
and reserve funds, and a permanent and indispensable part of the banking
system.
THE EMERGENCE OF GOVERNMENT DEBT
The war years were largely a period of testing new strategies and
consolidating power. Ironically, it was not until after the war - when there
was no longer a justification for deficit spending - that government debt
became plentiful.
Up until World War I, annual federal expenses had been
running about $750 million. By the end of the war, it was running $18
and-a-half billion, an increase of 2,466%. Approximately 70% of the cost of
war had been financed by debt.
Murray Rothbard reminds us that, on the eve
of depression in 1928, ten years after the end of war, the banking system
held more government bonds than during the war itself. That means the
government did not pay off those bonds when they came due. Instead, it
rolled them over by offering new bonds to replace the Wd.
Why? Was it
because Congress needed more money? No.
The bonds had become the basis for
money in circulation and, if they had been redeemed, the money supply would
have decreased. An increase in the money supply is viewed by politicians and
central bankers as a threat to economic stability. Thus, the government
[found itself unable to get out of debt even when it had the money to do so,
a dilemma that continues to this day.
There is an apparent contradiction here. In his book, The Great Boom and
Panic, Robert Patterson says that, on the eve of depression, America was
getting out of debt. Yet, Rothbard tells us there were more government
bonds held by the banking system than [during the war! The only way both
statements can be true is if there were, in fact, more bonds outstanding
during the war but they were held by the public, not by the banking system.
That would make it possible for there to be fewer total bonds in 1928 and
yet the System could still hold more of them than previously. That would be
the expected result of the Fed's growing role in the open market. As the
publicly-held bonds matured, the Treasury rolled them over, and the Fed
picked them up. Bonds purchased by the public do not increase the money
supply whereas those purchased by banks do.
Therefore, conditions in 1928
would have been far more inflationary than during the war - even though the
government was getting out of debt.
Before 1922, the Federal Reserve bought Treasury bonds primarily for three
purposes:
(1) for income to operate the system
(2) lo pay for the newly
issued Federal Reserve Notes which were replacing silver certificates
(3) to push down interest rates
The motive for manipulating interest
rates was to encourage borrowing [from abroad in the United States (where
rates were low).
It also encouraged investment from the United States into
Europe (where fates were higher). By making it possible to borrow American
[dollars at one rate and invest them elsewhere at a higher rate, the red was
deliberately moving money out of the United States, with Bold reserves
following behind.
As President Kennedy had said in
his 1963 address at the IMF, the outflow of American gold "did not come
about by chance."

THE "DISCOVERY" OF THE OPEN MARKET
It is commonly asserted by writers on this topic that the power of the
open-market mechanism to manipulate the money supply was "discovered" by the
Fed in the early 1920s and that it came as a total surprise.
Martin Mayer,
for example, in his book, The Bankers, writes:
Now, through an accident as startling as those which produced the discovery
of X-Rays or penicillin, the central bank learned that "open market
operations" could have a significant effect on the behavior of the banks.
This makes the story interesting, but it is difficult to believe that
Benjamin Strong, Paul Warburg, Montagu Norman, and the other monetary
scientists who were pulling the levers at that time were taken by surprise.
These men could not possibly have been ignorant of the effect of creating
money out of nothing and pouring it into the economy. The open market was
merely a different funnel. If there was any element of surprise, it likely
was only in the ease with which the mechanism could be activated.
It is not
important whether that part of the story is fact or fiction, except that it
perpetuates the "accidental" view of history, the myth that no one is
responsible for political or economic chaos: Things just happen. There was
no master plan. No one is to blame. Everything is under control. Relax, pay
your taxes, and go back to sleep!
In any event, by the end of the war, Congress had awakened to the fact that
it could use the Federal Reserve System to obtain revenue without taxes.
From that point forward, deficit spending became institutionalized. A
gradually increasing issuance of Treasury bonds was encouraging to the Fed
because it provided still one more source of debt to convert into money, a
source that eventually would become far more reliable than either bank loans
or banker's acceptances.
Best of all, now that Congress was becoming
dependent on the free corn, there was little chance it would find its wings
and fly away. The more dependent it became, the more secure the System
itself became.
In 1921, the twelve regional Reserve banks were separately buying and
selling in the open market.
But motives varied. Some merely needed income to
cover their operating overhead, while others - notably the New York branch
under Benjamin Strong - were more interested in sending American gold to
England. Strong began immediately to gather control of all open-market
operations into the hands of his own bank. In June of 1922, the "Open-Market
Committee" was formed to coordinate activities among the regional Governors.
In April of the next year, however, the national board in Washington
replaced the Governor's group with one of its own creation, the "Open-Market
Investments Committee." Benjamin Strong was its chairman.
The powers of that
group were enhanced ten years later by legislation which made it mandatory
for the regional branches to follow the Open-Market Committee's directives,
but that was a mere formality, for the die had been cast much earlier. From
1923 forward, the Fed's open-market operations have been carried out by the
New York Federal Reserve Bank.
The money trust has always been in control.
DROWNING IN CREDIT
Actions have consequences, and one of the consequences of purchasing
Treasury bonds and other debt-related securities in the open market is that
the money created to purchase them eventually ends up in the commercial
banks where it is used for the expansion of bank credit.
"Credit" is another
of those wisely words that have different meanings to different people. In
banker language, She expansion of credit means the banks have "excess
reserves" bookkeeping entries) which can be multiplied by nine and earn
interest
for them - if only someone would be kind enough to borrow. It is money
waiting to be created.
The message is:
"Come on to the bank, folks. Don't be
bashful. We've got plenty of money to lend. You have credit you didn't even
know you had."
In the 1920s, the greater share of bank credit was bestowed
upon business
firms, wealthy investors, and other high rollers, but the little man was not
ignored.
In 1910, consumer credit accounted for only 10% of the nation's
retail sales. By 1929, credit transactions were responsible for half of the
$60 billion retail market.
In his Book, Money and Man, Elgin Groseclose
says:
"By 1929 the United States was overwhelmed by a flood of credit. It
had covered the land. It was pouring into every nook and cranny of the
national economy."
The impact of expanding credit was compounded by artificially low interest
rates - the other side of the same coin - which were intended to help the
governments of Europe.
But they also stimulated borrowing here at home.
Since borrowing is what causes money to be created under fractional-reserve
banking, the money supply in America began to expand. From 1921 through June
of 1929, the quantity of dollars increased by 61.8%, substantially more than
the increase in national product. During that same time, the amount of
currency in circulation remained virtually unchanged.
That means the
expansion was comprised entirely of money substitutes, such as bonds and
loan contracts.
BOOMS AND BUSTS MADE WORSE
The forces of the free market are amazingly flexible. Like the black market,
they manage to exert themselves in unexpected ways in spite of political
decree.
That had been the case throughout most of American history. Prior to
the creation of the Federal Reserve, banking had been coddled and hobbled by
government. Banks were chartered by government, protected by government, and
regulated by government.
They had been forced to serve the political agendas
of those in power. Consequently, the landscape was strewn with the
tombstones of dead banks which had taken to their graves the life savings of
their hapless depositors. But these were mostly regional tragedies that were
offset by growth and prosperity in other areas. Even within the communities
most severely affected, recovery was swift.
Now that the cartel had firm control over the nation's money supply, the
pattern began to change.
The corrective forces of the free market were more
firmly straight-jacketed than ever. All banks in the entire country were in
lock step with each other. What happened in one region is what happened in
all regions. Banks were not allowed to die, so there could be no adjustments
after their demise. Their illness was sustained and carried like a deadly
virus to the others.
The expansion of the money supply in the 1920s clearly shows that effect. It
was not a steady advance but a series of convulsions.
Each cycle was at a higher level than the previous one. That is because the
busts that followed the booms were not allowed to play themselves out. The
monetary scientists now had so many mechanisms at their command they were
able to initiate new expansions |o cancel out the downward adjustments. It
was like prescribing increasing doses of narcotics to postpone the awareness
of an advancing disease.
It increased the prestige of the doctor, but it did
not bode well for the patient.
THE ROLLER COASTER
Between 1920 and 1929, there were three distinct business cycles with
several minor ones within them. For the average American, it was confusing
and destructive.
For the investor, it was a roller-coaster ride to oblivion:
UP! The Fed had inflated the money supply to pay for World
War I. The resulting boom caused prices to rise.
DOWN! In 1920, the Fed
raised interest rates to cool off the inflation. That caused a recession,
and prices tumbled. Farmers were hit the hardest, and hundreds of country
banks were closed.
UP! In 1921, the Fed lowered interest rates to stop the
recession and to help the governments of Europe. Inflation and expanding
debt resulted.
DOWN! In 1923, the Fed tightened credit to put the brakes on
inflation
UP! But that was offset by its simultaneous policy of lowering the rate at
the discount window, thus encouraging banks to borrow new reserves to expand
the money supply.
UP! In 1924, the Fed suddenly created $500 million dollars
in new money. Within one year, the commercial banks parlayed that into more
than $4 billion, an expansion of eight-to-one. The boom that followed took
on the character of speculation rather than investment. Prices in the stock
market rose drastically.
DOWN! In 1926, the Florida land boom collapsed, and
the
economy began to contract once again.
UP! In 1927, Montagu Norman of the
Bank of England visited the United States to consult with Benjamin Strong.
Shortly after his visit, the Fed pumped new money into the system, and the
boom returned.
DOWN! In the spring of 1928, the Fed contracted credit to halt the boom.
UP! But the banks shifted their reserves into time deposits (where customers
agree to wait before withdrawing their money). Since time deposits require a
smaller reserve ratio than demand deposits, the banks were able to issue
more loans than before. That offset the Fed's contraction of credit.
UP! By that time, the British government had consumed its previous subsidy
which was used to maintain its welfare state. In the spring of 1928, the
pound sterling was again sagging on the international market, and gold began
to flow back into the United States. Once again, the fledgling Creature came
to the aid of the Bank of England, its ailing parent. The Fed bought a huge
volume of banker's acceptances to depress interest rates and halt the flow
of gold. The money supply suddenly increased by almost $2 billion.
DOWN! In August, the Fed reversed its expansionist policy by selling
Treasury bonds in the open market and raising interest rates. The money
supply began to contract.
It was the final bubble.
SIXTH REASON TO ABOLISH THE FED
One of the myths about the Federal Reserve is that it is needed to stabilize
the economy.
Yet, it has achieved just the opposite. Destabilization is
dramatically clear in the years prior to the Crash, but the same
cause-and-effect continues to this day. As long as men are given the power
to tinker with the money supply, they will strive to circumvent the natural
laws of supply and demand. No matter how high their intentions or pure their
motives, they will cause disruptions in the natural flow.
When these
disruptions are perceived, they will try to compensate by causing opposite
disruptions.
But, long before they act, there will already be new forces at
work which they cannot, in all their wisdom, perceive until they are already
manifest. It is the height of egotistical folly for "experts" to think they
can outsmart or do better than the combined, interactive decisions of
hundreds of millions of people all acting in response to their own best
judgment. Thus, the Fed is doomed to failure by its nature and its mission.
That is the sixth reason it should be abolished: It destabilizes the
economy.
TULIPOMANIA
Easy credit was not the only problem in this period. Equally Important was
the effect that had on the behavior patterns of the populace. Responding to
herd instinct and a belief in the possibility hf something-for-nothing, men
were driven to the most bizarre form of investment speculation.
This was not the first time such hysteria had seized a population. One of
the most graphic examples occurred in Holland between the years 1634 and
1636. It came to pass that a new, rare flower, called the tulip, was
discovered in the gardens of some of the more wealthy inhabitants of
Constantinople, now known as Istanbul.
When the root bulbs of these exotic
blossoms were brought into Holland, they rapidly became a status symbol
among the wealthy - much as race horses or rare breeds of dogs are today in
our own society - and those with surplus funds found that an investment in
tulips brought them significant social recognition.
The price of tulip bulbs climbed steadily until they became, not merely
symbols of status, but speculative investments as well. At one point,
prices doubled every few days, and speculators were Been everywhere amassing
great fortunes with no input of either labor or service.
Many otherwise prudent people found themselves
Infected by the hysteria. They borrowed against their homes and invested their life savings to get in on the
anticipated windfall. This bushed up prices even further and tended to
create the fulfillment of its own prophecy. Contracts for the future
delivery of tulip bulbs - a form of today's commodity market - became a
dominant feature of Holland's stock market.
Tulip bulbs eventually became more precious than gemstones. As new
varieties were developed, the market became more corn-Ilex, requiring
experts to certify their origin and their grade. Prices soared, and the herd
went insane. One bulb of the species called Admiral Liefken was valued at
4,400 florins; a Semper Augustus, worth 5,500 florins, was purchased for a
new carriage, two gray horses, and a complete set of harnesses.
It was
recorded that, at one tale, a single Viceroy brought two lasts of wheat,
four lasts of rye, lour fat oxen, eight fat swine, twelve fat sheep, two
hogsheads of mine, four casks of butter, one-thousand pounds of cheese, a
bed [and mattress, a suit of clothes, and a silver drinking cup.
Then, one day without warning, reality returned from her two-year vacation.
By that time, everyone knew deep in their hearts that the spiraling prices
bore no honest relationship to the value of the tulips and that, sooner or
later, someone was going to get hurt.
But they continued to speculate for
fear of being too quick in their timing and losing out on profits yet to
come. Everyone was confident they would sell out precisely at the top of the
market. In any herd, however, there are always a few who will take the lead
and, by 1636, all it took was one or two prominent merchants to sell out
their stock. Overnight, there were no buyers whatsoever, at any price.
The
tulip market vanished, and speculators by the thousands saw their dreams of
easy wealth - and, in many cases, their life savings also - disappear with
it. Tulipomania, as it was called at the time, had come to an end.
Or did it? As we have seen, the Federal Reserve can create large amounts of
money simply by going into the open market and buying debt contracts.
But,
once it is in the mainstream of the economy, commercial banks can multiply
that money by up to a factor of nine, and that is where the real
inflationary action is. To protect that privilege is one of the reasons the
banks formed this cartel in the first place. Nevertheless, the public still
has the final say. If no one wants to borrow their money, the game is over.
That possibility is more theoretical than real.
Although men may be hesitant
to go into debt for legitimate business ventures in times of economic
uncertainty, they can be lured by easy credit to take a long shot. Dreams of
instant wealth are powerful motivators. Gaming casinos, poker parlors, race
tracks, lottery windows, and other forms of tulipomania are convincing
evidence that the lust for gambling is embedded in genetic code.
The public
has always been interested in free corn.
TULIPS IN THE STOCK MARKET
During the final phase of America's credit expansion of the 1920s, the rise
in prices on the stock market was entirely speculative.
Buyers did not care
if their stocks were overpriced compared to the dividends they paid.
Commonly traded issues were selling for 20 to 50 times their earnings; some
traded at 100. Speculators acquired stock merely to hold for a while and
then sell at a profit. It was the "Greater-Fool" strategy. No matter how
high the price is today, there will be a greater fool tomorrow who will buy
at an even higher price. For a while, that strategy seemed to work.
To make the game even more exciting, it was common for Investors to purchase
their stocks on margin. That means the buyer buts up a small amount of money
as a deposit (the margin) and borrows the rest from his stockbroker - who
gets it from the bank, which gets it from the Fed. In the 1920s, the margin
for small Investors was as low as 10%.
Although the average stock yielded a modest 3% annual dividend, speculators were willing to pay over 1.2%
interest on their loans, meaning their stock had to appreciate about 9% per
year just to break even.
These margin accounts are sometimes referred to as "call loans" because the
broker has the right to "call them in" on very short Notice, often as short
as twenty-four hours. If the broker calls the loan, the investor must
produce the money immediately. If he cannot, the broker will obtain the
money by selling the stock. In theory, the sale of the stock will be
sufficient to cover the loan.
But, In practice, about the only time brokers
call their loans is when the market is tumbling.
Under those conditions,
the stock cannot be Bold except at a loss: a total loss of the investor's
margin; and a variable loss to the broker, depending on the severity of the
price tall. To obtain even more leverage, investors sometimes use the stocks
they already own as collateral for a margin loan on new stocks. Therefore,
if they cannot cover a margin call on their new stocks, they will lose their
old stocks as well.
In any event, such silly concerns were not in vogue in the 1920s, from
August of 1921 to September of 1929, the Dow-Jones industrial stock-price
average went from 63.9 to 381.17, a rise of 597%.
Credit was abundant, loans
were cheap, profits were big.
BANKS BECOME SPECULATORS
The commercial banks were the middlemen in this giddy game, by the end of
the decade, they were functioning more like speculators than banks.
Instead
of serving as dependable clearing louses for money, they also had become
players in the market. Loans to commercial enterprises for the production of
goods and services - which normally are the backbone of sound banking
practice - were losing ground to loans for speculating in the stock market
and in urban real estate.
Between 1921 and 1929, while commercial loans
remained constant, total bank loans increased from $24,121 million to
$35,711 million. Loans on securities and real estate rose nearly $8 billion.
Thus, about 70% of the increase during this period was in speculative
investments. And that money was created by the banks.
New York banks and trust companies had over $7 billion loaned to brokers at
the New York Stock Exchange for use in margin accounts. Before the war,
there were 250 securities dealers. By 1929, the number had grown to 6,500.
The banks not only generated the money for speculation, they became
speculators themselves by purchasing large blocks of high-yield bonds, many
of which were of dubious quality. Those were the kinds of securities that
are difficult to liquidate in a declining market. Borrowing money on short
term and investing on long term, the banks were maneuvering themselves into
a precarious position.
Did the Federal Reserve cause the speculation in the stock market? Of course
not. Speculators did that.
The Fed undoubtedly had other objects in mind,
but that did not cancel its responsibility. It was acutely aware of the
psychological effect of easy credit and had consciously used that knowledge
to manipulate public behavior on numerous occasions. Behavioral psychology
is a necessary tool of the trade. So it could claim neither ignorance nor
innocence.
In the unfolding of this tragedy, it was about as innocent as a
spider whose web "accidentally" caught the fly.
THE FINAL BUBBLE
In the Spring of 1928, the Federal Reserve expressed concern over
speculation in the stock market and raised interest rates to curb the
expansion of credit.
The growth in the money supply began to slow down, and
so did the rise in stock prices. It is conceivable that the soaring economy
could have been brought in for a "soft landing" - except that there were
other agendas to be considered. Professor Quigley had said that the central
bankers were not substantive powers unto themselves but were as marionettes
whose strings were pulled by others.
Just as the speculation spree appeared
to be coming under control, those strings were yanked, and the Federal
Reserve flip-flopped once again.
The strings originated in London. Even after seven years of subsidy by the
Federal Reserve, the British economy was sagging from the weight of its
socialist system, and gold was moving back into the United States.
The Fed,
in spite of its own public condemnation of excessive speculation, reversed
itself at the brink of success and purchased over $300 million of banker's
acceptances in the last half of 1928, which caused an increase in the money
supply of almost $2 billion.
Professor Rothbard says:
Europe, as we have noted, had found the benefits from the 1927 inflation
dissipated, and European opinion now clamored against any tighter money in
the U.S. The easing in late 1928 prevented gold inflows into the U.S. from
getting very large.
Great Britain was again losing gold, and sterling was
weak once more. The United States bowed once again to its overriding wish to
see Europe avoid the inevitable consequences of its own inflationary
policies.
Prior to the Fed's reversal of policy, stock prices had actually declined by
five per cent. Now, they went through the roof, rising twenty per cent from
July to December. The boom had returned in spades.
Then, in February of 1929, a curious event occurred.
Montagu
Norman travelled to the United States once again to confer
privately with the officers of the Federal Reserve. He also met with
Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury. There is no detailed
public record of what transpired at these closed meetings, but we
can be certain of three things: it was important; it concerned the
economies of America and Great Britain; and it was thought best
not to tell the public what was going on.
It is not unreasonable to
surmise that the central bankers had come to the conclusion that
the bubble - not only in America, but in Europe - was probably
going to rupture very soon. Rather than fight it, as they had in the
past, it was time to stand back and let it happen, clear out the
speculators, and return the markets to reality.
As Galbraith put it:
"How much better, as seen from the Federal Reserve, to let nature
2
take its course and thus allow nature to take the blame."
Mellon was even more emphatic. Herbert Hoover described Mellon's views as
follows:
Mr. Mellon had only one formula:
"liquidate labor, liquidate stocks,
liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate."
He insisted that, when the
people get an inflation brainstorm, the only way to get it out of their blood
is to let it collapse. He held that even a panic was not altogether a bad
thing.
He said:
"It will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs
of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a
moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up
the wrecks from less competent people." 1
If this had been the mindset between Mellon and Norman and the Federal
Reserve Board, the purpose of their meetings would have been to make sure
that, when the implosion happened, the central banks could coordinate their
policies. Rather than be overwhelmed by it, they should direct it as best
they can and turn it ultimately to their advantage.
Perhaps we shall never
know if that scenario is accurate, but the events that followed strongly
support such a view.
ADVANCE WARNING FOR MEMBERS ONLY
Immediately after the meetings, the monetary scientists began to issue
warnings to their colleagues in the financial fraternity to get out of the
market.
On February 6, the Federal Reserve issued an advisory to its member
banks to liquidate their holdings in the stock market. The following month,
Paul Warburg gave the same advice in the annual report to the stockholders
of his International Acceptance Bank.
He explained the reason for that
advice:
If the orgies of unrestrained speculation are permitted to spread, the
ultimate collapse is certain not only to affect the speculators themselves,
but to bring about a general depression involving the entire country.
Paul Warburg was a partner with Kuhn, Loeb & Co. which maintained a list of
preferred customers. These were fellow bankers, wealthy industrialists,
prominent politicians, and high officials in foreign governments. A similar
list was maintained at J.P.Morgan Co.
It was customary to Herbert Hoover described
Mellon's views e these men
advance notice on important stock issues and an opportunity to purchase them
at two to fifteen points below their price to the public. That was one of
the means by which investment bankers maintained influence over the affairs
of the world.
The men on these lists were notified of the coming crash.
-
John D. Rockefeller
-
J.P. Morgan
-
Joseph P. Kennedy
-
Bernard Baruch
-
Henry Morganthau
-
Douglas Dillon,
...the biographies of all the Wall Street giants
at that time boast that these men were "wise" enough to get out of the stock
market just before the Crash. And it is true.
Virtually all of the inner
club was rescued. There is no record of any member of the interlocking
directorate between the Federal Reserve, the major New York banks, and their
prime customers having been caught by surprise.
Wisdom, apparently, was
greatly affected by whose list one was on.
A MESSAGE OF COMFORT TO THE PUBLIC
While the crew was abandoning ship, the passengers were told it was a lovely
cruise.
President Coolidge and Treasury Secretary Mellon had been vociferous
in their public utterances that the economy was in better shape than ever.
From his socialist perch in London, John Maynard Keynes exclaimed that the
management of the dollar by the Federal Reserve Board was a "triumph" of man
fever money.
And, from the plush offices of his New York
Federal Reserve Bank, Benjamin Strong boasted:
The very existence of the Federal Reserve
System is a safeguard against anything like a calamity growing out of
money rates... In former days the psychology was different, because the
facts of the banking situation were different. Mob panic, and
consequently mob disaster, is less likely to arise.
The public was comforted, and the balloon
continued to expand. It was now time to sharpen the pin.
On April 19, the Fed field an emergency meeting
under cloak of great secrecy. The following day, the New York Times reported
as follows:
RESERVE COUNCIL CONFERS IN HASTE
Atmosphere of Mystery Is Thrown about Its
Meeting in Washington
An atmosphere of deep mystery was thrown about the proceedings both by
the board and the council.
No advance announcement had been made that
an extraordinary session of the council was contemplated, and the fact
that the members were in the city became known only when newspaper
correspondents happened to see some of them entering the Treasury
Department building. Even after that, evasive replies were given...
While the joint meeting was in progress at
the Treasury Department, every effort was made to guard the proceedings,
and a group of newspaper correspondents were asked to leave the
corridor.
Let us return briefly to Montagu Norman.
His biographer tells us that, after he became
head of the Bank of England, his custom was to journey to the United States
several times each year, although his arrival was seldom noted by the press.
He travelled in disguise, wearing a long, black cloak and a large,
broad-brimmed hat, and he used the pseudonym of Professor Skinner.
It was on one of those unpublicized trips that
he ran into a young Australian by the name of W.C. Wentworth.
Sixty years
later, Wentworth wrote a letter to The Australian, a newspaper in Sydney,
and told of his encounter:
In 1929 I was a member of the Oxford and
Cambridge athletic team, visiting America to run against American
Universities. Late in July we split up to return, and I, together with
some other members, boarded a smallish passenger vessel in New York.
(There were, of course, no airplanes in those days.)
A fellow passenger was "Mr. Skinner," and a
member of our team recognized him. He was Montagu Norman, returning to
London, after a secret visit to the US Central Bank, travelling incognito.
When we told him we knew who he was, he asked us not to blow his cover,
because if the details of his movement were made public, it could have
serious financial consequences. Naturally, we agreed, and on the days
following, as we crossed the Atlantic, he talked to us very frankly.
He said,
"In the next few months there is going to be
a shake-out But don't worry - it won't last for long."
On August 9, just a few weeks after that
ship-board encounter, the Federal Reserve Board reversed its easy-credit
policy and raised the discount rate to six per cent.
A few days later, the Bank of England raised its
rate also. Bank reserves in both countries began to shrink and, along with
them, so did the money supply. Simultaneously, the System began to sell
securities in the open market, a maneuver that also contracts the money
supply.
Call rates on margin loans had jumped to fifteen, then twenty per
cent The pin I had been inserted.
THE DUCK DINNER BEGINS
The securities market reached its high point on September 19. Then, it began
to slide. The public was not yet aware that the end had arrived.
The roller
coaster had dipped before. Surely it would shoot upward again. For five more
weeks, the public bought heavily on the way down. More than a million shares
were traded during that period. Then, on Thursday, October 24, like a giant
school of fish suddenly turning direction in response to an unseen signal,
thousands of investors stampeded to sell.
The ticker tape was hopelessly
overloaded. Prices tumbled. Thirteen million shares exchanged hands.
Everyone said the bottom had dropped out of the market. They were wrong. Five days later, it did.
On Tuesday, October 29, the exchanges were crushed by an I avalanche of
selling. At times there were no buyers at all. By the end of the trading
session, over sixteen million shares had been dumped, in most cases at any
price that was offered. Within a single day, millions of investors were
wiped out. Within a few weeks of further decline, $3 billion of wealth had
disappeared.
Within twelve months, $40 billion had vanished. People who had
counted their paper profits and thought they were rich suddenly found
themselves to be very poor.
The other side of the coin is that, for every seller, there was a buyer. The
insiders who had moved their investments into cash and gold were the buyers.
It must be remembered that falling stock prices didn't necessarily mean that
there was anything wrong with the stocks. Those representing solid companies
were still paying dividends and were good investments - at a realistic
price.
In the panic, prices had tumbled far below their natural levels.
Those who had the cash picked them up for a small fraction of their true
worth. Giant holding companies were formed for that task, such as Marine
Midland Corporation, the Lehman Corporation, and the Equity Corporation.
J.P. Morgan set up the food trust called Standard Brands. Like the shark
swallowing the mackerel, the big speculators devoured the small.
There is no evidence that the Crash was planned for the purpose of profit
taking.
In fact, there is much to show that the monetary scientists tried
mightily to avert it, and might have done so had not their higher-priority
agendas gotten in the way. Yet, once they realized the inevitability of a
collapse in the market, they were not bashful about using their privileged
position to take full advantage of it.
In that sense, FDR's son-in-law,
Curtis Dall, was right when he wrote,
"It was the calculated 'shearing' of
the public by the World Money Powers."
NATURAL LAW NO. 5
Here is another of those "natural laws" of economics that needs
to be added to our list:
LESSON: It is human nature for man to place personal priorities ahead of all
others. Even the best of men cannot long resist the temptation to benefit at
the expense of their neighbors if the occasion is placed squarely before
them.
This is especially true when the means by which they benefit is
obscure and not likely to be perceived as such. There may be exceptional men
from time to time who can resist that temptation, but their numbers are
small. The general rule will prevail in the long run.
A managed economy presents men with precisely that kind of opportunity. The
power to create and extinguish the nation's money supply provides unlimited
potential for personal gain Throughout history the granting of that power
has been justified as being necessary to protect the public, but the results
have always been the opposite. It has been used against the public and for
the personal gain of those who control. Therefore,
LAW: When men are entrusted with the power to control the money supply, they
will eventually use that power to confiscate the wealth of their neighbors.
There is no better illustration of that law than the Crash of 1929 and the
lingering depression that followed.
FROM CRASH TO DEPRESSION
The lingering depression is an important part of the story.
The Speculators
had been ruined, but what they lost was money acquired without effort. There
were some unfortunate souls who also lost their life savings, but only
because they gambled those savings on call loans. Those who bought stock
with money they actually possessed did not have to sell, and they did quite
well in the long run.
For the most part, something-for-nothing had merely
been converted back into nothing. The price of stocks had plummeted, but the
companies behind them were still producing products, still employing people,
and still paying dividends. No one lost his job just because the market
fell. The tulips were gone, but the wheat crop remained.
So, where was the problem? In truth, there was none - at least mot yet.
The
crash, as devastating as it was to the speculators, had little effect on the
average American. Unemployment didn't become rampant until the depression
years which came later and were caused by continued government restraint of
the free market, the drop of prices in the stock market was really a
long-overdue and healthy adjustment to the economy.
The stage was now set
for recovery and sound economic growth, as always had happened in the past.
It did not happen this time. The monetary and political dentists who had
created the problem now were in full charge of the rescue. They saw the
crash as a golden opportunity to justify even more controls than before.
Herbert Hoover launched a multitude of government programs to bolster wage
rates, prevent prices from dropping, prop up failing firms, stimulate
construction, guarantee home loans, protect the depositors, rescue the
banks, subsidize the farmers, and provide public works. FDR was swept into
office by promising even more of the same under the slogan of a New Deal.
And the Federal Reserve launched a series of "banking reforms," all of which
were measures to further extend its power over the money supply.
In 1931, fresh money was pumped into the economy to restart the cycle, but
this time the rocket would not lift off. The dead weight of new
bureaucracies and government regulations and subsidies and taxes and welfare
benefits and deficit spending and tinkering with prices had kept it on the
launching pad.
Eventually, the productive foundation of the country also began to crumble
under the weight Taxes and regulatory agencies forced companies out of
business. Those that remained had to curtail production.
Unemployment began
to spread.
By every economic measure, the economy was no better or worse in
1939 than it was in 1930 when the rescue began.
It wasn't until the outbreak
of World War II, and the tooling up for war production that followed, that
the depression was finally brought to an end.
It was a dubious save. In almost every way, it was a repeat of the drama
played out with World War I, even to the names of two of its most important
players.
FDR and Churchill worked together behind the scenes to bring
America into the conflict - Churchill wanting American assistance in a war
England was losing and could not afford, FDR wanting a jolt to the economy
for political reasons, and the financiers, gathered behind J.P. Morgan,
wanting the profits of war. But that is another chapter, and this book is
long enough.
What happened after World War II was the focus of the first six chapters.
That brings us to the end of historical record. It's time, now, to reset the
coordinates on our time machine and return to the present.
SUMMARY
Congress had been assured that the Federal Reserve Act would decentralize
banking power away from Wall Street.
However, within a few years of its
inception, the System was controlled by the New York Reserve Bank under the
leadership of Benjamin Strong whose name was synonymous with the Wall Street
money trust.
During the nine years before the crash of 1929, the Federal Reserve was
responsible for a massive expansion of the money supply. A primary motive
for that policy was to assist the government of Great Britain to pay for its
socialist programs which, by then, had drained its treasury.
By devaluing
the dollar and depressing interest rates in America, investors would move
their money to England where rates and values were higher. That strategy
succeeded in helping Great Britain for a while, but it set in motion the
forces that made the stock-market crash inevitable.
The money supply expanded throughout this period, but the trend was
interspersed with short spasms of contraction which were the result of
attempts to halt the expansions. Each resolve to use restraint was broken by
the higher political agenda of helping the governments of Europe. In the
long view, the result of plentiful money and easy credit was a wave of
speculation in the stock market and urban real estate that intensified with
each passing month.
There is circumstantial evidence that the Bank of England and the Federal
Reserve had concluded, at a secret meeting in February of 1929, that a
collapse in the market was inevitable and that the best action was to let
nature take its course. Immediately after that meeting, the financiers sent
advisory warnings to lists of preferred customers - wealthy industrialists,
prominent politicians, and high officials in foreign governments - to get
out of the stock market. Meanwhile, the American people were being assured
that the economy was in sound condition.
On August 9, the Federal Reserve applied the pin to the bubble. It increased
the bank-loan rate and began to sell securities in the open market. Both
actions have the effect of reducing the money supply.
Rates on brokers'
loans jumped to 20%.
On October 29, the stock market collapsed. Thousands of
investors were wiped out in a single day. The insiders who were forewarned
had converted their stocks into cash while prices were still high. They now
became the buyers.
Some of the greatest fortunes in America were made in
that fashion.
