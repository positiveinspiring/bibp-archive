For the first time in Greece a documentary produced by the audience.
Debtocracy seeks the causes of the debt crisis and proposes solutions,
hidden by the government and the dominant media.
Debtocracy is a 2011 documentary film by Katerina Kitidi and
Aris Hatzistefanou.
The documentary mainly focuses on two points:
Aris Hatzistefanou, 34, is accustomed to uncomfortable reporting.
A
journalist since his teens, his long-running show Infowar on Sky Radio
was canceled just as his thought-provoking documentary, Debtocracy,
was released.
From the authors
The idea came about during a Sky Radio show on
how the Ecuadorian president was responding to the countrys massive debt.
He started a simple financial audit of sovereign
debt, and came to the conclusion that other countries were using Ecuador as
a slave, like Argentina and many other countries before. The administration
forced a haircut of 70% on its creditors.
Katerina Kitidi - editor in chief of TV XS - and I decided to produce the
documentary.
We faced a serious funding problem but, for
obvious reasons, we didnt want to ask any political parties, companies or -
even worse - banks, so we resorted to crowd-funding.
It worked very well, we collected 8,000 Euros in just 10 days, an
unprecedented figure for a country like Greece, facing a serious economic
crisis.
At the beginning this project was supposed to be a mere YouTube video. But
because so many professionals offered their help (musicians, video editors),
and so many people donated their money, it became a real documentary.
The surplus was invested in promoting the movie.
