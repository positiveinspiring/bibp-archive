Weve entered an exciting transformative period in which the role of money
in our society is being reconsidered.
Did you know for instance that all
over the world alternative currencies are popping up? No? Well, buckle up
then!
Money is essentially created to overcome the limitations of reciprocal trade
by creating a quantitative ecosystem that makes exchange and value storage
more flexible.
But our current monetary system comes with some downfalls as
well, which have become ever so apparent in our current time frame.
Some issues around money
Money promotes hoarding:
For instance, 90 now is worth 100 in a years
time at an interest rate of 11% (I know, I know, approximately...)
So it
promotes todays hoarding of money instead of investing it in sustainable
productive resources. Demurrage, which is instigating a negative interest
rate is an instrument to promote the latter.
Money doesnt bare true value: the true value in a transaction between you
and a baker is the bread thats baked. We tend to ascribe value to money,
where in fact it doesnt have any unless it is backed by an asset or
commodity (which in fact often isnt the case).
Money drives immoral decision making:
Money is an abstract figure.
Accumulate billions of them and our brains lose sight of the reality behind
that figure.
Take for instance the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008; our
bankers cut up spreadsheet numbers into risk-assigned variables and resold
them into packages to a party willing to take the higher risk-return rate.
Not one of them considered the idea of the potential disastrous effects a
moral appeal.
After all, theyre just numbers, right?
Money alienates us from each other:
money has a tendency to render every
interaction into a transaction.
On top of that, the system of interest
redemption and payment drives people into competition for their share of the
pie.
The rise of alternative currencies
Acknowledging these downfalls of our current monetary system, some
alternatives arise.
These so-called complementary currencies are designed to
encourage investing in productive assets rather than hoarding. On top of
that, they encourage (local) trade and cooperation and are less susceptible
to inflation because they are backed by an external reference such as a
commodity or service rather than the fiat of a central authority. They come
in various colors and flavors, some of which well explore below.
Time Banking, also known as services exchange or
Time Trade, is backed by
hours of work delivered.
It is nowadays primarily used by communities to
provide and incentive for work such as teaching children, helping the
elderly or just what we used to refer to a being neighborly. But it has its
social goal as well.
By participating you gain credits for your time
invested, gain the opportunity to meet others, confidence and on top of
that, it gives a sense of meaning to life. So it builds social capital
within a community.
Timebanking is applied
within communities all over the
world.
Some examples?
-
Caire (Dutch)
-
Ithaca Hours (US)
-
Timebanks USA
-
TimeBanking UK
Another alternative currency is for example Regiogeld in Germany. Basically,
this is a alternative currency backed by the national currency with the goal
of promoting local trade in the community.
Now, some electronic currencies are evolving as well, such as Bit Coin,
their main advantages being that there is a fixed quantity (just like metal,
gold) and no one has the ability to create new bitcoins, theres no interest
so it promotes investment in sustainable assets and theres no need for a
central authority.
The world is going free
anyway: peer-to-peer
Enabled by peer to peer advances online, we have a decreasing necessity for
large corporations.
In times of insecurity, we tend to seek security and
progress in each other. We can slowly see how the world is going free, as
millions of us around the world are freely giving and sharing places to stay
over, music, skills, knowledge & compassion. It all stems from the natural
urge of everything in our universe to want to be free.
Complementary currency systems such as time banks are the next step in
evolution towards a world that revolves around unconditional giving. Slowly
but steadily, we getting there.
Giving is All we Have doesnt stand still
either and is currently participating in a ground-breaking initiative to
fuel that evolution, of which Im sure you will hear more within a year.
Sorry guys, Im dying to tell you more. But be patient.
Meanwhile, find some
more inspiration here!
