# The Violence of Organized Forgetting

Since the late1970s, there has been an
intensification in the United States, Canada and Europe of
neoliberal modes of governance, ideology and policies - a historical
period in which the foundations for democratic public spheres have
been dismantled.
Schools,
public radio, the media and other
critical cultural apparatuses have been under siege, viewed as
dangerous to a market-driven society that considers critical
thought, dialogue, and civic engagement a threat to its basic
values, ideologies, and structures of power.
This was the beginning of an historical
era in which the discourse of democracy, public values, and the
common good came crashing to the ground.
Margaret Thatcher in Britain and
soon after Ronald Reagan in the United States - both
hard-line advocates of market fundamentalism - announced that there
was no such thing as society and that government was the problem not
the solution.
Democracy and the political process were
all but sacrificed to the power of corporations and the emerging
financial service industries, just as hope was appropriated as an
advertisement for the whitewashed world, a culture whose capacity to
critique oppressive social practices was greatly diminished. Large
social movements fragmented into isolated pockets of resistance
mostly organized around a form of identity politics that largely
ignored a much-needed conversation about the attack on the social
and the broader issues affecting society such as the growing
inequality in wealth, power and income.
What is particularly new is the way in
which young people have been increasingly denied a significant place
in an already weakened social contract and the degree to which they
are absent from how many countries now define the future. Youth are
no longer the place where society reveals its dreams.
Instead, youth are becoming the site of
society's nightmares. Within neoliberal narratives, youth are mostly
defined as a consumer market, a drain on the economy, or stand for
trouble.[4]
Young people increasingly have become
subject to an oppressive disciplinary machine that teaches them to
define citizenship through the exchange practices of the market and
to follow orders and toe the line in the face of oppressive forms of
authority. They are caught in a society in which almost every aspect
of their lives is shaped by the dual forces of the market and a
growing police state.
The message is clear: Buy/ sell/ or be
punished.
Mostly out of step, young people,
especially poor minorities and low-income whites, are increasingly
inscribed within a machinery of dead knowledge, social relations and
values in which there is an attempt to render them voiceless and
invisible.
How young people are represented
betrays a great deal about what is increasingly new about the
economic, social, cultural and political constitution of American
society and its growing disinvestment in young people, the social
state and democracy itself.[5]
The structures of neoliberal violence
have put the vocabulary of democracy on life support, and one
consequence is that subjectivity and education are no longer the
lifelines of critical forms of individual and social agency.
The promises of modernity regarding
progress, freedom and hope have not been eliminated; they have been
reconfigured, stripped of their emancipatory potential and relegated
to the logic of a savage market instrumentality. Modernity has
reneged on its promise to young people to provide social mobility,
stability and collective security.
Long-term planning and the institutional
structures that support them are now relegated to the imperatives of
privatization, deregulation, flexibility and short-term profits.
Social bonds have given way under the collapse of social protections
and the attack on the welfare state.
Moreover, all solutions to socially
produced problems are now relegated to the mantra of individual
solutions.[6]
Public problems collapse into the
limited and depoliticized register of private issues. Individual
interests now trump any consideration of the good of society just as
all problems are ultimately laid at the door of the solitary
individual, whose fate is shaped by forces far beyond his or her
capacity for personal responsibility.
Under neoliberalism everyone has to
negotiate their fate alone, bearing full responsibility for problems
that are often not of their own doing.
The implications politically,
economically and socially for young people are disastrous and are
contributing to the emergence of a generation of young people who
will occupy a space of social abandonment and terminal exclusion.
Job insecurity, debt servitude, poverty, incarceration and a growing
network of real and symbolic violence have entrapped too many young
people in a future that portends zero opportunities and zero hopes.
This is a generation that has become the
new register for disposability, redundancy, and new levels of
surveillance and control.
The severity and consequences of this
shift in modernity under neoliberalism among youth is evident in the
fact that this is the first generation in which the,
"plight of the outcast may stretch
to embrace a whole generation."[7]
Zygmunt Bauman argues that
today's youth have been,
"cast in a condition of liminal
drift, with no way of knowing whether it is transitory or
permanent."[8]
That is, the generation of youth in the
early 21st century has no way of grasping if they will
ever,
"be free from the gnawing sense of
the transience, indefiniteness, and provisional nature of any
settlement."[9]
Neoliberal violence produced in part
through a massive shift in wealth to the upper 1%, growing
inequality, the reign of the financial service industries, the
closing down of educational opportunities, and the stripping of
social protections from those marginalized by race and class has
produced a generation without jobs, an independent life and even the
most minimal social benefits.
Youth no longer inhabit the
privileged space, however compromised, that was offered to previous
generations.
They now occupy a neoliberal notion of
temporality of dead time and zones of abandonment and terminal
exclusion marked by a loss of faith in progress and a belief in
those apocalyptic narratives in which the future appears
indeterminate, bleak and insecure.
Progressive visions pale and are smashed
next to the normalization of market-driven government policies that
wipe out pensions, eliminate quality health care, punish unions,
demonize public servants, raise college tuition, and produce a harsh
world of joblessness - all the while giving billions and,
"huge bonuses, instead of prison
sentences... to those bankers and investment brokers who were
responsible for the 2008 meltdown of the economy and the loss of
homes for millions of Americans."[10]
Students, in particular, now find
themselves in a world in which heightened expectations have been
replaced by dashed hopes.
The promises of higher education and
previously enviable credentials have turned into the swindle of
fulfillment as,
"For the first time in living
memory, the whole class of graduates faces a future of crushing
debt, and a high probability, almost the certainty, of ad hoc,
temporary, insecure and part-time work and unpaid 'trainee'
pseudo-jobs deceitfully rebranded as 'practices' - all
considerably below the skills they have acquired and eons below
the level of their expectations." [11]
What has changed about an entire
generation of young people includes not only neoliberal society's
disinvestment in youth and the lasting fate of downward mobility,
but also the fact that youth live in a commercially carpet-bombed
and commodified environment that is unlike anything experienced by
those of previous generations.
Nothing has prepared this generation for
the inhospitable and savage new world of,
-
commodification
-
privatization
-
joblessness
-
frustrated hopes
-
stillborn projects [12]
Commercials provide the primary content
for their dreams, relations to others, identities and sense of
agency.
There appears to be no space outside the
panoptican of commercial barbarism and casino capitalism. The
present generation has been born into a throwaway society of
consumers in which both goods and young people are increasingly
objectified and disposable.
Young people now reside in a world in
which there are few public spheres or social spaces autonomous from
the reach of the market, warfare state, debtfare, and sprawling
tentacles of what is ominously called the Department of Homeland
Security.
The structures of neoliberal
modernity do more than disinvest in young people and commodify them,
they also transform the protected space of childhood into a zone of
disciplinary exclusion and cruelty, especially for those young
people further marginalized by race and class who now inhabit a
social landscape in which they are increasingly disparaged as flawed
consumers or pathologized others.
With no adequate role to play as
consumers, many youth are now considered disposable, forced to
inhabit "zones of social abandonment" extending from homeless
shelters and bad schools to bulging detention centers and prisons.[13]
In the midst of the rise of the
punishing state, the circuits of state repression, surveillance, and
disposability increasingly,
"link the fate of blacks, Latinos,
Native Americans, poor whites, and Asian Americans".
...who are now caught in a
governing-through-crime-youth complex, which increasingly serves as
a default solution to major social problems.[14]
As Michael Hart and Antonio
Negri point out, young people live in a society in which every
institution becomes an "inspection regime" - recording, watching,
gathering information and storing data.[15]
Complementing these regimes is the
shadow of the prison, which is no longer separated from society as
an institution of total surveillance.
Instead,
"total surveillance is increasingly
the general condition of society as a whole. 'The prison',"
Michel Foucault notes, "begins well before its doors. It begins
as soon as you leave your house - and even before." [16]
Everyone is Now
a Potential Terrorist
At the start of the second decade of the
21st century, young people all over the world are
demonstrating against a variety of issues ranging from economic
injustice and massive inequality to drastic cuts in education and
public services.
These demonstrations have and currently
are being met with state-sanctioned violence and an almost
pathological refusal to hear their demands. More specifically, in
the United States the state monopoly on the use of violence has
intensified since the 1980s, and in the process, has been
increasingly directed against young people, low-income whites, poor
minorities, immigrants, and women.
As the welfare state is hollowed out, a
culture of compassion is replaced by a culture of violence, cruelty
and disposability.
Collective insurance policies and social
protections have given way to the forces of economic deregulation,
the transformation of the welfare state into punitive workfare
programs, the privatization of public goods and an appeal to
individual accountability as a substitute for social responsibility.
Under the notion that unregulated
market-driven values and relations should shape every domain of
human life, the business model of governance has eviscerated any
viable notion of social responsibility while furthering the
criminalization of social problems and cutbacks in basic social
services, especially for the poor, young people and the elderly.[17]
Within the existing neoliberal
historical conjuncture, there is a merging of violence and
governance and the systemic disinvestment in and breakdown of
institutions and public spheres that have provided the minimal
conditions for democracy.
This becomes obvious in the emergence of
a surveillance state in which the social media not only become new
platforms for the invasion of privacy, but further legitimate a
culture in which monitoring functions are viewed as benign while the
state-sponsored society of hyper-fear increasingly defines everyone
as either a snitch or a terrorist.
Everyone, especially minorities of race
and ethnicity, now live under a surveillance panoptican in which,
"living under constant surveillance
means living as criminals."[18]
As young people make diverse claims on
the promise of a radical democracy, articulating what a fair and
just world might be, they are increasingly met with forms of
physical, ideological and structural violence.
Abandoned by the existing political
system, young people in Oakland, California, New York City, Quebec
and numerous other cities throughout the globe have placed their
bodies on the line, protesting peacefully while trying to produce a
new language, politics, imagine long-term institutions, and support
notions of,
"community that manifest the values
of equality and mutual respect that they see missing in a world
that is structured by neoliberal principles."[19]
In Quebec, in spite of police violence
and threats, thousands of students demonstrated for months against a
former right-wing government that wanted to raise tuition and cut
social protections.
These demonstrations are continuing in a
variety of countries throughout the globe and embrace an investment
in a new understanding of the commons as a shared space of
knowledge, debate, exchange and participation.
Such movements, however diverse, are not
simply about addressing current injustices and reclaiming space but
also about producing new ideas, generating a new conversation and
introducing a new political language. Rejecting the notion that
democracy and markets are the same, young people are calling for an
end to the poverty, grotesque levels of economic inequality, the
suppression of dissent and the permanent war state.
They refuse to be defined exclusively as
consumers rather than as workers, and they reject the notion that
the only interests that matter are monetary.
They also oppose those market-driven
values and practices aimed at both creating radically individualized
subjects and undermining those public spheres that create bonds of
solidarity that reinforce a commitment to the common good.
And these movements all refuse the
notion that financialization defines the only acceptable definition
of exchange, one that is based exclusively on the reductionist
notion of buying and selling.
Resistance and
the Politics of the Historical Conjuncture
Marginalized youth, workers, artists and
others are raising serious questions about the violence of
inequality and the social order that legitimates it.
They are calling for a redistribution of
wealth and power - not within the old system, but in a new one in
which democracy becomes more than a slogan or a legitimation for
authoritarianism and state violence.
As Stanley Aronowitz and
Angela Davis, among others, have argued, the fight for education
and justice is inseparable from the struggle for economic equality,
human dignity and security, and the challenge of developing American
institutions along genuinely democratic lines.[20]
Today, there is a new focus on public
values, the need for broad-based movements for solidarity, and
alternative conceptions of politics, democracy and justice.
All of these issues are important, but
what must be addressed in the most immediate sense is the threat
that the emerging police state in the United States poses not to
just the young protesters occupying a number of American cities, but
also the threat it poses to democracy itself.
This threat is being exacerbated as a
result of the merging of a war-like mentality and neoliberal mode of
discipline and education in which it becomes difficult to reclaim
the language of obligation, social responsibility and civic
engagement.[21]
Everywhere we look we see the
encroaching shadow of the police state. The government now
requisitions the publics' telephone records and sifts through its
emails.
It labels whistle-blowers such as
Edward Snowden as traitors,
even though they have exposed the corruption, lawlessness and host
of antidemocratic practices engaged in by established governments.
Police can take DNA samples of all people arrested of a crime,
whether they are proven guilty or not.
The United States is incarcerating
people in record numbers, imprisoning over 2.3 million inmates
while,
"6 million people at any one time
[are] under carceral supervision - more than were in Stalin's
Gulag."[22]
While there has been considerable
coverage in the progressive media given to the violence that was
waged against the Occupy movement and other protesters, I
want to build on these analyses by arguing that it is important to
situate such violence within a broader set of categories that
enables a critical understanding of not only the underlying social,
economic and political forces at work in such assaults, but also
allows us to reflect critically on the distinctiveness of the
current historical period in which they are taking place.
For example, it is difficult to address
such state-sponsored violence against young people without analyzing
the devolution of the social state and the corresponding rise of the
warfare and punishing state.
Stuart Hall's reworking of
Gramsci's notion of conjuncture is important here because it
provides both an opening into the forces shaping a particular
historical moment while allowing for a merging of theory and
strategy.[23]
Conjuncture in this case refers to a
period in which different elements of society come together to
produce a unique fusion of the economic, social, political,
ideological and cultural in a relative settlement that becomes
hegemonic in defining reality.
That ruptural unity is today marked by a
neoliberal conjuncture. In this particular historical moment, the
notion of conjuncture helps us to address theoretically how youth
protests are largely related to a historically specific neoliberal
project that promotes vast inequalities in income and wealth,
creates the student-loan-debt bomb, eliminates much-needed social
programs, eviscerates the social wage, and privileges profits and
commodities over people.
Within the United States especially, the
often violent response to nonviolent forms of youth protests must
also be analyzed within the framework of a mammoth
military-industrial state and its commitment to war and the
militarization of the entire society.[24]
The merging of the military-industrial
complex, surveillance state and unbridled corporate power points to
the need for strategies that address what is specific about the
current warfare and surveillance state and the neoliberal project
and how different interests, modes of power, social relations,
public pedagogies and economic configurations come together to shape
its politics.
Such a conjuncture is invaluable
politically in that it provides a theoretical opening for making the
practices of the warfare state and the neoliberal revolution visible
in order,
"to give the resistance to its
onward march, content, focus and a cutting edge."[25]
It also points to the conceptual power
of making clear that history remains an open horizon that cannot be
dismissed through appeals to the end of history or end of ideology.[26]
It is precisely through the
indeterminate nature of history that resistance becomes possible and
politics refuses any guarantees and remains open.
I want to argue that the current
historical moment or what Stuart Hall calls the "long march of the
Neoliberal Revolution," [27] has to be understood
in terms of the growing forms of violence that it deploys and
reinforces.
Such antidemocratic pressures and their
relationship to the rising protests of young people in the United
States and abroad are evident in the crisis that has emerged through
the merging of governance and violence, the growth of the punishing
state, and the persistent development of what has been described by
Alex Honneth as "a failed sociality."[28]
The United States has become addicted to
violence, and this dependency is fueled increasingly by its
willingness to wage war at home and abroad.
War in this instance is not merely the
outgrowth of polices designed to protect the security and well-being
of the United States. It is also, as C. Wright Mills pointed
out, part of a "military metaphysics" - a complex of forces that
includes,
-
corporations
-
defense industries
-
politicians
-
financial institutions
-
universities [29]
War provides jobs, profits, political
payoffs, research funds, and forms of political and economic power
that reach into every aspect of society. War is also one of the
nation's most honored virtues, and its militaristic values now bear
down on almost every aspect of American life.[30]
As modern society is formed against the
backdrop of a permanent war zone, a carceral state and
hyper-militarism, the social stature of the military and soldiers
has risen.
As Michael Hardt and Tony
Negri have pointed out,
"In the United States, rising esteem
for the military in uniform corresponds to the growing
militarization of the society as a whole.
All of this despite repeated
revelations of the illegality and immorality of the military's
own incarceration systems, from Guantanamo to Abu Ghraib, whose
systematic practices border on if not actually constitute
torture."[31]
The state of exception in the United
States, in particular, has become permanent and promises no end.
War has become a mode of sovereignty and rule,
eroding the distinction between war and peace. Increasingly fed by a
moral and political hysteria, warlike values produce and endorse
shared fears as the primary register of social relations.
The
war on terror, rebranded under
Obama as the "Overseas Contingency Operation," has
morphed into war on democracy.
Everyone is now considered a potential
terrorist, providing a rational for both the government and private
corporations to spy on anybody, regardless of whether they have
committed a crime. Surveillance is supplemented by a growing
domestic army of baton-wielding police forces who are now being
supplied with the latest military equipment.
Military technologies such as Drones,
SWAT vehicles and machine-gun-equipped armored trucks once used
exclusively in high-intensity war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan
are now being supplied to police departments across the nation and
not surprisingly,
"the increase in such weapons is
matched by training local police in war zone tactics and
strategies."[32]
The domestic war against
"terrorists" [code for young protesters] provides new opportunities
for major defense contractors and corporations who,
"are becoming more a part of our
domestic lives."[33]
As Glenn Greenwald points
out,
"Arming domestic police forces with
paramilitary weaponry will ensure their systematic use even in
the absence of a terrorist attack on US soil; they will simply
find other, increasingly permissive uses for those weapons."
[34]
Of course, the new domestic paramilitary
forces will also undermine free speech and dissent with the threat
of force while simultaneously threatening core civil liberties,
rights and civic responsibilities.
Given that,
"by age 23, almost a third of
Americans are arrested for a crime,"
...it becomes clear that in the new
militarized state young people, especially poor minorities, are
viewed as predators, a threat to corporate governance, and are
treated as disposable populations.[35]
This siege mentality will be reinforced
by the merging of private and corporate intelligence and
surveillance agencies, and the violence it produces will increase as
will the growth of a punishment state that acts with impunity.
Too much of this violence is reminiscent
of the violence used against civil rights demonstrators by the
forces of Jim Crow in the 1950s and 1960s.[36]
Yet, there is more at work here
than the prevalence of armed knowledge and a militarized discourse,
there is also the emergence of a militarized society that now
organizes itself "for the production of violence."[37]
A society in which,
"the range of acceptable opinion
inevitably shrinks."[38]
But the prevailing move in American
society to a permanent war status does more than promote a set of
unifying symbols that embrace a survival of the fittest ethic,
promoting conformity over dissent, the strong over the weak, and
fear over responsibility, it also gives rise to what David
Graeber has called a "language of command" in which violence
becomes the most important element of power and mediating force in
shaping social relationships.[39]
Permanent War
and the Public Pedagogy of Hyper-Violence
As a mode of public pedagogy, a state of
permanent war needs willing subjects to abide by its values,
ideology, and narratives of fear and violence.
Such legitimation is largely provided
through a market-driven culture addicted to the production of
consumerism, militarism and organized violence, largely circulated
through various registers of popular culture that extend from high
fashion and Hollywood movies to the creation of violent video games
and music concerts sponsored by the Pentagon.
The market-driven spectacle of war
demands a culture of conformity, quiet intellectuals and a largely
passive republic of consumers. There is also a need for subjects who
find intense pleasure in commodification of violence and a culture
of cruelty.
Under neoliberalism, culture appears to
have largely abandoned its role as a site of critique. Very little
appears to escape the infantilizing and moral vacuity of the market.
For instance, the architecture of war
and violence is now matched by a barrage of goods parading as
fashion.
For instance, in light of the recent
NSA and PRISM spying revelations in
the United States, The New York Times ran a story on a new line of
fashion with the byline:
"Stealth Wear Aims to Make a Tech
Statement."[40]
As the pleasure principle is
unconstrained by a moral compass based on a respect for others, it
is increasingly shaped by the need for intense excitement and a
never-ending flood of heightened sensations.
Marked by a virulent notion of hardness
and aggressive masculinity, a culture of violence has become
commonplace in a society in which pain, humiliation and abuse are
condensed into digestible spectacles endlessly circulated through
extreme sports, reality TV, video games, YouTube postings, and
proliferating forms of the new and old media.
But the ideology of hardness, and the
economy of pleasure it justifies are also present in the material
relations of power that have intensified since the Reagan
presidency, when a shift in government policies first took place and
set the stage for the emergence of unchecked torture and state
violence under the Bush-Cheney regime.
Conservative and liberal politicians
alike now spend millions waging wars around the globe, funding the
largest military state in the world, providing huge tax benefits to
the ultrarich and major corporations, and all the while draining
public coffers, increasing the scale of human poverty and misery,
and eliminating all viable public spheres - whether they be the
social state, public schools, public transportation or any other
aspect of a formative culture that addresses the needs of the common
good.
State violence, particularly the use of
torture, abductions, and targeted assassinations are now justified
as part of a state of exception in which a "political culture of
hyper-punitiveness" [41] has become normalized.
Revealing itself in a blatant display of
unbridled arrogance and power, it is unchecked by any sense of
either conscience or morality. How else to explain the right-wing
billionaire, Charles Koch, insisting that the best way to
help the poor is to get rid of the minimum wage.
In response, journalist Rod
Bastanmehr points out that,
"Koch didn't acknowledge the growing
gap between the haves and the have-nots, but he did make sure to
show off his fun new roll of $100-bill toilet paper, which was a
real treat for folks everywhere."[42]
It gets worse.
Ray Canterbury, a Republican
member of the West Virginia House of Delegates insisted that,
"students could be forced into labor
in exchange for food."[43]
In other words, students could clean
toilets, do janitorial work or other menial chores in order to pay
for their free school breakfast and lunch programs.
In Maine, Rep. Bruce Bickford (R)
has argued that the state should do away with child labor laws. His
rationale speaks for itself.
He writes:
"Kids have parents. Let the parents
be responsible for the kids. It's not up to the government to
regulate everybody's life and lifestyle. Take the government
away. Let the parents take care of their kids."[44]
This is a version of social Darwinism on
steroids, a tribute to Ayn Rand that would make even her blush.
Public values are not only under attack
in the United States and elsewhere but appear to have become
irrelevant just as those spaces that enable an experience of the
common good are now the object of disdain by right-wing and liberal
politicians, anti-public intellectuals and an army of media pundits.
State violence operating under the guise
of personal safety and security, while parading as a bulwark of
democracy, actually does the opposite and cancels out democracy,
"as the incommensurable sharing of
existence that makes the political possible."[45]
Symptoms of ethical, political and
economic impoverishment are all around us.
One recent example can be found in the
farm bill passed by Republicans, which provides $195 billion in
subsidies for agribusiness, while slashing roughly $4 billion from
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
SNAP provides food stamps for the poor.
Not only are millions of food stamp beneficiaries at risk, but it is
estimated that benefits would be eliminated for nearly two millions
Americans, many of them children.
Katrina vanden Huevel writes in
the Washington Post that it is hard to believe that any party
would want to publicize such cruel practices.
She writes:
"In this time of mass unemployment,
47 million Americans rely on food stamps. Nearly one-half are
children under 18; nearly 10 percent are impoverished seniors.
The recipients are largely white, female and young.
The Republican caucus has decided to
drop them from the bill as "extraneous," without having separate
legislation to sustain them. Who would want to advertise these
cruel values?
Neoliberal policies have produced
proliferating zones of precarity and exclusion embracing more
and more individuals and groups who lack jobs, need social
assistance, lack health care or are homeless.
According to the apostles of casino
capitalism, providing "nutritional aid to millions of pregnant
mothers, infants and children... feeding poor children and
giving them adequate health care" is a bad expenditure because
it creates "a culture of dependency - and that culture of
dependency, not runaway bankers, somehow caused our economic
crisis." [46]
But there is more to the culture of
cruelty than simply ethically challenged policies that benefit the
rich and punish the poor, particularly children, there is also the
emergence of a punishing state, a governing through crime youth
complex, and the emergence of the school-to-prison pipeline as the
new face of Jim Crow.[47]
A symptomatic example of the way
in which violence has saturated everyday life can be seen in the
increased acceptance of criminalizing the behavior of young people
in public schools.
Behaviors that were normally handled by
teachers, guidance counselors and school administrators are now
dealt with by the police and the criminal justice system. The
consequences have been disastrous for many young people.
Increasingly, poor minority and white
youth are being,
"funneled directly from schools into
prison. Instead of schools being a pipeline to opportunity,
schools are feeding our prisons."
Justified by the war on drugs, the
United States is in the midst of a prison binge made obvious by the
fact that,
"Since 1970, the number of people
behind bars... has increased 600 percent."[48]
Moreover, it is estimated that in some
cities such as Washington, DC, that 75 percent of young black men
can expect to serve time in prison.
Michelle Alexander has pointed
out that,
"One in three young African American
men is currently under the control of the criminal justice
system in prison, in jail, on probation, or on parole - yet mass
incarceration tends to be categorized as a criminal justice
issue as opposed to a racial justice or civil rights issue (or
crisis)."[49]
Young black men in American have an
identity ascribed to them that is a direct legacy of slavery.
They are considered dangerous,
expendable, threatening and part of a culture of criminality. They
are guilty of criminal behavior not because of the alleged crimes
they might commit but because they are the product of a collective
imagination paralyzed by the racism of a white supremacist culture
they can only view them as a dangerous nightmare.
But the real nightmare resides in a
society that hides behind the mutually informing and poisonous
notions of colorblindness and a post-racial society, a convenient
rhetorical obfuscation that allows white Americans to ignore the
institutional and individual racist ideologies, practices and
policies that cripple any viable notion of justice and democracy.
As the Trayvon Martin case and
verdict made clear, young black men are not only being arrested and
channeled into the criminal justice system in record numbers, they
are also being targeted by the police, harassed by security forces,
and in some instances killed because they are black and assumed to
be dangerous.[50]
Under such circumstances, not only do
schools resemble the culture of prisons, but young children are
being arrested and subjected to court appearances for behaviors that
can only be termed as trivial.
How else to explain the case of a
diabetic student who, because she fell asleep in study hall, was
arrested and beaten by the police or the arrest of a 7-year-old boy,
who because of a fight he got into with another boy in the
schoolyard, was put in handcuffs and held in custody for 10 hours in
a Bronx police station.
In Texas, students who miss school are
not sent to the principal's office or assigned to detention.
Instead, they are fined, and in too many cases, actually jailed.
It is hard to imagine, but in a Maryland
school, a 13- year old girl was arrested for refusing to say the
pledge of allegiance.
There is more at work than stupidity and
a flight from responsibility on the part of educators, parents and
politicians who maintain these laws, there is also the growing
sentiment that young people constitute a threat to adults and that
the only way to deal with them is to subject them to mind-crushing
punishment.
This medieval type of punishment
inflicts pain on the psyche and the body of young people as part of
a public spectacle.
Even more disturbing is how the legacy
of slavery informs this practice given that,
"Arrests and police interactions...
disproportionately affect low-income schools with large
African-American and Latino populations"[51]
Poor minorities live in a new age of Jim
Crow, one in which the ravages of segregation, racism, poverty and
dashed hopes are amplified by the forces of "privatization,
financialization, militarization and criminalization," fashioning a
new architecture of punishment, massive human suffering and
authoritarianism.[52]
Students being miseducated,
criminalized and arrested through a form of penal pedagogy in
prison-type schools provide a grim reminder of the degree to which
the ethos of containment and punishment now creeps into spheres of
everyday life that were largely immune in the past from this type of
state violence.
This is not merely barbarism parading as
reform - it is also a blatant indicator of the degree to which
sadism and the infatuation with violence have become normalized in a
society that seems to take delight in dehumanizing itself.
Widespread violence now functions as
part of an anti-immune system that turns the economy of genuine
pleasure into a mode of sadism that creates the foundation for
sapping democracy of any political substance and moral vitality. The
predominance of the disimagination machine in American society,
along with its machinery of social death and historical amnesia,
seeps into in all aspects of life, suggesting that young people and
others marginalized by class, race and ethnicity have been
abandoned.
But historical and public memory is not
merely on the side of domination.
As the anthropologist, David Price,
points out, historical memory is a potent weapon in fighting against
the "desert of organized forgetting" and implies a rethinking of the
role that artists, intellectuals, educators, youth and other
concerned citizens can play in fostering a,
"reawakening of America's battered
public memories."[53]
Against the tyranny of forgetting,
educators, young people, social activists, public intellectuals,
workers and others can work to make visible and oppose the long
legacy and current reality of state violence and the rise of the
punishing state.
Such a struggle suggests not only
reclaiming, for instance, education as a public good but also
reforming the criminal justice system and removing the police from
schools.
In addition, there is a need to employ
public memory, critical theory, and other intellectual archives and
resources to expose the crimes of those market-driven criminogenc
regimes of power that now run the commanding institutions of
society, with particular emphasis on how they have transformed the
welfare state into a warfare state.
The rise of casino capitalism and the
punishing state with their vast apparatuses of real and symbolic
violence must be also addressed as part of a broader historical and
political attack on public values, civic literacy and economic
justice. Crucial here is the need to engage how such an attack is
aided and abetted by the emergence of a poisonous neoliberal public
pedagogy that depoliticizes as much as it entertains and corrupts.
State violence cannot be defined simply
as a political issue but also as a pedagogical issue that wages
violence against the minds, desires, bodies and identities of young
people as part of the reconfiguration of the social state into the
punishing state.
At the heart of this transformation is
the emergence of a new form of corporate sovereignty, a more intense
form of state violence, a ruthless survival-of-the-fittest ethic
used to legitimate the concentrated power of the rich, and a
concerted effort to punish young people who are out of step with
neoliberal ideology, values and modes of governance.
The value of making young people stupid,
subject to an educational deficit has enormous currency in a society
in which existing relations of power are normalized.
Under such conditions, those who hold
power accountable are reviewed as treasonous while critically
engaged young people are denounced as un-American.[54]
In any totalitarian society, dissent is
viewed as a threat, civic literacy is denounced, and those public
spheres that produce engage citizens are dismantled or impoverished
through the substitution of training for education.
It is important to note that Edward
Snowden was labeled as a spy not a whistle-blower - even though
he exposed the reach of the spy services into the lives of most
Americans.
More importantly, he was denounced as
being part of a generation that unfortunately combined being
educated with a distrust of authority.
Of course, these antidemocratic
tendencies represent more than a threat to young people, they also
put in peril all of those individuals, groups, public spheres and
institutions now considered disposable because that are at odds with
a world run by bankers, the financial elite and the rich.
Only a well-organized movement of young
people, educators, workers, parents, religious groups and other
concerned citizens will be capable of changing the power relations
and vast economic inequalities that have generated what has become a
country in which it is almost impossible to recognize the ideals of
a real democracy.
Conclusion
The rise of the punishing state and the
governing-through-crime youth complex throughout American society
suggests the need for a politics that not only negates the
established order but imagines a new one, one informed by a radical
vision in which the future does not imitate the present.[55]
In this discourse, critique merges with
a sense of realistic hope or what I call educated hope, and
individual struggles merge into larger social movements.
The challenges that young people are
mobilizing against oppressive societies all over the globe are being
met with a state-sponsored violence that is about more than police
brutality.
This is especially clear in the United
States, given its transformation from a social state to a warfare
state, from a state that once embraced a semblance of the social
contract to one that no longer has a language for justice, community
and solidarity - a state in which the bonds of fear and
commodification have replaced the bonds of civic responsibility and
democratic vision.
Until educators, individuals, artists,
intellectuals and various social movements address how the
metaphysics of casino capitalism, war and violence have taken hold
on American society (and in other parts of the world) along with the
savage social costs they have enacted, the forms of social,
political, and economic violence that young people are protesting
against, as well as the violence waged in response to their
protests, will become impossible to recognize and act on.
If the ongoing struggles waged by young
people are to matter, demonstrations and protests must give way to
more sustainable organizations that develop alternative communities,
autonomous forms of worker control, collective forms of health care,
models of direct democracy and emancipatory modes of education.
Education must become central to any
viable notion of politics willing to imagine a life and future
outside of casino capitalism.
There is a need for educators, young
people, artists and other cultural workers to develop an educative
politics in which people can address the historical, structural and
ideological conditions at the core of the violence being waged by
the corporate and repressive state and to make clear that government
under the dictatorship of market sovereignty and power is no longer
responsive to the most basic needs of young people - or most people
for that matter.
The issue of who gets to define the
future, own the nation's wealth, shape the parameters of the social
state, control the globe's resources, and create a formative culture
for producing engaged and socially responsible citizens is no longer
a rhetorical issue, but offers up new categories for defining how
matters of representations, education, economic justice, and
politics are to be defined and fought over.
At stake here is the need for both a
language of critique and possibility.
A discourse for broad-based political
change is crucial for developing a politics that speaks to a future
that can provide sustainable jobs, decent health care, quality
education and communities of solidarity and support for young
people.
Such a vision is crucial and relies on
ongoing educational and political struggles to awaken the
inhabitants of neoliberal societies to their current reality and
what it means to be educated not only to think outside of neoliberal
commonsense but also to struggle for those values, hopes, modes of
solidarity, power relations and institutions that infuse democracy
with a spirit of egalitarianism and economic and social justice and
make the promise of democracy a goal worth fighting for.
For this reason, any collective struggle
that matters has to embrace education as the center of politics and
the source of an embryonic vision of the good life outside of the
imperatives of predatory capitalism.
Too many progressives and people on the
left are stuck in the discourse of foreclosure and cynicism and need
to develop what Stuart Hall calls a,
"sense of politics being educative,
of politics changing the way people see things."[56]
This is a difficult task, but what we
are seeing in cities such as Chicago, Athens and other dead zones of
capitalism throughout the world is the beginning of a long struggle
for the institutions, values and infrastructures that make critical
education and community the center of a robust, radical democracy.
This is a challenge for young people and
all those invested in the promise of a democracy that extends not
only the meaning of politics, but also a commitment to economic
justice and democratic social change.
