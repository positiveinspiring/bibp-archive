Every four years, the illusion of democracy and accountable government is reinforced to the public by an expensive media circus and presidential election.
Meanwhile, an annual conference of members of the world's wealthiest and most influential is held in near-secrecy with little attention given to the significance of such a gathering.
Why are we encouraged to vote for politicians, but discouraged from considering the sobering fact that the United States and other Western nations are now ruled by a corporate and private oligarchy?
An intensive research study by Princeton University in 2014 concluded that the US is indeed more accurately described as a functioning oligarchy, rather than a democracy or a republic.
An oligarchy is a small group of people who effectively control a country, a business, or an institution.
Rulers may distinguish themselves as,
royalty, politicians, businessmen, wealthy, highly educated, or as people in positions of military control.
The study also found:

Attendees and organizers of the Bilderberg conference hold key positions of influence in government, industry, or are of significant social influence. They have the capacity to affect world events in ways that elected officials simply do not.
The conference is a chance for them to congregate without the burden of official responsibilities or a permanent record.
Every year, between 120-150 political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media are invited to take part in the meeting. The meeting is a forum for informal discussions about megatrends and major issues facing the world. The meetings are held under the Chatham House Rule, which states that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) nor of any other participant may be revealed. Thanks to the private nature of the meeting, the participants are not bound by the conventions of their office or by pre-agreed positions. Bilderberg

Bilderberg represents the globalization of empire, a form of international rule where the ideas and goals of a wealthy elite are realized through an organization of business and personal contacts.
Coverage of this event is mostly done by independent journalists who face serious harassment and intimidation by law enforcement and private security, which is in stark contrast to the volume and type of media attention given to presidential politics.
What most Americans believe to be 'Public Opinion' is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. And noted Australian academic and activist Alex Carey (1922-1988) explained the three most important 20th century developments: the growth of democracy the growth of corporate power the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy Canadian writer Ken Adachi

The passion that the American people have for self-governance is evident in how seriously people take local and national American politics.
It would be impressive to see this same energy directed at the roots of global problems by re-directing accountability onto those who are better deserving of our collective attention.
A righteously outraged and unified public is capable of swift and furious social and political change, which is why the elite use propaganda.
Some 90% of all media consumed in the world is owned and controlled by few mega-corporations, who, by omission and other tactics, work to manufacture consent while keeping we the people divided in every way possible.
