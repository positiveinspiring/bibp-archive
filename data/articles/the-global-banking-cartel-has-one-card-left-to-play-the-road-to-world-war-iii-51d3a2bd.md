Part One
I - Economic Imperial
Operations
When we analyze our current crisis, focusing on the past few years of
economic activity blinds us to the history and context that are vital to
understanding the root cause.
What we have been experiencing is not the result
of an unforeseen economic crash that appeared out of the blue with the
collapse of the housing market. It was certainly not brought on by people
who bought homes they couldnt afford.
To frame this crisis around a debate
on economic theory misses the point entirely. To even blame it on greedy
bankers, while essentially accurate, also misses the most vital point.
This crisis is the direct result of a strategic economic attack on the
existence of a middle class and democracy worldwide. The stock market and
economy have become weapons of mass oppression manipulated by an imperial
banking cartel to impose order and exploit the masses.
This crisis boldly represents the manifest
evolution of the
fascist spirit reasserting itself as the
dominant ideology.
Any fairytale notions of the United States being a democratic republic built
on the
rule of law have been
utterly dispelled. As a nation we have been
bred and conditioned to be dangerously naïve to the darker forces which
operate beyond the spotlight of the mainstream media. We have been blinded
to what has been developing throughout the world.
The economic imperialism that has now blown-back to the
United States and
Europe has been evolving for decades and
can be directly traced back to the end of World War II, to the birth of
the CIA,
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and
World Bank.
For those of us who have been paying attention to economic imperial
operations that have been carried out against countries throughout the
world, this looks
all too familiar. The IMF and global
bankers have conquered the second and third world, and they have now moved
on to countries within the first world. Western European and American
working classes are in the cross-hairs now.
Economic and societal indicators, along with recent
G-20 policy decisions, clearly demonstrate
that they are carrying out and escalating systemic economic attacks
throughout Europe and the US.
To put it in technical terms, the United States government has been taken
over by a financial terrorism network. They have bought off leaders
of both the Republican and Democratic parties, and have established a
dominant role in all three branches of government and throughout the
mainstream media.
They have complete control of,
the economy
stock market
US Treasury
Federal Reserve
World Bank
IMF
global banking system
Free market capitalism has collapsed; its now a
rigged global market. This is an organized criminal operation, an imperial
fascist movement that is determined to
destroy our very way of life.
A war has already been launched against us.
In just the past three years we have lost an unprecedented amount of
national wealth, trillions upon trillions of our tax dollars have been
looted by Wall Street, endless wars, enormous subsidies for the most
profitable global corporations and tax cuts for the richest one percent of
the population. Never before, in the history of civilization, has a nation
been so thoroughly and systematically fleeced.
This is all the result of a coordinated economic attack by a global banking
cartel
against 99 percent of the US population.
Until we can become politically intelligent enough to see this as the
reality and root cause of our current crisis, we will not be able to
overcome it, our living standards will continue to decline and we will all
be sentenced to a slow death in a neo-feudal system built on debt slavery.
The average American is horribly naïve to just how depraved, corrupt and
addicted to power this banking cartel is. Through their control and
domination of the mass media, they have kept their crimes against humanity
out of public consciousness. We have been shielded from the global
devastation and death toll that they have already wrought.
The result is an unsuspecting population of
confused and passive people having their future ripped out from under them,
right before their eyes, without any organized defense or resistance.
II - Violence on the
Horizon
As the entrenched global banking cartel continues to control domestic
political policy, the next phase of this crisis will inevitably feature an
escalation into mass violence.
As the Army War College stated, the Pentagon is
preparing for,
violent, strategic dislocation inside the
United States and widespread civil violence due to purposeful
domestic resistance.
In clear signs of
what is to come, rioting and violence as a
result of economic turmoil has already been experienced in many countries
throughout the world.
However, civil unrest has not yet occurred
within the United States. There are many theories as to why there has been
so little resistance from the US population thus far, and several factors
play into it.
The most significant factor is that social
safety net programs have been vital in preventing people from resorting to
extreme measures. Currently, a stunning number of Americans,
52 million, are receiving life-sustaining
assistance from government anti-poverty programs, such as food stamps,
unemployment benefits, Medicaid and Medicare.
This has already stretched a social safety net
system that is designed to handle significantly less people to its limit.
This safety net system has now been drained of all reserve resources over
the past two years, and is obviously not sustainable under current economic
and political conditions.
As social safety net programs have been drained of reserves, many US
citizens have also been burning through their personal savings. Over the
past few years the percentage of Americans living paycheck to paycheck has
dramatically increased.
In 2007, 43 percent of Americans were
living paycheck to paycheck.
In 2008, the percentage increased to 49
percent.
In 2009, the number skyrocketed up to
61 percent.
The most recent number for 2010 has
exploded to a shocking
77 percent.
This means in our nation of 310 million
citizens, 239 million Americans are one setback away from
economic ruin and millions more are in danger of having to rely on
government assistance for survival.
So as this prolonged economic crisis continues, these safety nets, that are
already overwhelmed, will have to support more and more people and will
inevitably break down. As we have just begun to see, budget cuts to vital
social programs on the state and federal levels will become increasingly
severe right at the point when many more Americans will need them.
As the 52 million Americans currently surviving
in anti-poverty programs are gradually cutoff from life-sustaining
government assistance - and as the 239 million people now living paycheck to
paycheck, buried in debt, stressing out and working their asses off just to
make ends meet realize that things are not going to be getting any better -
and are only going to get worse - social unrest and outbursts of violence
will eventually start to bubble up to the surface and
the
ruling elite will no longer be able to maintain power by simply
deceiving the masses via mainstream media propaganda.
When an overwhelming majority of the population directly feels negative
effects upon their own living standards, the propaganda system collapses.
The illusion comes crashing down and people will
finally start to get wise to the horrific scam that is being played on them.
When they wake from their
media-induced American dream state and
realize that they are now living in a nightmare, as crazy as it may sound,
people will actually stop voting against their own interests.
The apathetic majority, that doesnt vote, will
become active in the interests of self-preservation as their survival
instincts kick in.
The handwriting is on the wall and the ruling class has to realize that by
the time
2012 rolls around, their puppet politicians will be voted out of
office, or their heads will roll, quite literally.
Looking at this from a purely technocratic sociological viewpoint, avoiding
mass riots and violence while this many desperate people lose
life-sustaining programs appears to be an impossible task, and given our
current economic and political environment this seems inevitable.
In an article titled A
Planet at the Brink - Will Economic Brushfires Prove Too Virulent to Contain?
Michael T. Klare explained:
As people lose confidence in the ability of
markets and governments to solve the global crisis, they are likely to
erupt into violent protests or to assault others they deem responsible
for their plight, including government officials, plant managers,
landlords, immigrants, and ethnic minorities. (The list could, in the
future, prove long and unnerving.)
If the present economic disaster turns into
what President Obama has referred to as a lost decade, the result
could be a global landscape filled with economically-fueled upheavals.
Former National Security Adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski expressed his fears:
I was worrying about it because were going
to have millions and millions of unemployed, people really facing dire
straits. And were going to be having that for some period of time
before things hopefully improve. And at the same time there is public
awareness of this extraordinary wealth that was transferred to a few
individuals at levels without historical precedent in America
.
And you sort of say to yourself: whats going to happen in this society
when these people are without jobs, when their families hurt, when they
lose their homes, and so forth?
Outbreaks of civil unrest are something that the
US government and Pentagon have been expecting, and preparing for.
Former US Director of National Intelligence
Dennis Blair testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee stating
that the greatest threat facing the US is not terrorism, its the current
economic crisis:
The primary near-term security concern of
the United States is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical
implications. The crisis has been ongoing
Of course, all of us recall
the dramatic political consequences wrought by the economic turmoil of
the 1920s and 1930s in Europe, the instability, and high levels of
violent extremism.
Intelligence Committee Vice-Chair Christopher
Bond said the economic crisis is now,
the primary focus of the intelligence
community.
As the Army War College has warned, the
response to this coming phase of the economic crisis,
might include use of military force against
hostile groups inside the United States. Further, DoD [the Department of
Defense] would be, by necessity, an essential enabling hub for the
continuity of political authority in a multi-state or nationwide civil
conflict or disturbance.
Journalist Chris Hedges
summed up this report:
The specter of social unrest was raised at
the US Army War College in November in a monograph titled Known
Unknowns: Unconventional Strategic Shocks in Defense
Strategy Development
The widespread civil violence, the document said, would force the
defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic
domestic order and human security.
An American government and defense establishment lulled into
complacency by a long-secure domestic order would be forced to rapidly
divest some or most external security commitments in order to address
rapidly expanding human insecurity at home, it went on
In plain English, something bureaucrats and the military seem incapable
of employing, this translates into the imposition of martial law and a
de facto government being run out of the Department of Defense. They are
considering it. So should you.
III - The IMF Riot, Step 3.5
The International Monetary Fund is predicting a social explosion due to
this crisis.
The IMF and World Bank have a long history of
creating social upheaval. Leaked documents from within the World Bank refer
to the next phase of the crisis as the IMF riot.
Journalist Greg Palast obtained classified
planning documents, which shed light on
the covert economic imperial operations, Structural Adjustment Programs,
that the IMF, World Bank and US Treasury have used in the past as a playbook
for destabilizing and conquering foreign nations.
In the UK newspaper
The Observer, Palast interviewed Nobel
Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who was a former World Bank
Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, turned whistleblower.
They revealed the four-step IMF plan. Though the
strategy is slightly modified based on the nation being attacked, here in
the United States we are currently about to enter a variation of
step-three, which is currently being phased in throughout Europe. This
step inevitably leads to a significant portion of the population losing the
ability to obtain basic necessities essential for survival.
Once this happens, riots inevitably occur, or as
they put it: step 3.5 is executed.
Here is how Palast and Stiglitz summed it up:
At this point, according to Stiglitz, the
IMF drags the gasping nation to Step Three: market-based pricing - a
fancy term for raising prices on food, water and
gas.
This leads, predictably, to Step-Three-and-a-Half: what Stiglitz calls
the IMF riot.
The IMF riot is painfully predictable. When a nation is, down and out,
[the IMF] squeezes the last drop of blood out of them. They turn up the
heat until, finally, the whole cauldron blows up,
What Stiglitz did not know is that Newsnight obtained several documents
from inside the World Bank. In one, last years Interim Country
Assistance Strategy for Ecuador, the Bank several times suggests - with
cold accuracy - that the plans could be expected to spark social
unrest.
To sum up, the interlocked IMF and World Bank
set the conditions for social unrest and then once it occurs they move to
step-four, which is the ultimate in
disaster capitalism - they profit off
the misery and the civilian population is then buried in a neo-feudal system
of severe debt and poverty.
So what is the IMF saying right now about our situation in Europe and the
US?
A recent
Telegraph report reads:
IMF fears social explosion from world jobs crisis
America and Europe face the worst
jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk an explosion of social unrest
unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has
warned
.
Olivier Blanchard, the IMFs chief economist, said the percentage of
workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for
decades but the figures have surged this time. Long-term unemployment
is alarmingly high: in the US, half the unemployed have been out of work
for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great
Depression, he said
.
The IMF said there may be a link between rising inequality within
Western economies and deflating demand. Historians say the last time
that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes was in 1928-1929
To show you how insidious the IMF is, they have
recently launched a propaganda campaign to
publicly decry deficit budget
cuts and austerity measures.
However, behind the scenes they have been
forcing
implementation of them and making their
usual demands for cuts in
vital social services and public spending, once those cuts are in place, the
riots obviously follow.
A recent
Washington Post report states:
IMF issues broad call for US financial prudence
Cut Social Security. Ditch the
deduction for interest on home mortgages. Tax gasoline.
The United States recently opened itself to the most intense scrutiny
yet by the International Monetary Fund, and on Thursday was offered a
bitter pill when the agency criticized some well-defended aspects of
American culture - cheap fuel, subsidized housing, and a government
retirement check
Economist Dean Baker
writes:
The central bankers and their accomplices
at the IMF are dictating policies to democratically elected governments.
Their agenda seems to be the same everywhere, cut back retirement
benefits, reduce public support for health care, weaken unions and make
ordinary workers take pay cuts.
In another report Baker
adds:
The IMF program calls for cutbacks in
government support for healthcare, pensions, and a wide range of other
public services. It also calls for weakening labor market regulations
that provide workers with job security.
These recommendations are being given in a context where the world
economy is suffering from a massive shortfall of demand. In other words,
tens of millions of people are unemployed right now because there is not
enough spending to keep them employed. The IMFs program is almost
certain to reduce spending further leading to even larger shortfalls in
demand and more unemployment
The IMFs track record gives us reason not only to question the
institutions competence but also its motivations
It is possible to see
a similar pattern in the IMFs latest set of policy recommendations to
deal with the economic crisis.
In an article entitled, The Attack of the Real
Black Helicopter Gang - The IMF Is Coming for Your Social Security, Baker
continues:
Last week, the IMF told the United States
that it needs to start getting its budget deficit down. It put cutting
Social Security at the top of the steps that the country should take to
achieve deficit reduction. This one is more than a bit outrageous for
two reasons
While the IMF has no problem warning about retired workers getting too
much in Social Security benefits, it apparently could not find its voice
when the issue was the junk securities from Goldman Sachs or Citigroup
that helped to fuel the housing bubble.
The collapse of this bubble has not only sank the world economy, it also
destroyed most of the savings of the near retirees for whom the IMF
wants to cut Social Security. The vast majority of middle-income
retirees have most of their wealth in their home equity. This home
equity largely disappeared when the bubble burst.
So the IMF and global banking cartel are setting
the conditions for social unrest and pushing for policies that will provoke
it, and the Pentagon is preparing for a military response. As scary and
unbelievable as all this may sound, we are on a fast track to this scenario.
To Sum Up
The American and global economy have already been looted and destroyed
beyond repair.
Most serious economists will admit that
governments have already exhausted their capital by bailing out the banks
and taking on unprecedented amounts of debt. The bailouts and recent return
to high profits were just the final phase of the looting and a further
consolidation of wealth on an unprecedented scale.
There are still
tens of trillions of dollars in
debt hidden off-the-books and hundreds of trillions of dollars (see below
video) in dark pools
of derivative liability.
As the downturn continues, there is nothing left to
revive the economy, the reserves and safety nets have already been stretched
to their limits.
We have a political and economic system that has been overrun by organized
corruption and theft. Along with a mass media system that does not inform
the populace and has effectively marginalized and isolated the majority of
the population. Meanwhile, bubbling just under the surface is a very heavily
armed population with a militia movement that has doubled in size over the
past year, and their memberships continue to rapidly grow.
Without the necessary general political
intelligence or infrastructure to organize an effective mass non-violent
movement, we are steamrolling toward spontaneous riots and outbursts of
armed insurrection.
In other words, as this economic downturn continues, what is now a passive
and confused population will eventually devolve into an explosion of
violence. Without a coherent non-violent movement to provide a viable
alternative, without an outlet for severe and legitimate grievances that
provides any chance for urgently affecting necessary political change,
people will resort to violence as a last desperate act of vengeance and
frustration.
As time passes, these forgotten and isolated
people, tens of millions of them, are quickly running out of options, and
they will act out just as exploited people throughout the world always have.
A man who sparked a revolution against the same banking cartel that has
caused our crisis described the general attitude among a population that
successfully rebelled through armed insurrection:
The people are weary of being oppressed,
persecuted, exploited to the maximum. They are weary of the wretched
selling of their labor-power day after day - faced with the fear of
joining the enormous mass of unemployed - so that the greatest profit
can be wrung from each human body, profit later squandered in the orgies
of the masters of capital
The feeling of revolt will grow stronger every day among the peoples
subjected to various degrees of exploitation, and they will take up arms
to gain by force the rights which reason alone has not won them.
Whatever your preconceptions of the man who said
this may be, the voice of Che Guevara can now be clearly understood and
related to by the overwhelming majority of people throughout the United
States.
Already, despite intensive propaganda, a stunning
80 percent of the US
population believes that the government has failed them. The health care and
financial reform bills have proven that our politicians are much more
concerned about the short-sighted necessity to please the
Economic Elite and
raise campaign funds, than they are to understand the consequences of
millions of Americans being forced into situations where their very survival
is threatened.
In a system where
most elected officials are
millionaires, this lack of perspective and understanding is ultimately what
will lead to violence. Whether it is by arrogance or ignorance, perhaps
both, it appears that our ruling class has suicidal tendencies.
Unless they quickly recognize the growing threat
posed by the dispossessed masses, our puppet politicians will themselves be
in harms way.
To show you how incredibly out of touch our current elected officials are,
and to give you a clear indication of the prevailing attitude on Capitol
Hill, a
recent report from the Washington Post summed up their response to
the recent news that a record number of Americans are now living in poverty:
The reluctance of political leaders on both
sides of the aisle to directly confront the fact that growing numbers of
Americans are slipping into poverty reflects a stubborn reality about
the poor: They are not much of a political constituency.
We talk to many people on Capitol Hill who do believe poverty is
important and is a blight on our nation, but we are also up against a
general recognition that poor people dont vote in great numbers. And
they certainly arent going to be making campaign contributions. That
definitely puts them behind many other people and interests when
decisions are being made around here.
And that sums up our current crisis, doesnt it?
The poor people dont vote and they dont make campaign contributions.
As the Rage Against the Machine song goes,
The riot be the rhyme of the unheard.
IV - Bang the Drums of War
How will this imperial fascist banking cartel respond to revolt? How will
they maintain their power over an increasingly radicalized and hostile US
population?
In an attempt to stave off organized rebellion, they are already escalating
their propaganda efforts in attempts to divide and distract the population.
The tactics of their divide and conquer strategy are already on full
display.
Their mainstream media outlets have drastically
increased coverage and focused attention on the rhetoric of division - using
divisive issues like immigration, racism, religious bigotry, the lazy
unemployed, entitlement welfare and gay marriage to divide and distract
the population and prevent the masses from organizing against their true
oppressors.
This propaganda effort is only a temporary measure and will not suffice over
the long-term. As the economy continues to collapse, the banking elite risk
being overthrown as a result of their own greed. So they will then turn to
physical, military-based violence to suppress populations that can no longer
be controlled through propaganda and economic coercion.
To paraphrase policy analyst Anatol Lieven, the classic strategy of an
endangered oligarchy is to divert discontent among the population into
nationalistic militarism.
It is time, once again, to bang the drums of war
and whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor.
The source of the following quote is unknown,
but the evident wisdom of it is something that we have already experienced
firsthand in the recent past:
Beware the leader who bangs the drum of war
in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism
is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it
narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch
and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will
have no need in seizing the rights of citizenry.
Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and
blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader
and gladly so.
An increased external threat will lead to an
increased internal crackdown, which creates the pretext and conditions for a
police state.
As we have already seen in the first phase of
the crackdown on civil liberties since the War
on Terror began, when rioting and outbursts of armed
insurrection begin within the US, external threats, real or imagined, will
again be presented to justify extreme measures to suppress American
citizens, and to further repress and divert internal dissent.
Without an external enemy to rally the
population against, the population will rally against the pre-existing
internal powers.
To put a slight twist on what Guy DeBord insightfully said back in
1988: the banking cartel,
constructs its own inconceivable foe,
terrorism. Its wish is to be judged by its enemies rather than by its
results. The story of terrorism is written by the state and it is
therefore highly instructive.
But they must always know enough to convince
them that, compared with terrorism, everything else must be acceptable,
or in any case more rational and democratic.
V - The Chinese
Scapegoat: Trade & Currency Wars
As millions of Americans and the majority of the global population look for
vengeance on those responsible for severely declining living standards, the
global banking cartel are not going to blame themselves, so they will
deflect blame to China, a most convenient target.
As a result of the crisis, national currencies are reeling, and the dollar,
although currently one of the strongest paper currencies, is losing power as
the crisis escalates.
The IMF is working to replace the dollar as the
world reserve currency and have begun discussing the possibility of making
their Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) the new world reserve currency.
A
plummeting dollar will obviously put the American population in a severely
desperate situation and the US-based banking cartel needs an excuse to
divert political backlash.
In China, the nation poised to replace the US as
the preeminent global superpower, they have the perfect scapegoat.
US-based global corporations have been shifting their business to China and
off-shoring millions of jobs to the region due to their extremely low worker
wages. So the American population is already pre-disposed to blaming China,
as opposed to the companies who are exploiting the cheap labor. US
politicians have been conveniently shifting blame for unemployment from
themselves to China.
Meanwhile, China also owns a significant portion
of US national debt. US Admiral Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, has recently declared that the national debt is the number
one security threat.
As Mullen
stated,
Tax payers will be paying around $600
billion in interest on the national debt by 2012.
A significant portion of this interest will be
going to China.
As national governments attempt to survive in an increasingly hostile global
economy, trade and currency wars will flare up and escalate. China is in
perhaps the
strongest position to win these conflicts. China and Japan have
just engaged in a fierce currency battle. This currency battle is not to be
underestimated. We are talking about the worlds second and third largest
economies, after the United States.
China has just overtaken Japan for the number
two position. The
militant rhetoric between these two nations is escalating.
US politicians were quick to jump on the situation with calls to classify
China as a currency manipulator and impose trade tariffs and penalties
against them.
International economic reporter Barry Grey recently summed up the
situation in an article entitled, Economic crisis threatens to unleash
global currency wars:
The eruption of currency exchange conflicts
is bound up with mounting signs that the global economic crisis is
systemic, rather than merely conjunctural, and growing fears that a
genuine recovery is not in the offing.
The European sovereign debt
crisis and the weakening of US economic growth have led governments
around the world to seek to secure a greater share of export markets.
Under conditions of slowing growth and stagnant markets, this inevitably
heightens trade conflicts between competing capitalist nations.
In particular, the US and the European Union, spearheaded by the export
power Germany, have aggressively pursued a cheap currency policy in
order to gain a trade advantage against their rivals. Of the major
economic powers, Japan has suffered the greatest damage from these
policies, as investors and speculators have shifted from dollar- and
euro-denominated investments to the yen, driving up the currencys
exchange rate.
This has embittered relations between Japan and both the US and the EU.
Japan has also denounced China for artificially keeping its currency low
while bidding up the yen by increasing its purchases of Japanese
government securities.
The global banking cartels leading puppets on
Capitol Hill, Senators Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer and Richard Shelby were all
quick to attack China.
Barry Grey
continued:
In opening the Senate Banking Committee
hearing, Chairman Christopher Dodd declared China a currency manipulator
and said its economic and trade policies present roadblocks to our
recovery. He went on to accuse China of stealing intellectual property,
violating international trade agreements and dumping goods. He also
denounced China for acquiring national resources in developing countries
and building up its military.
In his opening statement, the ranking Republican on the committee,
Richard Shelby of Alabama, declared, There is no question that China
manipulates its currency in order to subsidize Chinese exports. The only
question is: Why is the administration protecting China by refusing to
designate it as a currency manipulator?
Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said, Chinas currency
manipulation is like a boot on the throat of our recovery and this
administration refuses to try to get China to remove that boot.
On top of all this, China has now overtaken the
US as the worlds top energy consumer.
Michael T. Klare reports on Chinas
new
position of power:
The main point: by becoming the worlds
leading energy consumer, China will also become an ever more dominant
international actor and so set the pace in shaping our global future.
Because energy is tied to so many aspects of the global economy, and
because doubts are growing about the future availability of oil and
other vital fuels, the decisions China makes regarding its energy
portfolio will have far-reaching consequences. As the leading player in
the global energy market, China will significantly determine not only
the prices we will be paying for critical fuels but also the type of
energy systems we will come to rely on.
More importantly, Chinas decisions on
energy preferences will largely determine whether China and the United
States can avoid becoming embroiled in a global struggle over imported
oil and whether the world will escape catastrophic climate change.
Chinas rise in power, mixed with the decline of
western economies and the need for an external scapegoat sets up a global
collision and inevitable confrontation between vying superpowers.
Currency and trade wars will likely be a prelude
to military confrontation.
VI - Moves Upon the
Grand Chessboard
Based on early maneuvering it is evident that the masters of war have
already drawn up sides.
You may have missed it, but the US, Israel and
the NATO Alliance have already put Iran, Lebanon, Syria, North Korea,
Venezuela, Russia and China on notice. And the withdrawals from Iraq and
the Af-Pak region are over-hyped. The occupation of these countries
continues with no end in sight. In fact, they arent withdrawing as much as
they are repositioning and shifting their forces, preparing for an
escalation.
In many ways the wars in Iraq and Af-Pak have
only been the initial phase of a global attack, positioning forces and
building massive military bases in pivotal geo-strategic locations. The
operations in this region have essentially been a warm-up for much
wider-ranging attacks against much stronger countries.
While most of the US population is playing
checkers, seeing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as one-off battles, the
global banking cartel is playing chess, using these wars as only initial
geo-strategic moves in a grand strategy toward total world domination.
The intensity of military maneuvering presently occurring is alarming.

So there we have it.
The global Economic Elite have effectively
looted and destroyed national economies worldwide, the propaganda system is
quickly collapsing, and the masses are beginning to get restless. Its time
to move to the next phase of the attack. Preparations are already underway.
We are on the road to World War III.
VII - Resource Wars
Add to this picture rapidly declining natural resources and an increasingly
hostile and polluted environment with extreme weather events frequently
pounding the globe. In the past decade the global corporate elite have
already engaged in three major resource wars in Iraq, Af-Pak and Northern
Africa.
With a growing global population and an increasing demand for declining
resources, we have already crossed a tipping point and are now in the
ecological red.
For the first time in human history, we are now consuming
resources faster than nature can produce them.
As developing countries like
China and India attempt to live like western countries, there are simply not
enough resources. The global economy is built on an unsustainable
foundation.
Instead of evolving and changing course, the entrenched banking
power base is digging in further, and they run NATO, the private military
complex and the US government. Based on the current policies that are in
place, they have clearly already decided that they want to keep living
business as usual and refuse to evolve and adapt to a rapidly changing
environment.
With this decision, they have effectively
already decided to further escalate their oppression of the overwhelming
majority of humanity, and this will lead to the death of literally hundreds
of millions of people.
The global banking cartel view the worlds limited resources as their
property, and they have consistently proven that they have absolutely no
hesitation in killing millions upon millions of people for these resources -
just look at what they have already done in the recent past throughout
Northern Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
In the years since Northern Africa was discovered to be the richest patch
of earth due to large deposits of natural minerals that are needed to power
computer technologies,
over five million Africans, in just that region, have
died as a result of war.
The global elite have consistently used a strategy of arming and funding
both sides of armed conflicts.
While opposing populations kill each other off,
they make off with their
natural resources. When they confront a government
that cannot be bribed or provoked into civil or regional war, they fund
brutal death squads, attempt military coups and intimidate them by giving
weapons to undemocratic neighboring regimes. If all that doesnt work, they
are declared a threat to national security and the US military, private
contractors and NATO forces invade and occupy the country.
These terrorist strategies are not limited to the Middle East and Africa,
just ask our neighbors throughout Latin America about the School of the
Americas.
Contrary to popular belief, the horrendous
torture techniques inflicted upon people in Abu Ghraib, Iraq were not an
isolated incident. Many of those
brutal torture techniques were developed
over years by torturing innocent civilians throughout Latin America.
The picture in Latin America today is one of inspiration. People throughout
the region are
rising up against the global corporate elite and claiming
their rights and natural resources as their own, from Bolivia to Ecuador to
Venezuela. This is another factor driving the endangered oligarchy into
resorting to military desperation.
The military coup in Honduras, the attempted
coup in Venezuela, and the failed attempt to provoke Columbia and Venezuela
into an armed conflict all clearly indicate where this situation is headed
if the imperialist bankers get their way.
The average American is dreadfully unaware of just how depraved these people
are.
The little regard they have for human life is
beyond common comprehension.
VIII - Private
Military Complex
The global elite have already used the War on Terror as a pretext to
drastically increase military spending and build a massive private military
and intelligence complex on the backs of the American taxpayer.
According to an extensive report from the
Washington Post, a stunning
1.2 million private contractors work in this
complex. Most Americans are not aware that
69 percent of the soldiers
deployed in our name are private contractors, and 80 percent of them are
foreign nationals, meaning they are not even from the United States.
Half of the people we have deployed in our name,
who are funded by our tax dollars, are not even fighting for our country,
they are fighting for a paycheck.
Wars are a highly profitable racket, which gives an enormous incentive to
keep them going. This is one of the reasons why the war in Afghanistan is
now the longest war in US history. This system has led to a perpetual state
of war.
Military spending, although widely reported as
being around
$680 billion per year, is more accurately totaling
over $1
Trillion per year. Of this staggering amount of annual spending, 25 percent
of it goes unaccounted for, not counting the billions of our tax dollars
lost to over-charging and
all-out fraud.
This private military complex has become so
out of control that politicians
are now forced to admit that they have no idea what is happening within it.
As the Washington Post report revealed:
The top-secret world the government created
in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has become so
large, so unwieldy and so secretive that no one knows how much money it
costs, how many people it employs, how many programs exist within it or
exactly how many agencies do the same work.
These are some of the findings of a two-year investigation by The
Washington Post that discovered what amounts to an alternative geography
of the United States, a Top Secret America hidden from public view and
lacking in thorough oversight.
After nine years of unprecedented
spending and growth, the result is that the system put in place to keep
the United States safe is so massive that its effectiveness is
impossible to determine.
The investigations other findings include:
Some 1,271 government organizations and
1,931 private companies work on programs related to
counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000
locations across the United States.
An estimated 854,000 people, nearly 1.5
times as many people as live in Washington, D.C., hold top-secret
security clearances.
There are so many unaccountable cells and
competing factions within this complex, any one of them could go rogue and
launch an attack on the US soil and make it look like another terrorist
organization or nation executed it.
This may sound too conspiratorial to the casual
observer, but it would be stunningly naïve to think that in a massive
complex like this, with so little oversight and accountability, given the
huge sums of money at stake, that something tragic wouldnt eventually
occur. The implications are ominous, to say the least.
We already had a proven act of internal domestic terror occur with the
Anthrax attacks in 2001.
It is not a stretch to think that any moves away
from a state of permanent war, and any cut to military spending that would
threaten the existence of many of the worlds largest and most powerful and
profitable corporations, would result in an attack in hopes of inciting a
military conflict.
Former President Dwight Eisenhowers warning
against the unwarranted influence of the military industrial complex, and
the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power pales in
comparison to the modern private military complex.
While many of these companies currently rely on
US tax dollars, they are not part of the government, they are global private
entities with their own interests at heart, similar to the Federal Reserve
banking system. In fact, when you peel back the layers, many of these
private military companies are funded by the global banking cartel.
When you understand the forces behind war, you must acknowledge the words of
famed two-time Congressional Medal of Honor recipient US Brigadier General
Smedley D. Butler.
He accurately summed up the situation when he
said:
I spent 33 years in the Marines, most of my
time being a high-class muscle man for big business, for Wall Street and
the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer for Capitalism
The general
public shoulders the bill. This bill renders a horrible accounting.
Newly placed gravestones, Mangled bodies. Shattered minds. Broken hearts
and homes. Economic instability. Back-breaking taxation for generations
and generations.
To give just two brief examples of how the
banking cartel operates behind the scenes during wars, consider the
following. The genocidal carnage in Northern Africa that killed over
5.4
million people was enthusiastically supported by the IMF and World Bank.
In a news report entitled, The Business of War
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dena Montague and Frida
Berrigan explained:
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
World Bank have knowingly contributed to the war effort. The
international lending institutions praised both Rwanda and Uganda for
increasing their gross domestic product (GDP), which resulted from the
illegal mining of DRC resources.
Although the IMF and World Bank were aware
that the rise in GDP coincided with the DRC war
they nonetheless touted
both nations as economic success stories
In another example of grotesque profiting off
massive levels of death, banking cartel members made a fortune on the
production of cluster bombs.
The Guardian revealed
the details:
The deadly trade in cluster bombs is funded
by the worlds biggest banks who have loaned or arranged finance worth
$20bn to firms producing the controversial weapons, despite growing
international efforts to ban them.
HSBC
has profited more than any other institution from companies that
manufacture cluster bombs. The British bank
has earned a total of
£657.3m in fees arranging bonds and share offerings for Textron, which
makes cluster munitions
Campaigners maintain the deadly weapons can
explode years after combat, killing or maiming innocent people
Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JP Morgan and UK-based Barclays Bank are
also named among the worst banks [funding the production of cluster
bombs]
.
Goldman Sachs, the US bank which made £3.19bn profit in just three
months, earned $588.82m for bank services and lent $250m to [cluster
bomb manufactures] Alliant Techsystems and Textron.
To sum all of this up, the global banking cartel
and private military complex are a runaway virus that demands a permanent
state of warfare.
They are intrinsically parasitic in nature, they
have devolved into a fascist enterprise that survives and profits off of
destruction. If they dont get a war, they will create one in the interest
of their own self preservation.
As former CIA Station Chief John Stockwell
once explained:
Enemies are necessary for the wheels of the
US military machine to turn.
This insight can now be extended to the global
banking cartel. Enemies are now necessary for the wheels of the global
banking cartel to turn.
Under the cover of the War on Terror they have launched a massive campaign
of violence abroad and have been systematically looting our economy and
stripping of us civil liberties at home.
So as the US and global population becomes more radical, and as the
environment becomes more hostile, with increasingly limited natural
resources, in a desperate attempt to maintain power the global banking
cartel will escalate from economic attacks to worldwide military-based
assaults.
This is the clear path we are on - the road to
World War III.
IX - History Repeats
Itself
History Repeats Itself, Coiling
Down Into the Future.
Natural Born Killers
This may very well be a case of history
repeating itself. Not to oversimplify an extremely complex situation, but
this is all too similar to the origins of World War II.
The looting of the masses by an unaccountable
Wall Street elite led to the Great Depression and set the conditions for
WWII. Desperate and impoverished populations increasingly supported more and
more extreme leaders. The conditions are now so ripe for world war that
Noam Chomsky has convincingly compared modern-day America to
Weimar Germany prior
to the outbreak of WWII.
Research the history of pre-war societies and
you will see for yourself how our current political environment fits
historical precedent like a glove.
As mentioned before, the roots of our current crisis can be directly traced
back to the aftermath of World War II. In the ruins of WWII grew global
institutions like the IMF and World Bank. It also gave us the National
Security Act and the CIA. All were central and pivotal in creating the
crisis which we are now confronted with.
After analyzing our current crisis and studying well-established historical
precedents, one must conclude that creating a world war is the last card the
global bankers have left to play, other than conceding power, and history
has taught us that the ruling class never concedes power. Of course the
one-tenth of one percent of the global population hoarding our wealth could
give back a significant amount of the
$39 Trillion they looted from us (not
counting what they have hidden in offshore accounts).
That would certainly go a long way to fixing the
crisis they have caused, but again, the ruling class has never conceded
power, no matter how excessive and ill-gotten their gains.
So brace yourself
unless we significantly change our present course, we are
on the road to World War III.
