Everyone in the world seems to recognize the
obvious crimes perpetrated by the Bush/Cheney regime.
Their overwhelming negative status in the world
has now confined them to personal prisons where they can no longer travel
abroad for public events. It appears they're only welcome in heavily-secured
private dragon lairs for the rest of their waking years.
But even those
locations are shrinking for these torturers and mass murderers.
Cheney, scheduled to speak in Toronto with his daughter next month, had to
cancel the speaking appearance due to,
"security concerns stemming from their
experiences in Vancouver in September 2011," according to a press release
about the event.
The September event referred to in the press release was hardly a public
event at all.
It cost $500 a ticket to attend and took place at the
Vancouver Club which the
Canadian Press called,
"one of Vancouver's most
exclusive clubs."
Still, the public caught wind of the event and staged a
rambunctious protest calling for Cheney's arrest. The angry crowd caused
Cheney to be locked in the club for seven hours longer than he was
scheduled.
In February of last year,
George W. Bush had to
cancel a speaking engagement
in Switzerland because human rights groups put pressure on the Swiss
government to arrest him over torture allegations if he enters the country.
Even though officials claimed Bush had diplomatic immunity because he was a
former head of state, they recognized that torture is a legitimate crime
under international law. Organizers of the event felt the "atmosphere had
become too threatening" and the gala went on without Bush.
Since Bush left office he has traveled outside the United States on two
occasions with former president
Bill Clinton. The first was a 2010 trip to
Haiti after the devastating earthquake where he made a complete fool of
himself.
After shaking hands with a desperate survivor he
scowled in disgust and
wiped his hand on Clinton's shoulder as if it was
covered in filth:
The second trip chaperoned by Clinton was to British Columbia, Canada for
the Regional Economic Summit this past October where Amnesty International
and Human Rights Watch
called for his arrest citing his involvement in
authorizing torture:
There is overwhelming evidence that Bush and other senior administration
officials authorized and implemented a regime of torture and ill-treatment
of hundreds of detainees in US custody, including at least two Canadian
citizens.
Under the Convention Against Torture, Canada is obligated to
prosecute individuals suspected of committing torture found in its territory
if other countries have failed to do so.
That trip was preceded by another event where Bush was to attend a private
breakfast at an evangelical university, also in Canada, but
was abruptly
canceled due to a backlash of student protests.
In November 2011, a symbolic tribunal in Malaysia made up of the country's
former premier and a former federal judge among others, found George W. Bush
and UK's Tony Blair
guilty of war crimes.
The evidence showed that the
drums of wars were being beaten long before the invasion. The accused in
their own memoirs have admitted their own intention to invade Iraq
regardless of international law, it concluded.
Although the Malaysia tribunal isn't officially binding as an arrest
warrant, it shows the sentiment that is building around the world for
calling these Western leaders what they are:
international "child killers"
and "war criminals."
All of these stories seem to indicate that the circles where these murderers
are still welcomed are getting smaller and smaller. Whether they will ever
be actually tried for their crimes remains to be seen.
But one thing is for
sure, every time they venture out of their undisclosed bunkers, they get
shoved right back in by angry mobs of humanitarians seeking justice for
their wickedness.
