It would be hard to contest that our world is in
crisis, or at least at a turning point.
The models which were developed at the start of
the industrial revolution have either failed or are crumbling in front of us
in real time. If communism died in the 80â€²s with the collapse of the
Soviet Union, capitalism is now on life support. Nothing was revolutionary
about the industrial revolution, but instead the industrial leviathan
enslaved workers and started destroying our ecosystem by its immense
appetite for resources and for burning energy.
The ruling transnational elites, either in the corporate, financial or
political sectors, are now operating outside national boundaries with
complete disregard for local populations.
To an American businessman, it
doesnt matter if his home town is experiencing double digit unemployment if
he can find a cheaper way to fabricate a product in China or India. Workers
in both China and India are paid meager wages, which barely allow them to
survive but allow the Chinese or Indian counterpart of the US businessman to
become wealthy in the process.
Globalization has made capitalism into a
destructive machine of wealth concentration without any concerns for the
worker bees producing the wealth, and for the damage it creates to our
environment by draining our resources.
Global Food Crisis
The Gathering Of A Perfect Storm
The global food crisis is expected to get worse in 2011.
It is due to
speculation on commodities and land, climate change and overpopulation.
Worldwide we have now some major systemic problems on both sides of the food
scarcity equation: supply and demand. Both parameters are driving up food
prices.
On the demand side the main factors responsible are commodities and land
speculation by global financial markets, a demographic explosion and the use
of crops for fuel. On the supply side, the loss of crop land to non-farming
activities, diversion of water to city areas and climate change, with its
heat waves and floods, are already taking a dramatic toll on our ability to
produce more food.
What global capitalism, both at the level of governments and of corporate
mega-players, should do (but wont) for its own survival is to redefine
security, and shift spending from military and policing purposes to
investing in solutions to really tackle the emergency of
climate change,
water scarcity and overpopulation.
The path that we are currently following
is unsustainable and is likely, like it did in Tunisia, to fuel social
unrest against national and transnational ruling elites.
Tunisias Revolution
Effect
Igniting A Pan-Arabic Secular Uprising For Democracy
There is no more doubt that Tunisias Jasmine Revolution is not only likely
to succeed, but is also spreading quickly through the region like wildfire.
Today, a Tunisian general, Rachid Ammar, who refused to back dictator Ben
Alis crackdown on protesters, vowed to protect the revolution as the
transition government is going through a major reshuffle to exclude elements
of Ben Alis regime.
General Ammar, who is hugely popular in Tunisia for his
role in ousting Ben Ali, said that the Tunisian army would act as guarantor
of the Revolution.
Our revolution, your revolution, the revolution of the young risks being
lost. There are forces that are calling for a void, a power vacuum, General
Ammar told a cheering crowd speaking through a megaphone.
On Saturday,
thousands marched to the capital Tunis in what they called a caravan of
liberation. Protesters want anybody affiliated with Ben Alis regime out of
the government.
You stole the wealth of the country, but you are not going
to steal the revolution, chanted the demonstrators.
The contagion of the Tunisian uprising has already ramifications in
Algeria, Yemen and Jordan by inspiring popular protests.
On Tuesday, it will
be the turn of Egypt where Egyptian organizers are trying to start their
version of the Tunisian revolution, and are calling it:
The day of
revolution against torture, poverty, corruption and unemployment.
Meanwhile, protests by self-immolation or other public suicides are daily
occurrences In Egypt and Algeria.
A big rally is called for tomorrow in
Cairo and Alexandria, and organizers are on social media sites such as Facebook challenging Egyptians to stand up like their Tunisian brothers.
On
January 25, we have to show the world that we are not a cowardly submissive
people. We are not less than Tunisians, said one of the organizers.
WikiLeaks And Social
Media
Information And Activism Gone Viral Fuel The Global
Revolution
In the last couple of years we had globally a few mishaps where hope for
change and reforms were squashed before they could blossom.
It was of course
the Green movement in Iran, the Red Shirts in Thailand, and social unrest in
Greece in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Many activists in
Iran and elsewhere are trying to keep what could have been a new revolution
in Iran alive using social media such as Twitter and Facebook. It is the
same with the Red Shirts in Thailand, and the anti-globalization and the
anti-capitalism movement in Europe.
But so far, in either case, political activists have failed to make these
movements gel.
However, it doesnt mean that the respective failures in
Iran, Thailand and Europe are permanent setbacks, it could just be an issue
of timing. One of the key ingredients for success still largely missing in
the attempts was WikiLeaks.
What WikiLeaks did, and will keep doing regardless of
Julian Assanges fate,
was to make an astronomical amount of information, kept secret by
governments, widely available to the public worldwide.
For example,
Tunisians found out from the leaked US State Department cables that Ben Ali
was hosting lavish dinners at one of his mini-palaces where fancy French ice
cream was served after being shipped, by air, on one of Ben Alis private
jets.
In two days, the global governmental and transnational corporate elite will
be meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The 2011 thematic for Davos masters of
the universe is to reflect and discuss Shared norms for the new reality.
The
global elite will chew the fat (more likely the caviar and oysters)
and will be asked by the organizers to ponder on,
the fact that we live in a
world that is becoming increasingly complex and interconnected, but also
experiencing an erosion of common values and principle.
However, they should reflect on the fact that they could shortly be in a
precarious situation.
It is both ironic and insulting for the organizers to
mention an erosion of common values and principles when they clearly
belong to the very small group of people plundering the worlds resources
and wealth. Only profit matters for global capitalism, not conscience or
even real analytical abilities.
The global elite should reflect on the
gathering storm on the horizon, and what could become the overwhelming power
of the many versus the few.
The ingredients are accumulating to make a
successful recipe for a global, and hopefully semi-peaceful, revolution.
