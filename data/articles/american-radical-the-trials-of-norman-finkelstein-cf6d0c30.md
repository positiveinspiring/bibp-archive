American Radical is the
probing, definitive documentary about Jewish-American political scientist
Norman Finkelstein.
A devoted son of holocaust survivors, an ardent critic of Israel and US
Middle East policy, Finkelstein has been steadfast at the centre of many
intractable controversies, including his denial of tenure at
DePaul
University.
Called a lunatic and self-hating Jew by some and an inspirational
street-fighting revolutionary by others, Finkelstein is a deeply polarizing
figure.
From Beirut to Kyoto, the filmmakers follow Finkelstein around the world as
he attempts to negotiate a voice among both supporters and critics.
