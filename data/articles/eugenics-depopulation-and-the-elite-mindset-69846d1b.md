Let's suppose the elitist scum working to ruin and control our lives and
planet are in some fashion real people to some extent.
I know, a stretch, but let's try.
-
So how can they perpetrate such horrors
on humanity?
-
How could such madness be justified in
the minds of men, however psychopathic?
Actually, it's easy.
For self promotion, preservation and power
they've convinced themselves that what they are perpetrating is the right
thing to do. But what's their fundamental tenet for mass murder?
Everything they think and believe is a fabricated bastardization and
reversal of any real Truth, but in their minds they've decided this wicked,
inhuman illuminist takeover makes sense. Especially with their fat cheeks
being firmly ensconced in the seats of power.
Oh, the vestiges of their human conscience may give some of them a
nudge in some cases, but it's been shut down almost completely for most of
them. It has to be. You can't have empathy and wreak such death dealing
havoc on nature and humanity.
If you've ever known or observed a pathological liar, this cauterized
mindset is their way of life. Politicians do it without the slightest
compunction. To them it's part of the job description for ruling the
unwashed masses.
How is it justified logically? The old
"necessary evil" ruse, as in the justification
for
9/11 and myriad of other actions...
The even more amazing thing is that they smugly revel in this ugliness,
thinking they're the "good guys".
Convincing the Cattle
to Die - Eugenics Justifies All
Think about it...
What a slam dunk for world domination to so
twist perception to where humanity is the problem that needs to be curtailed
by draconian controls while being systematically exterminated like a pest
infestation.
Be it,
-
engineered wars, poverty and food
shortages
-
drugging, corrupted food, and water
-
dumbed down information and media, or
injecting toxins in our bodies,
...all is fair game to them.
Eugenics is the "tie that binds", the glue
that holds all the other lies conveniently together. And it takes the sting
out of outright mass murder. For them. It's a "cleaning" and "preparation"
for their desired world to come.
Look what
Agenda 21
controls are perpetrated via things like climate change and CO2
fabrications.
Sure, we're in the throes of massive climate
extremes for many reasons, many of them geo-engineered, but to blame it on
cattle flatulence and human breathing must be some kind of macabre inside
joke.
Bottom line is they are planning a great "culling
of the herd" and need our permission. We've read about it for
decades in their elitist writings, and this is how they justify it and hope
to convince us as much as possible of the same. That's the alert.
Remember, not waking up and saying no is ultimately humanity's imprimatur
that it agrees. That's where empowerment comes in. We can say no and
reverse all this, just as we've done in many instances.
But the awakened shout out needs to be immediate
and insistent.
A Little Background
As eugenics, called the "self-direction of human evolution", grew out of its
inception in the 1800's, it was considered the harmonious result of all
branches of science.
The US was the first to implement eugenics
programs as early as 1908 and it gained a lot of popularity and traction.
What stopped it in its tracks, at least in
public opinion, was the Nazi implementation of eugenics during WW2 to the
obvious horror of all, however backed by the American program and
exaggerated
by Zionists.
This would later turn out to be an amazingly cunning pre-planned propaganda
tool as we'll discuss below.
But now look how this eugenics campaign has been revived and is currently
perpetrated. With innocuous sounding names like Planned Parenthood to
the United Nations' dastardly Agenda 21, the mass hive mind
sees these measures as "progress" while knowing little to nothing about the
extensive anti-human nevermind anti-freedom measures being foisted upon
them.
And it's not just genetic culling, it's mass population reduction.
An elitist think tank called
The Club of Rome set the latest stage for
this last push to demonize humanity with the contrived invention of
militant, invasive environmentalism. This appeared around the same time as
the widely sensationalized "population bomb" concept.
While real ecology and conservationism make
common sense, this environmental agenda was created with the specific
intention to foist massive controls over human activities. That we're now at
the incredulous point of having to pay a literal carbon tax is a total
giveaway of their fraudulent intentions.
Yet few catch on.
And again, like the lie of human caused
global warming, we should feel guilty for
being alive, to such an extent that even our breath is supposedly killing
the planet. Insane...
Yet they keep pushing their agenda regardless of
real scientific data to the contrary.
The Cauterized Mind of
Dystopians
While humanity doesn't share the bestial mindset of the elites and their
occult driven agenda, these pounding programs wear on people. Over time the
continued onslaught of these nonsensical anti-truths start to wear a groove
in the mass mind.
The psycho-trauma tool of choice?
Cognitive dissonance...
Resistance subsides as seemingly contrary understandings-in this case,
"I'm a sovereign human being who deserves
life and freedom" vs. "I'm a parasitic organism killing my host planet
and need to be eradicated".
Screwy, but that's what it boils down to.
And what gets synthesized in the mind to reconcile the two?
"I guess they know what they're doing. Gee,
we are bad and something needs to be done."
It doesn't really make sense so the overload
causes a shutdown and back to the TV and ball game they go, acquiescing by
apathy.
Once again, the intended solution being foisted on society gains traction.
And daring to oppose this new status-quo? It has now been cleverly
engineered to be tantamount to terrorism, the ultimate behavioral catch-all.
Game. Set. Match
or so they think.
Zio-Kabbalism - An
Identifiable Virus Form
While the arrogant, intellectual roots of modern eugenics seem to escape
mainstream consciousness, obvious forms of racism and genocidal
extermination, as recently exposed in the latest Gaza genocide, have been
much more evident.
That the two are intrinsically connected takes
one to the much deeper understanding of what's really going on on this
planet - the elimination of more conscious and rooted indigenous forms of
humanity and the subjugation of the remaining human race and its ultimate
manipulation into a non-questioning subservient form actually loving its
enslavement.
Yes, just like the predictive programming evidenced in literature and film
making for centuries.
The
Zionist mindset with its Kabbalistic occult
sense of supremacism is a clear example of justified extermination of
"lesser" beings. An incredible "in your face" example that the world turns a
blind eye to.
Instead, they fall for the big lie created by
the engineered German holocaust that the perpetrators of this current
extermination of their "inferiors" as manifested in the millions of killed
and displaced Palestinians, is somehow because the killers are the potential
victims.
That's how they work. Manipulate history and pound
the
manipulated message home via propaganda.
That simple - as long as you have a complicit
media and engorging codependent governments. Behold the birth of the Zionist
parasite called Israel. A perfect example of the sick fruits of eugenically
driven, ravenous psychotic behavior,
When people wake up to that mechanism blood will run hot and heavy and
they'll get their due. They always have and always will. Evil dies from its
own corrupted aberration.
As in the human body, the protective immune
system of the Universe will eventually disable and recycle these invaders.
The Interdimensional
Connection
In a Universe of boundless life and energy we know entities of all types
exist, which even so-called modern scientists affirm.
Dimensions abound beyond ours and they're
here and interacting with our world.
This reality must play heavily into our personal understanding of our
interdimensional cosmos. We're a world under siege, and we need to know our
enemies as well as our friends.
That such forces of darkness can mount such a
profoundly coordinated attack on a planet of mainly meek, loving inhabitants
reeks of opportunity for an aggressive force.
I don't know exactly what's going on but I hope
this helps present the case for what we're potentially up against.
Inter-dimensional war.
I would be remiss without pointing out these
otherworldly influences on our three
dimensional experience.
There is much more than meets the physical eye
as we well know. People are driven by many influences, and spiritual ones
are the most profound.
Religions dutifully categorize such
concepts as good and bad influences, while metaphysics
dissects these various aspects with intrigue.
Psychic, transcendental and after death
phenomena also abound.
So please don't tell me there's nothing more than this observable world.
The Antidote -
Disengage and Live in Truth and Love
Never give in mentally or spiritually to this onslaught.
While we need to stay active in exposing their
perfidy, we cannot be part of their ensnaring mindset.
That's why turning off all forms of mainstream media is so important. That's
why immersion in positive influences, nature, and loving people to counter
these types of realities is so important.
Anyone in their right mind knows this kind of plan cannot succeed in the
long run. We happen to be at a time in history where these negative,
barbaric influences are peaking with the acceleration of hijacked
technologies.
This too shall pass. But we should be vigilant and prepare as best we can,
without fear. It's a time to grow in consciousness and communication with
each other so we can share our combined knowledge, insights and loving
support.
Therein is life, one day at a time.
As it always is...
