The US continues to militarize much of Latin
America, spending enormous amounts of cash in order to prop up obedient
regimes, train armies and militias, build new military bases, deploy more
troops, and keep the military industrial complex fat and happy.
In the most expensive initiative in Latin
America since the Cold War,
reports the Associated Press, the US has militarized the battle
against the traffickers, spending more than $20 billion in the past
decade.
US Army troops, Air Force pilots and Navy
ships outfitted with Coast Guard counternarcotics teams are routinely
deployed to chase, track and capture drug smugglers, while Washington
is simultaneously training not only law enforcement agents in Latin
American nations, but their militaries as well, building a network of
expensive hardware, radar, airplanes, ships, runways and refueling
stations, and justifying it all under the
drug war.
The US is building new military bases in,
-
Guatemala
-
Panama
-
Belize
-
Honduras
-
the Dominican Republic
-
Peru,
...and elsewhere.
Hundreds of millions of US taxpayer dollars go
to militarizing the region for the benefit of Washington and its corporate
collaborators, but it ends up in some very nasty places.
John Lindsay-Poland at FOR,
details some of the human rights abusers Washington is currently
supporting:
The US Southern Command (SouthCom),
responsible for US military activities in Central and South America and
the Caribbean, is assisting the Panamanian border police, known as SENAFRONT,
by upgrading a building in the SENAFRONT compound.
The force was implicated in killings
of indigenous protesters in Bocas del Toro in 2011
and fired
indiscriminately with live ammunition on Afro-Caribbean
protesters last October (all in Panama).
And even though there is legislation that bans
most State Department-channeled military aid to the army in Guatemala, the
ban curiously does not apply to Defense Department assistance, and US
military aid to Guatemala has increased more than seven times since 2009.
The contracts included new assistance to the
Guatemalan special forces, known as Kaibiles, former members of which
have been implicated in giving training to the Zetas drug cartel, as
well as the worst atrocities during the genocide period of the 1980s.
Two contracts, funded by SouthCom and signed
in September, were for a "shoot
house" and "improvements" at
the Kaibiles training base in Poptun, Petén.
In addition, Lindsay-Poland writes,
the US military spent another $8.1 million on fuel in Guatemala last
year, probably for Beyond the Horizon military exercises held there
and in Honduras from April to July, and perhaps to support the
deployment of 200 Marines to Guatemala in August.
The US has recently expanded its mission in
Honduras, referred to as
Operation Anvil.
It is run with six State Department attack
helicopters and a special team of commando-style Drug Enforcement
Administration agents who have now been implicated along with Honduran
security forces in the killing of innocent Hondurans on several occasions.
In June, a group of academics from around Latin
America plus the US wrote a
letter to the State Department protesting against the US military
presence in Honduras and demanding that aid to the countrys abusive law
enforcement apparatus be halted.
They exposed the drug war as the farce it is,
charging,
we are the ones providing all the corpses
in your war and arguing that combatting drug trafficking is not a
legitimate justification for the US to fund and train security forces
that usurp democratic governments and violently repress our people.
And when Washington isnt giving its support and
training to human rights abusers, its military spending in the region
exclusively helps the corporate entities in the military industrial complex.
Lindsay-Poland:
Many countries that host US military
activities hope to receive economic benefits and jobs as a result. But
more than five of every six Pentagon dollars contracted for services and
goods in the region went to US-based companies.
Only nine percent of the $574.4 million in
Pentagon contracts signed in 2012 (including fuel contracts) were with
firms in the country where the work was to be carried out. In the
Caribbean, there were virtually no local companies that benefitted from
the $245 million in Defense Department contracts.
The US has a lengthy record of savage military
interventionism and support for mass murderers in Central and South America.
The
Obama administration has dramatically
increased this long historical trend. One is tempted to point out how
ineffective it has been under the stated drug war justifications, given that
such approaches have only bolstered the black market drug trade.
But the truth is, this approach is incredibly
effective in keeping obedient regimes in place, maintaining
geo-political/economic/military dominance in the region, and deepening the
pockets of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and countless other corporate welfare
queens.
Pentagon Continues Contracting U.S. Companies in...
Latin America

The Pentagon signed $444 million in non-fuel
contracts for purchases and services in Latin America and the Caribbean
during the 2012 fiscal year, an overall decrease of nearly 15% from the
previous year.
But US military
spending in the region is still considerably higher than during the
George
W. Bush administration, when the equivalent Pentagon spending in Latin
America averaged $301 million a year.
FOR
conducted an analysis of Defense Department contracts listed on
usaspending.gov for Fiscal Year 2012, building on
the review we did last year.
More than a third of funds for these contracts
in the region are being carried out in Cuba, with $158 million for housing
upgrades, intelligence analysis, port operations and other services.
The United States maintains the Guantanamo naval
base in Cuba, site of the 11-year-old detention center that holds 171
prisoners without trial, many of whom have been cleared for release.
An additional $130 million in Pentagon contracts
was for fuel purchases, including,
Such fuel purchases
supply the Fourth Fleet of the Navy, as well as military aircraft and land
vehicles used in exercises, operations, and training.
Colombia remained the country with the largest
amount of Pentagon contracts in continental Latin America, with $77 million.
A multi-year contract shared by Raytheon and Lockheed for training,
equipment and other
drug war activities accounted for more than a third of
Pentagon contract spending in Colombia.
Honduras, which has become a hub for Pentagon
operations in Central America, is the site for more than $43 million in
non-fuel contracts signed last year.
The US Southern Command (SouthCom),
responsible for US military activities in Central and South America and
the Caribbean, is assisting the Panamanian border police, known as SENAFRONT,
by upgrading a building in the SENAFRONT compound.
The force was implicated in killings
of indigenous protesters in Bocas del Toro in 2011
and fired
indiscriminately with live ammunition on Afro-Caribbean
protesters last October.
Many countries that host US
military activities hope to receive economic benefits and jobs as a result.
But more than five of every six Pentagon dollars contracted for services and
goods in the region went to US-based companies.
Only nine percent of the $574.4 million in
Pentagon contracts signed in 2012 (including fuel contracts) were with firms
in the country where the work was to be carried out. In the Caribbean, there
were virtually no local companies that benefitted from the $245 million in
Defense Department contracts.
A few corporations dominated Pentagon contracts
in the region. CSC Applied Technologies, based in
Fort Worth, Texas, received more than $53 million in contracts to operate
the Navys underwater military testing facility in the Bahamas.
Lockheed Martin received more than $40 million
in contracts, almost entirely for drug war training, equipment and services
in Colombia and Mexico.
Pentagon Focus on Guatemala
Although the Pentagon spent less in most
Latin American countries in 2012 than the year before,
DOD contracts have more than doubled since 2010 in Guatemala, where
there is a ban on most State Department-channeled military aid to the army.
However, the ban does not apply to Defense
Department assistance. The contracts for nearly $14 million in 2012 amount
to more than seven times what it was in 2009.
In addition, the US
military spent another $8.1 million on fuel in Guatemala last year, probably
for Beyond the Horizon military exercises held there and in Honduras from
April to July, and perhaps to support
the deployment of 200 Marines
to Guatemala in August.
The contracts included new assistance to the
Guatemalan special forces, known as Kaibiles, former members of which have
been implicated in giving training to the Zetas drug cartel, as well as the
worst atrocities during the genocide period of the 1980s. Two contracts,
funded by SouthCom and signed in September, were for a "shoot
house" and "improvements"
at the Kaibiles training base in Poptun, Petén.
SouthCom also funded a contract for
construction of
a new $3 million counter-drug base in Santa Ana de Berlin, in
Quetzaltenango. This year, SouthCom is slated to build a $1.8 million
counternarcotics operations center and barracks in Mantanitas, Guatemala,
according to
an Army Corps of Engineers presentation.
The expenditures included equipment. For the
last two years, SouthCom has been providing Boston whaler boats, radios, and
tactical vehicles (Jeeps) to Central American militaries.
Guatemala is receiving more of the equipment
than other countries in the region - 47 Jeeps and 8 Boston whalers,
according to
a SouthCom document. SouthCom signed a $2.5 million contract in
September for Jeeps for Guatemala, and it has purchased more than $2.8
million of Harris military radios for Guatemala since September 2011.
Department of Defense contracts, summaries of
which are posted on usaspending.gov, only represent a portion of Pentagon
spending.
A
report to Congress last April of Defense Department assistance worldwide
showed more than $15 million in military aid to Guatemala in 2010, including
$9 million for intelligence analysis, training, boats, trucks, night vision
devices, and a base of operations.
These funds also included more than $6 million
of unspecified support for Guatemalan police operations in Cobán, in the
Guatemalan highland department of Alta Verapaz. The report didnt include
data after 2010.
On December 7, the Pentagons Defense
Logistics Agency
signed a $1.4 million contract
with a Guatemalan firm to manage a 10,000-barrel supply of turbine fuel for
the next five years in Puerto Quetzal, on Guatemalas southern coast.
This followed
a July 2012 solicitation to deliver 63,000 gallons of jet fuel to
another southern Guatemalan site, in Retalhuleu.
FOR
compiled data on the country of performance for contracts. For Guatemala,
we also examined data on additional contracts that reference the country,
which included
a $2.5 million contract signed in late September with a Chrysler
distributor to deliver tactical vehicles - some of the Jeeps slated for the
country.
The US Army also
purchased $7.6 million worth of trousers from a producer in Guatemala
in 2012.
Mini-Bases
Some legislation for DOD
drug war construction of bases and other infrastructure limits projects to
$2 million, and the Southern Command continues to employ this authority
frequently to construct a variety of facilities all over the Americas.
Here are some of the facilities the
US military is constructing around Latin America:
