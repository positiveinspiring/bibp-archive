The Global Peace Index 2017, which bases its annual assessment on a complex analysis of social, economic, and political factors, has found that the United States of America is the 114th most peaceful nation on the planet.
This most recent ranking sees the U.S. down 11 places from the previous year.
This drop places Armenia and Rwanda in front of America, and El Salvador and China right behind. (have a read about the conflict in Rwanda if you have the time).
"Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Portugal, Austria, and Denmark. There was also very little change at the bottom of the index. Syria remains the least peaceful country in the world, followed by Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, and Yemen," the report said.

Considering recent current events, it may come as a surprise to some that Syria wasn't always at the bottom of the list - and we have the 114th most peaceful country to blame for this dilemma.
In 2008, Syria was ranked 75th - following eight years of Bashar al-Assad's rule, as well as the rule of his father for 29 years beforehand. The other countries at the bottom of the list (including Syria) are actively being bombed into oblivion by the United States.
So what could be behind America's own deterioration, given it prefers to take its conflict thousands of miles away from its own soil?
"The U.S. deterioration is primarily driven by the growing intensity of internal conflict within the country, which was partly seen in the divisive 2016 Presidential election, as well as increases in the perceptions of criminality across American society," the analysis said.
According to the Global Peace Index's latest findings, most of America's allies are ranked within the top 20 places in the rankings, including Canada, Japan, Australia, and Germany.
The United Kingdom is placed somewhat lower, ranking 41st.
Israel is ranked 144th (behind Philippines, Egypt, Kenya and Western archrival Iran, to name a few).
