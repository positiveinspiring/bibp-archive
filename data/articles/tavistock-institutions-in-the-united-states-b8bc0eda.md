-
FLOW LABORATORIES
Gets contracts from the National Institute of Health.
-
MERLE THOMAS CORPORATION
Gets contracts from the U.S. Navy, analyzes data from satellites.
-
WALDEN RESEARCH
Does work in the field of pollution control.
-
PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION, ARTHUR D. LITTLE, G.E. TEMPO,
OPERATIONS RESEARCH INC.
Part of approximately 350 firms who
conduct research and conduct surveys, make recommendations to
government. They are part of what President Eisenhower called a
possible
danger to public policy that could itself become captive of a
scientific-technological elite.
-
BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
Dedicates its work to what it calls a national agenda. Wrote
President Hoovers program, President Roosevelts New Deal, the
Kennedy Administrations New Frontiers program (deviation from it
cost John F. Kennedy his life), and President Johnsons Great
Society. Brookings has been telling the United States Government
how to conduct its affairs for the past 70 years and is still doing
so on behalf of
the Committee of 300.
-
HUDSON INSTITUTE
Under the direction of
Herman Khan, this institution has done more to shape the way
Americans react to political and social events, think, vote and
generally conduct themselves than perhaps any except the BIG
FIVE. Hudson specializes in defense policy research and
relations with the USSR. Most of its military work is classified as
SECRET. (One idea during the Vietnam War was to build a moat around
Saigon.) Some of its earlier papers were entitled Stability and
Tranquility Among Older Nations, and Analytical Summary of U.S.
National Security Policy Issues.
Hudson prides itself on its diversity; it helped NASA with its space
programs and helped to promote new youth fashions and ideas, youth
rebellion and alienation for the Committee of 300, ostensibly funded
by Coca Cola. Hudson may be quite properly classified as one of the
Committee of 300s BRAIN-WASHING establishments. Some of its nuclear
war scenarios make for very interesting reading and, if they can be
obtained, I would recommend The 6 Basic Thermonuclear Threats and
Possible Outcomes of Thermonuclear War and one of its more
frightening papers entitled Israeli-Arab Nuclear War.
Hudson also does corporate advising for
Committee of 300 companies,
Rank, Xerox, General Electric, IBM and General Motors, to name but a
few of them, but its really big client remains the U. S. Department
of Defense which includes matters of civil defense, national
security, military policy and arms control. To date it has not got
into wet NASA, that is to say, the National Oceanographic Agency.

NATIONAL TRAINING LABORATORIES
NTL is also known as the International Institute for Applied
Behavioral Sciences. This institute is definitely a brainwashing
center based on Kurt Lewin principles which include so-called
T-Groups (training groups), artificial stress training whereby
participants suddenly find themselves immersed in defending
themselves against vicious accusations. NTL takes in the National
Education Association, the largest teacher-group in the United
States.
While officially decrying racism, it is interesting to note that
NTL, working with NEA, produced a paper proposing education vouchers
which would separate the hard-to-teach children from the brighter
ones, and funding would be allocated according to the number of
difficult children who would be separated from those who progressed
at a normal rate. The proposal was not taken up.

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, WHARTON
-
SCHOOL OF FINANCE & COMMERCE
Founded by Eric Trist, one of the brain trusts of
Tavistock,
Wharton has become one of the more important Tavistock institutions
in the U.S. in so far as Behavioral Research is concerned. Wharton
attracts clients such as the U.S. Department of Laborwhich it
teaches how to produce cooked statistics at the Wharton
Econometric Forecasting Associates Incorporated. This method is
very much in demand as we come to the close of 1991 with millions
more out of work than is reflected in USDL statistics.
Whartons ECONOMETRIC MODELING is used by every major
Committee of 300
company in the United States, Western Europe and by the
International Monetary Fund, the
United Nations and the
World Bank.
Wharton has produced such note-worthy persons as George Schultz and
Alan Greenspan.

INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH
This is the institute set up by brain trusters from
Tavistock
Rensis Likert, Dorwin Cartwright and Ronald Lippert. Among its
studies are:

institutes clients are

INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE
This is not a typical Tavistock institution in that it is funded by
the Ford Foundation, yet it draws its long-range forecasting
methodology from the mother of all think tanks. Institute for the
Future projects what it believes to be changes that will be taking
place in time frames of fifty years. The institute is supposed to be
able to forecast socioeconomic trends and to blow the whistle on any
departures from what it has laid down as normal.
Institute for the Future believes it is possible and normal to
intervene now and give decisions for the future. So-called Delphi
Panels decide what is normal and what is not, and prepare position
papers to steer government in the right direction to head off such
groups as people creating civil disorder.
(This could be patriotic
groups demanding abolition of graduated taxes, or demanding that
their right to bear arms is not infringed.)
The institute recommends actions such as liberalizing
abortion
laws, drug usage and that cars entering an urban area pay tolls,
teaching birth control in public schools, requiring registration of
firearms, making the use of drugs a non-criminal offense, legalizing
homosexuality, paying students for scholastic achievements, making
zoning controls a preserve of the state, offering bonuses for family
planning and last, but by no means least, a Pol Pot Cambodia-style
proposal that new communities be established in rural areas. As
will be observed, many of the Institute for the Futures goals have
already been more than fully realized.

INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES (IPS)
One of the Big Three, IPS has shaped and reshaped United
States policies, foreign and domestic, since it was founded by
James P. Warburg and the Rothschild entities in the United States,
bolstered by Bertrand Russell and the British Socialists through
its networks in America which include the League for Industrial
democracy in which Leonard Woodcock played a leading, if
behind-the-scenes role. Local lead players in the League for
Industrial Democracy included conservative Jeane Kirkpatrick,
Irwin Suall (of the ADL), Eugene Rostow (Arms Control negotiator),
Lane Kirkland (Labor leader), and Albert Shanker.
For record purposes only, IPS was incorporated in 1963 by
Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnett, both highly-trained Tavistock Institute
graduates. Most of the funding came from Rothschild associates in
America like the James Warburg Family, the Stern Family Foundation
and the Samuel Rubin Foundation. Samuel Rubin was a registered
member of the Communist Party who stole the Faberge name (Faberge
was Jeweler of the Imperial Russian Court) and made a fortune out
of the Faberge name.
The objectives of IPS came from an agenda laid down for it by the
British
Round Table, which agenda in turn came from
Travistock
Institute, one of the most notable being to create the New Left as
a grass roots movement in the U.S. IPS was to engender strife and
unrest and spread chaos like a wildfire out of control, proliferate
the ideals of left wing nihilistic socialism, support unrestricted
use of drugs of all types, and be the big stick with which to beat
the United States political establishment.
Barnett and Raskin controlled such diverse elements as,
-
the Black
Panthers
-
Daniel Ellsberg
-
National Security Council staff member Halperin
-
The Weathermen Underground
-
the Venceramos
-
the
campaign staff of candidate George McGovern
No scheme was too big
for IPS and its controllers to take on and manage.
Take the plot to kidnap Kissinger, which was in the hands
of Eqbal Ahmed, a British MI-6 intelligence agent of Pakistani
origin, laundered through TROTS (Trotskyite terrorists based
in London). The plot was discovered by the FBI so that it could not go too far. Ahmed went on to become the director of
one of IPSs most influential agencies, The Transnational Institute which, chameleon-like, changed from its former name,
Institute of Race Relations, when intelligence agents of BOSS
(Bureau of State Security) in South Africa unmasked the fact
that it was tied directly to Rhodes Scholarship-Harry Oppenheimer
and Anglo-American-British mining interests in South Africa. BOSS
also discredited the South Africa Foundation at the same time.
Through its many powerful lobbying groups on Capitol Hill, IPS
relentlessly used its big stick to beat Congress. IPS has a
network of lobbyists, all supposedly operating independently but in
actual fact acting cohesively, so that Congressmen are pummeled from
all sides by seemingly different and varied lobbyists. In this way,
IPS was, and is still, able to successfully sway individual
Representatives and Senators to vote for the trend, the way things
are going. By using key point men on Capitol Hill, IPS was able to
break into the very infrastructure of our legislative system and the
way it works.
To give only a single concrete example of what I am talking about:
in 1975, an IPS point man persuaded representative John Conyers
(D-Michigan) and forty-seven members of the House to request IPS to
prepare a budget study that would oppose the budget being prepared
by President Gerald Ford. Although not adopted, the request was
reinstated in 1976, 1977, and 1978 gathering sponsors as it went.
Then in 1978, fifty-six Congressmen signed their names to sponsor an
IPS budget study. This was prepared by Marcus Raskin. Raskins
budget called for a fifty percent cut in the Defense Budget, a
socialist housing program that would compete with and steadily
replace private housing and mortgage markets, a national health
service, radical changes in the educational system that would
disrupt capitalist control over the distribution of knowledge, and
several other radical ideas.
The influence of IPS on Arms Control negotiations was a
major factor in getting Nixon to sign the treasonous ABM Treaty in
1972, which left the United States virtually defenseless against ICBM attack for almost 10 years. IPS became, and
remains to this day one of the most prestigious think tanks
controlling foreign policy decisions, which we, the people, foolishly believe are those of our law makers.
By sponsoring militant activism
at home and with links to revolutionaries abroad, by engineering
such victories as The Pentagon Papers, besieging the
corporate structure, bridging the credibility gap between
underground movements and acceptable
political activism, by penetrating religious organizations and using
them to sow discord in America, such as radical racial politics
under the guise of religion, using the establishment media
to spread IPS ideas, and then supporting them, IPS has lived up to
the role which it was founded to play.

STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE
Jesse Hobson, the first president of
Stanford Research
Institute,
in a 1952 speech made it clear what lines the institute was to
follow.
Stanford can be described as one of the jewels in Tavistocks Crown in its rule over the United States. Founded in
1946 immediately after the close of WW II, it was presided over
by Charles A. Anderson, with emphasis on mind control re-search
and future sciences. Included under the Stanford umbrella was
Charles F. Kettering Foundation which developed the Changing
Images of Man upon which the Aquarian Conspiracy rests.
Some of Stanfords major clients and contracts were at first
centered around the defense establishment but, as Stanford grew, so
did the diversity of its services:
-
Applications of Behavioral Sciences to Research
-
Management
-
Office of Science and Technology
-
SRI Business Intelligence Program
-
U.S. Department of Defense Directorate of Defense
-
Research and Engineering
-
U.S. Department of Defense Office of Aerospace Research
Among corporations seeking Stanfords services were
One of Stanfords more secret projects was
extensive work on chemical and bacteriological warfare (CAB)
weapons.
Stanford Research is plugged into at least 200 smaller think tanks
doing research into every facet of life in America. This is known as
ARPA networking and represents the emergence of probably the most
far-reaching effort to control the environment of every individual
in the country. At present Stanfords computers are linked with 2500
sister research consoles which include the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), Bell Telephone Laboratories, U.S.
Army Intelligence, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI),
RANI, MIT,
Harvard and UCLA. Stanford plays a key role in that it is the
library, cataloging all ARPA documentation.
Other agenciesand one can use ones imagination here, are allowed
to search through SRIs library for key words, phrases, look
through sources and update their own master files with those of
Stanford Research Center. The Pentagon, for instance, uses SRIs
master files extensively, and there is little doubt that other
U.S. Government agencies do the same. Pentagon command and control
problems are worked out by Stanford.
While ostensibly these apply only to weapons and soldiers, there is
absolutely no guarantee that the same research could not, and will
not, be turned to civilian applications. Stanford is known to be
willing to do anything for anyone, and it is my belief that if ever
SRI were to be fully exposed, the hostility which would arise from
revelations as to what it actually does would most probably force
SRI to close.

MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,
ALFRED P. SLOAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT
This major institute is not generally recognized as being a part of
Tavistock U.S.A. Most people look upon it as a purely American
institution, but that is far from being the case. MIT-Alfred Sloan
can be roughly divided into the following groups:
Forrestor and Meadows wrote
The
Club of Romes Limits of Growth zero growth study.
Some of MITs clients include the following:
-
American Management
Association
-
American Red Cross
-
Committee for Economic
Development
-
GTE
-
Institute for Defense
Analysis (IDA)
-
NASA
-
National Academy of Sciences
-
National Council of Churches
-
Sylvania
-
TRW
-
U.S. Army
-
U.S. Department of State
-
U.S. Navy
-
U.S. Treasury
-
Volkswagen Company
So vast is the reach of IDA that it would take hundreds of pages to
describe the activities in which it is engaged, and IDA is fully
described in my book on the role played by Institutions and
Foundations in committing treason against the United States of
America, which will be published early in 1992.

RAND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION
Without a doubt, RAND is THE think tank most beholden to
Tavistock
Institute and certainly the RIIAs most prestigious vehicle for
control of United States policies at every level.
Specific RAND policies that became operative include our ICBM
program, prime analyses for U.S. foreign policy making, instigator
of space programs, U.S. nuclear policies, corporate analyses,
hundreds of projects for the military, the Central intelligence
Agency (CIA) in relation to the use of mind altering drugs like
peyote, LSD (the covert
MK-Ultra operation which lasted for 20
years).
Some of RANDs clients include the following:
-
American Telephone and
Telegraph Company (AT&T)
-
Chase Manhattan Bank
-
International Business
Machines (IBM)
-
National Science Foundation
-
Republican Party
-
TRW
-
U.S. Air Force
-
U.S. Department of Energy
-
U.S. Department of Health
There are literally THOUSANDS of
highly important companies,
government institutions and organizations that make use of RANDs
services, and to list them all would be an impossible task. Among
RANDs specialities is a study group that predicts the timing and
the direction of a thermonuclear war, plus working out the many
scenarios based upon its findings.
RAND was once accused of being
commissioned by the USSR to work out terms of surrender of the
United States Government, an accusation that went all the way to the
United States Senate, where it was taken up by Senator Symington and
subsequently fell victim to articles of scorn poured out by the
establishment press. BRAIN WASHING remains the primary function of
RAND.
