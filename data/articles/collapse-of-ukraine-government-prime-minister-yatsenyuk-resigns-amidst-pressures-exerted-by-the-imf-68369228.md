Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk
announced his resignation in the Rada (Parliament)
and that
of the entire Cabinet on Thursday, July 24.
This
decision was taken following the
withdrawal of two parties from the coalition government
and the
non-adoption of two important pieces of legislation,
which
had been demanded by
the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
"I announce
my resignation after the collapse of the coalition and the blocking of
government initiatives
in connection with the breakup of the
parliamentary coalition, as well as non-adoption of a number of
important bills, I announce my resignation."
The resignation of the Prime Minister signifies
the collapse of the government and the resignation of the entire cabinet.
"But the cabinet members will continue
fulfilling their duties until a new coalition is formed in the Rada."
On July 24th,
the Rada failed to support the government's
bill pertaining to the 2014 budget sequestration, which had been demanded by
the IMF on behalf of Kiev's external creditors.
The disbursement by the IMF of the "Second
Tranche" of a 17 billion dollar policy based loan was conditional upon the
prior adoption of this legislation.
"The parliament must adopt amendments to the
state budget needed to finance our army
and also documents needed for cooperation with international financial
institutions. [e.g. IMF, World Bank, EBRD]"
said PM Yatsenyuk.
The entire country is in an impasse.
No money will be forthcoming from the IMF until
this legislation is adopted. In the meantime, Ukraine remains on the
blacklist of its external creditors. Moreover, a controversial draft law on
reforming the country's gas transportation system was rejected (Itar-Tass,
July 24, 2014). Both bills were tied into the government's negotiations with
both the EU and the IMF.
What Happens
Next?
The national economy is in crisis, the political
structures of the country are in total disarray, all of which is occurring
in the immediate wake of
the Malaysian Airlines MH17 crash in
Eastern Ukraine.
The two parties which left the coalition are The
Neo-Nazi Svoboda party and the Centre Right Ukraine Democratic
Alliance for Reform (UDAR) Party led by former champion boxer Vitali
Klitschko.
President Petro Poroshenko (above)
has intimated that the resignation of the cabinet has paved the way for a
process of meaningful political restructuring:
"Society wants a full reset of state
authorities," said Mr Poroshenko.
What is implied by Poroshenko's statement is
that the parliamentary process is slated to become defunct inasmuch as Rada
is obligated to adopt the legislation
demanded by the IMF and the European Union.
And if the Rada does not adopt the legislation,
the composition of the Parliament will be changed through a process of
outright political manipulation.
The 2014 budget project demanded by the IMF
includes massive cuts in social spending coupled with increased allocations
to the Armed Forces. Its adoption will contribute (virtually overnight) to a
further process of the impoverishment of the Ukraine population.
The speaker of the Rada, Mr. Oleksandr
Turchynov confirmed that the Ukraine Democratic Alliance for Reform
(UDAR) and Svoboda (Freedom) would be invited to propose a candidate
to occupy the post of interim Prime Minister.
So much for democracy: the leader of a Neo-Nazi
formation Oleh Tyahnybok (below) will play a key role in
the appointment of an interim Prime Minister to replace Mr. Yatsenyuk.
Parliamentary elections will only occur if the
Rada fails to forge a new coalition government within the next 30 days:
The breakup of the coalition "was probably
agreed on by political parties seeking elections and the president,"
Yuriy Yakymenko, the head of political research at Kiev's Razumkov
Center, a non-governmental policy group, said by phone.
"Withdrawals from the coalition should not
paralyze the parliament's work," Poroshenko said before Yatsenyuk
announced his resignation."

Yuriy
Yatsenyuk intimated in his resignation speech that the State was
bankrupt and that failure to abide by IMF demands would create social chaos:
"The fact is that today you failed to vote
for the laws, and I have nothing (with
which) to pay wages of policemen, doctors, teachers; nothing to buy a
rifle with, nothing to fuel an armored personnel carrier with.
Today you failed to take a decision to fill
the gas storages to allow us to live through the winter, to at last free
ourselves from dependence on Russian gas."

The IMF Program and the
Interim Government
In the days following the Ukraine coup d'Etat of
February 23, which led to the ousting of the duly elected president, Wall
Street and the IMF - in liaison with the US Treasury and the European
Commission in Brussels - had already set the stage for the imposition of the
IMF's "strong economic medicine".
Following the installation of the interim
coalition government, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk dismissed the
need to even negotiate with the IMF.
He called for an an unconditional acceptance of
IMF shock therapy:
"We
have no other choice but to accept the IMF offer".
Yatsenyuk intimated that Ukraine will,
"accept whatever offer the IMF and the EU
made".

In surrendering to the IMF at the outset of the
interim government in March 2014, Yatsenyuk was fully aware that the
proposed
IMF-World Bank macro-economic reforms would
brutally impoverish millions of people, including those who protested in
Maidan against the Yanukovitch government.
The adoption of the more ruthless components of
the IMF's economic package requiring supportive legislation had been delayed
until after the May 25 elections.
Cracking Down on the
Party of Regions and the Communist Party
Meanwhile, the government is cracking down on
the Ukraine Communist Party which is now illegal as well as on the
Party of Regions, both of which were firmly opposed to the IMF policy
reforms.
Ukraine as An Ally without NATO Status
In turn, the Ministry of Defense has raised the
issue of direct US military support in the military campaign in Eastern
Ukraine, where the Donbass militia have repealed the forces of the Kiev
regime.
"The current situation testifies to clear
Russian interference in Ukraine and its military support to terrorist
groups active in Ukraine's eastern regions
Right now, Ukraine's armed forces need
international support more than ever before", said Deputy Defense Ihor
Kabanenko to David Baldwin, commander of the California National Guard.

Post, July 24, 2014)
Commander David Baldwin was in Kiev for
high level consultations with the Ministry of Defense.
In the course of his meetings with Deputy
Defense Minister Ihor Kabanenko, Baldwin announced on behalf of the
US government that:
"The United States of America is
considering the
possibility of granting Ukraine the status of an ally without membership
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Baldwin said that the American side highly
appreciates its cooperation with the Armed Forces of Ukraine and that it
is ready to provide comprehensive support to them.
He
stressed that a draft law on prevention of Russian aggression, adoption
of which will allow Ukraine to obtain the status of an ally of the
United States without NATO membership, is
currently under consideration by the United States government.
President Petro Poroshenko has asked the
United States Congress to declare the self-proclaimed "People's Republic
of Luhansk" and "People's Republic of Donetsk" as terrorist
organizations and declare their members as terrorists.
Poroshenko believes that when sanctions are
not working, there are grounds for appeal to the United States Congress
to grant Ukraine the special status of
a major ally outside NATO (like Israel, Australia, and the Philippines)
to enable it to solve its security problems.
(Ukrainian
News, July 24, 2014)
The granting of the
"status of ally outside NATO"
would set the stage for the possible deployment of US and
NATO forces inside Ukraine in the context
of joint military operations with the Ukraine Armed Forces and National
Guard.
