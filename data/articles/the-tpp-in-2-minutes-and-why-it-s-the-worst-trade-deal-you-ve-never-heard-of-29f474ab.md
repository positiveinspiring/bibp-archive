The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) is the largest trade agreement since the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United States has been engaged in discussion with eight Pacific nations to come to an agreement on the terms of the TPP.
It is a free trade contract that would allow for a more open system of exchange between the United States and less developed nations, apparently, and it has been wrapped in secrecy since discussions began within the Bush administration in 2005. This is one of many examples of global economic/political partnerships and deals that are happening behind the back of the public eye. Below is a video of Robert Reich, an American political economist and professor who served in the administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, talking about the deal. He was also Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1997. The TPP is not really "secret," but it sure does seem that way, which is why I chose to raise awareness about it here. Why is it wrapped in secrecy? Because it's not really about 'trade.'
The agreement has 29 chapters, and only five of them have to do with trade.
The other 24 chapters either put,
restrictions on domestic governments limit food safety diminish environmental standards and personal privacy,
restrictions on domestic governments
limit food safety
diminish environmental standards and personal privacy,
...or otherwise deal with,
financial regulation energy climate policy,

climate policy,
...and more.
As illustrated in the video below, it's basically an agreement for establishing new and enhanced powers for the multinational corporations that seem to own all of the world's resources.
It will affect all the industries we choose to allow to govern our planet and the way that we live.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
is the largest - and worst - trade deal you've never heard of
and Republicans in Congress want to work
with the Obama administration
to "fast track" its passage!
