The decision of the
US Federal Reserve to raise its key interest rate was
definitely not a sign of confidence in the US economic recovery or a signal
that Fed policy is slowly returning to normal as claimed. It was rather a
signal of panic over the weakness in US Government bond markets, the heart
of the dollar financial system.
Financial markets have reacted with jubilation, by buying dollars and
selling Euros, at the decision by the Fed to raise rates for the first time
since 2006 for its so-called Discount Rate, going from 0.5% to 0.75%.
The
Discount Rate is the interest rate charged for banks to borrow from the
central bank. At the same time the Fed left its more important short-term
Fed Funds rate unchanged and historically low - between 0.0% and 0.25%. In
its official statement the Board of Governors said the rate move was
intended to push private banks back into the private inter-bank borrowing
market and away from reliance on Federal Reserve subsidized money which had
been provided since the financial crisis began in August 2007.
The decision, in plain words, was framed so as to give the impression of a
return to business as usual.
At the same time, financial players like
George Soros continue to speak openly about the fundamental weakness of the
Euro. This has the effect of taking speculative pressure away from
fundamentally worse economic and financial fundamentals within the dollar
zone at the expense of the Euro.
The reality is that the dollar world is
anything but returning to normal.
Unsustainable deficits
The conservative President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, Thomas Hoenig recently warned in a little-reported speech that if the size of the
Federal Budget deficit is not dramatically and urgently reduced, public debt
will soon look like that of Italy or Greece, exceeding 100% of GDP.
In a
recent speech Hoenig noted,
The fiscal projections for the United States
are so stunning that, one way or another, reform will occur. Fiscal policy
is on an unsustainable course. The US government must make adjustments in
its spending and tax programs. It is that simple. If pre-emptive corrective
action is not taken regarding the fiscal outlook, then the United States
risks precipitating its own next crisis...
Translated into laymens language, that means savage cuts in Government
spending at a time when real unemployment is running in the range of an
unofficial 23% of the workforce, and the states are struggling to cut their
own spending, as Federal dollars disappear.
In brief, the United States economy, though no one is willing to say so, is
caught in a Third World-style debt trap. If the Government cuts the
deficit, the economy sinks deeper into depression.
But if it continues to
print money and sell debt, buyers of US Treasury debt will at a certain
point refuse to buy, meaning US interest rates could be forced severely high
in the midst of depression conditions - equally catastrophic to the economy.
Bond boycott?
The second option, a boycott by buyers of US bonds, may have already begun.
On February 11, the US Treasury held an auction of $16 billion worth of
30-year bonds and securities to finance its exploding deficits. In a
little-reported feature of a sale which did not go well in terms of demand,
foreign central banks reduced their share of purchases from a recent average
of 43% of the total to a mere 28%.
The largest foreign central bank buyers
of US debt in recent years have been China and Japan. Secondly, it appears
that the Federal Reserve itself was forced to buy the slack demand, some 24%
of the total of bonds sold versus 5% only a month before.
The Federal deficit will reach an estimated $1.6 trillion in the current
fiscal year that ends September 2010 and will continue next year and for at
least another decade, above $1 trillion annually.
The situation will be further aggravated because the largest generation born
after the Second World War, the so-called Baby Boom generation born between
1945-1966, has just begun retiring in huge numbers.
That deprives the
Federal Government of their Social Security tax revenues, which will now go
from an asset in the Federal budget to a liability, as the Government must
pay out their monthly retirement pensions. This will hugely aggravate the
size of the deficits over the next decade and longer.
The highly-touted Clinton era Budget surplus was in reality not the result
of anything done by Clinton or his Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and
Larry Summers. Rather it was because of the deceptive practice of counting
on the Social Security tax revenues from that generation as US Government
surplus revenue during their peak earning years in the late 1990s.
That tax
inflow has now begun to turn into what will be a huge outflow over the next
decade.
A new China syndrome
However, in the face of all this the White House seems to be implementing a
series of foolish policies, with one action in direct contradiction to
another. This is the case in terms of recent Washington behavior towards
China, the largest holder of US Government bonds, at least until this past
month.
The Obama White House has recently approved
punitive import tariffs on
Chinese auto tires. Then it increased friction in relations with its largest
creditor by announcing a provocative new arms sale of billions of dollars to
Taiwan over strong Chinese protest. In addition, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton has meddled in internal Chinese Internet regulation by openly
criticizing China for alleged censorship.
Then, as if to rub salt in a wound, despite further official Chinese
protest, US President Obama officially met with the Dalai Lama in a
Washington ceremony on February 18.
Genuine concern for the well-being of
Tibetan monks was not likely the reason. It was to signal heightened US
pressure on China.
Officially, to date, Beijing has reacted calmly, if
firmly.
Its real response, however, might be coming in a financial arena,
not a political one, something that the ancient Chinese military
philosopher,
Sun Tzu, would have no doubt suggested.
It appears that the Chinese government has already begun to react to the
ill-timed US pressures on China by boycotting US Treasury debt buying. In
December the Chinese were net sellers of US Government bonds, selling more
than $ 43 billion worth of US debt.
Given its huge annual trade surplus from
its export earnings, the National Bank of China currently holds reserves of
foreign currencies and other assets, including gold, worth $ 2.4 trillion.
At least 60% of that is believed to be in US Treasury and other
Government-guaranteed debt, perhaps some $1.4 trillion. If China continues
to dump US debt onto international financial markets, the dollar will plunge
and a full panic will ensue in Wall Street and beyond.
To try to reverse this trend of boycotting US bond purchases by foreign
central banks and others was likely the real reason that the Bernanke Fed
now suddenly raised a key interest rate, despite the worsening of the
domestic economy in real terms. They seem to be engaged in a colossal market
game of bluff, trying to convince that the worst is over.
That Fed move, as well as recent hedge fund and Wall Street attacks on the
Euro in the context of the Greek events, are looking more and more like
covert economic warfare for the future survival of the US dollar as world
reserve currency.
As my latest book (forthcoming book), "Gods of Money: Wall Street and the
Death of the American Century" explains, US global power since 1945 has
depended on having the dollar as undisputed world reserve currency and the
US military as the worlds dominant power.
If the dollar falls away, the
over-extended military becomes vulnerable as well.

Writer, researcher and analyst
F. William Engdahl joins us to discuss a theory of money as an extension of
political power.
We talk about the geopolitical
ramifications of this theory and find out details about his forthcoming
book,
"The Gods of Money - Wall Street and
the Death of the American Century"

The Fed is in a desperate situation of trying to avert a full bond market
selling panic that would trigger such a financial chain reaction collapse.
This is why it raised one rate while leaving the more important Fed Funds
rate at zero. Its a desperate bluff. So far the lemmings in the financial
markets appear to have bought the trick. How long that will last is unclear.
As the Greek crisis is resolved and it becomes clear that the situation,
however difficult, in Spain and Portugal and Italy are not about default, as
their problems are no where near terminal, the prospects for the dollar and
Euro could change dramatically.
In this situation Chinas central bank holds major power to decide the
possible outcome. One possible outcome of the growing global impasse is the
prospect that the Peoples Bank of China will dramatically increase its
purchases of gold and silver reserves.
That, in turn, could serve China far
better than buying more US debt, and serve as a basis to establish a future
role of its currency in regional trade and international business
independent of the dollar or the Euro.
A golden opportunity
Chinas gold reserves until recently have been relatively low compared to
the size of its reserves.
Official Chinese central bank gold reserves were
1,054 tons as of March 2009, worth about $37 billion at today's prices. That
represents a mere 1.5% of its total reserves, and that is itself up by 76%
since 2003. On average, international central banks hold about 10% of their
reserves in gold.
The German Bundesbank holds some 3,400 tons of gold, the
second largest after the US Federal Reserve.
To even get to that 10% level,
China would have to buy more than $200 billion worth - about two years'
global mine output.
Silver is not a significant part of most countries' reserves, but China is
historically an exception, since in Imperial times before 1900 it was on a
silver standard rather a gold standard, and so retained substantial silver
reserves. One aim of the 1840s British Opium Wars against China was to
drain the Chinese state of its entire silver currency reserves to the
advantage of the British gold standard.
In 2001 and 2002 China was a major seller of silver, selling a total of 100
million ounces at its then-price of less than $5 an ounce.
Since then, it
has stopped selling silver.
Last September 2009, the Chinese government
passed a decree encouraging Chinese savers to buy silver, explaining that
buying silver was a good deal since the gold/silver price ratio at 70-to-1
was historically very high, offering them convenient small-value ingots with
which to buy it, and prohibiting the export of silver from China.
This was almost certainly a move designed to dampen stock-market speculation
and reduce money supply growth, since bank deposits converted into silver
would effectively be sterilized. What's more, if the long-awaited Chinese
banking crisis ever developed, the effect on the long-suffering Chinese
public would be mitigated if people held substantial wealth in the form of
readily negotiable silver ingots.
It's likely that China is now a very large buyer of silver, possibly even
more than gold.
Thus, a sell-off in People's Bank of China holdings of US
Treasuries could be offset by purchases of gold for its own account and of
silver to supply to the Chinese public.
