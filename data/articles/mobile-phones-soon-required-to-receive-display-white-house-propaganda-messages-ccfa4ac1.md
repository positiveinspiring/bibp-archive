If you're tired of all the half-truths, the
propaganda and the complete disinformation that has been spewing from the
White House for at least the last twelve years, you can always turn off your
television.
Switch off the radio. Or just like everybody else, stop reading
printed newspapers. But the U.S. government has decided it must reach you
with its official propaganda one way or another, so now it is mandating that
all mobile phones sold in the United States automatically receive and
display "terror messages" from the White House.
Verizon and AT&T have already signed on to the scheme, and starting in
2012,
all mobile phones will be required to have this capability. This "feature"
will continue for as long as the U.S. federal government continues to exist.
Can you imagine
what
Bush would have done with this technology?
The very idea that the White House is the best source of emergency
information is unbelievably arrogant to begin with. If anything, over the
last several presidents we've seen that the White House is probably the
worst source of information you can possibly find. It is the least likely to
dish out information based on facts because it always has a one-sided
political agenda.
To think that the White House is a credible source of
information about anything is to exist in an elaborate fairytale land where
facts don't matter at all.
Alerts are mandated
Interestingly, you can't turn off the White House alerts, meaning you'll be
forced to read whatever current disinfo is being passed off as some kind of
alert. Watch out! Bin Laden is in your refrigerator! No wait, he's stealing
your light bulbs!
Or as former president
George Bush was fond of saying,
"Today's terror color is ORANGE!"
Get ready for a barrage of utterly fabricated, socially-engineered
propaganda to be "pushed" to the population via their mobile phones.
This is
George Orwell's Ministry of Truth in full operation mode, clued right in to
people's fingertips. If you're going to control the sheeple, after all, you
have to have a way to push your disinfo into their heads, and this mobile
phone push technology is about as good as it gets.
The FCC also says the system can push Amber alerts and any other information
the government wants to put in front of your face.
So on the day
the dollar
is crashing, you'll all be sent a message,
"Everything is fine. The banks
are merely on a short holiday. Do not be concerned..."
Or I suppose the next time a nuclear power plant goes Chernobyl in the USA,
and there's radioactive fallout threatening America, the White House can
send out an alert that says,
"Do NOT prepare. There is nothing to be
concerned about. We have it all under control."
Someone needs to write a White House alert translator that takes the
official alerts and translates them into reality:
"Do not be concerned"
would translate to, "The nation is on the verge of panic," for example.
"Your money is safe" means "your money is about to disappear."
And "We have
it under control" means "it's completely out of control."
So the alert that reads,
"Do not be concerned. Your money is safe. We have
it under control," actually means your money is about to become worthless
and the nation will break down into a panic that will get completely out of
control.
What we really need is
an alternative news push
What America really needs is for mobile phones to carry an alert system from
the alternative media.
We'd push messages like, "Did you know mammograms
cause breast cancer?" Or, "There is cancer-causing poison in hot dogs and
bacon."
One tip each day, you see, based on solid facts that people really
need to know.
"Have you read the warning label on that vaccine?"
But of course the FCC would never allow truthful messages to be broadcast
through this alert system. It only exists for propaganda, not factual
information that might be useful to people.
Speaking of pushing information, NaturalNews is working on an iPhone app
that will push alerts to users, but of course you have to want the alerts
(and install the app) in order to receive them.
The White House, on the
other hand, will be pushing alerts to everyone, even if they never signed up
for them. And you can't turn them off, either.
It's a forced system in the
same way that the federal government uses force for everything else:
-
FDA
raids on vitamin companies
-
DEA arrests of licensed medical marijuana
growers
-
FTC threats on herbal product companies,
...and so on.
They'd better make sure to get their timing right on these alerts. If they
send out an alert that says,
"There has been a dirty bomb terrorist attack
in New York" but they accidentally send it before the attack happens, some
people will do the math and figure out what's up.
You can bet the White House won't send any alerts that you really need to
know.
"The U.S. national debt has hit $16 trillion and your economic future
is now in doubt."
Don't hold your breath waiting for that alert to appear on
your mobile phone anytime soon.
"The U.S. dollar has been devalued yet again today by the quantitative
easing of the Federal Reserve, which keeps printing trillions of dollars in
new currency that dilute the value of YOUR currency."
Again, don't sit
around waiting for that message to show up, either.
"The
chemical and pharmaceutical companies have polluted our farms, streams,
rivers and oceans, rendering the future of life in North America
questionable."
Hmmm... probably not going to see that message, either.
What
you're likely to get instead is a steady drone of "sheeple alerts" that keep
people living in fear and not knowing what to do:
Red alert! Terrorists are now saying they will attack TRAINS and STADIUMS
using BUTT CRACK BOMBS. So to protect you, we will install TSA checkpoints
at all the train stations and sports stadiums.
Please open your butt crack
for inspection.
Thank you for your cooperation.
What's coming next
White House takes over
internet DNS to force people to view messages online
To take this one step further, the White House could force ISPs to remap DNS
requests so that all web browsers automatically point to the White House
website, no matter what web address you type in.
-
Searching for sports scores? You'll be rerouted to the White House alert
page.
-
Checking your sinking stock portfolio online? You'll get the White
House page.
-
Researching how to grow your own medical marijuana using
hydroponics? You'll get the White House page yet again.
This type of technology can be implemented right now, by the way.
It's more
than an internet "kill switch," it's an internet "reroute switch." And it
may already be in place without us even knowing about it.
The only way to circumvent this tactic and get directly to the web server
you want is to know the IP address of the server.
For example, NaturalNews.com can be reached at:
http://174.132.185.226
If you keep this address handy (bookmark it or whatever), then the White
House cannot reroute your website requests via DNS. This is why it's a good
idea to know the IP addresses of all the key websites you'll need to access
to get good information during a "total information blackout" attempt by the
U.S. government.
Remember:
The Internet is the last place on Earth where you
can get truthful information about what's really happening. That is exactly
why it will be targeted for a shutdown during the next big crisis to strike
America.
Because the very last thing any government wants its people to have is
access to truthful information. Hence the
assaults on Wikileaks and
anyone
who dares to question the status quo.
