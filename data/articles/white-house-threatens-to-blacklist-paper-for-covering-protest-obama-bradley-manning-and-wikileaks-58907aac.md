The
San Francisco Chronicle is apparently in
trouble with the White House for posting video of a protest against the
White House's treatment of suspected
WikiLeaks source
Bradley Manning.
The Chronicle's Carolyn Lochhead reports:
The White House threatened Thursday to
exclude the San Francisco Chronicle from pooled coverage of its events
in the Bay Area after the paper
posted a video of a protest (below
video) at a San Francisco fundraiser for President Obama last
week, Chronicle editor Ward Bushee said.
White House guidelines governing press
coverage of such events are too restrictive, Bushee said, and the
newspaper was within its rights to film the protest and post the video.
Chronicle reporter Carla Marinucci was
the designated "pool" reporter at an Obama fundraiser - meaning that her
write-up would be shared with other reporters who were not allowed into the
event.
But something truly newsworthy happened - and she reported it:
At the St. Regis event, a group of
protesters who paid collectively $76,000 to attend the fundraiser
interrupted Obama with a song complaining about the administration's
treatment of PFC Bradley Manning, the soldier who allegedly leaked U.S.
classified documents to the WikiLeaks website (video above.)
As part of a "print-only pool," Marinucci was limited by White House
guidelines to provide a print-only report, but Marinucci also took a
video of the protest, which she posted in her written story on the
online edition of the Chronicle at SFGate.com and on its politics blog
after she sent her written pool report.
The Chronicle's story closes with this ironic
point about the White House's view of technology and information-sharing:
At Facebook the day before the San Francisco
fundraiser, Obama said,
"The main reason we wanted to do this
is, first of all, because more and more people, especially young
people, are getting their information through different media. And
obviously, what all of you have built together is helping to
revolutionize how people get information, how they process
information, how they're connecting with each other."
Apparently Marinucci posting a video was a
little too much revolutionizing.
