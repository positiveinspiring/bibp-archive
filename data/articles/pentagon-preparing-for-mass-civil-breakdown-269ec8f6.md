A US Department of Defense (DoD)
research program is funding universities to model the dynamics,
risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world,
under the supervision of various
US military agencies.
The multi-million dollar
program is designed to
develop immediate and long-term "warfighter-relevant insights" for
senior officials and decision makers in "the defense policy community,"
and to inform policy implemented by "combatant commands."
Launched
in 2008 - the
year of the global banking crisis - the
DoD 'Minerva Research
Initiative' partners with universities,
"to improve DoD's basic understanding of
the social, cultural, behavioral, and political forces that shape
regions of the world of strategic importance to the US."
Among the projects awarded for the period
2014-2017 is a Cornell University-led study managed by the US Air Force
Office of Scientific Research which aims to develop an empirical model
"of the dynamics of social movement mobilization and contagions."
The project will determine,
"the critical
mass (tipping point)" of social contagions by studying their "digital traces" in the cases of "the
2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012
Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in
Turkey."
Twitter posts and conversations will be
examined,
"to identify individuals mobilized in a
social contagion and when they become mobilized."
Another project awarded this year to the
University of Washington,
"seeks to uncover the conditions under
which political movements aimed at large-scale political and
economic change originate," along with their "characteristics and
consequences."
The project, managed by the US Army Research
Office, focuses on,
"large-scale movements involving more
than 1,000 participants in enduring activity," and will cover 58
countries in total.
Last year, the DoD's Minerva Initiative
funded a project to determine 'Who
Does Not Become a Terrorist, and Why?' which, however, conflates
peaceful activists with "supporters of political violence" who are
different from terrorists only in that they do not embark on "armed
militancy" themselves.
The project explicitly sets out to study
non-violent activists:
"In every context we find many
individuals who share the demographic, family, cultural, and/or
socioeconomic background of those who decided to engage in
terrorism, and yet refrained themselves from taking up armed
militancy, even though they were sympathetic to the end goals of
armed groups.
The field of terrorism studies has not,
until recently, attempted to look at this control group. This
project is not about terrorists, but about supporters of
political violence."
The project's 14 case studies each,
"involve extensive interviews with ten
or more activists and militants in parties and NGOs who, though
sympathetic to radical causes, have chosen a path of non-violence."
I contacted the project's principal
investigator, Prof. Maria Rasmussen of the US Naval Postgraduate
School, asking why non-violent activists working for NGOs should be
equated to supporters of political violence - and which "parties and
NGOs" were being investigated - but received no response.
Similarly, Minerva program staff refused to
answer a series of similar questions I put to them, including asking how
"radical causes" promoted by peaceful NGOs constituted a potential
national security threat of interest to the DoD.
Among my questions, I asked:
"Does the US Department of Defense see
protest movements and social
activism in different parts of the world as a threat to US
national security?
If so, why? Does the US Department of
Defense consider political movements aiming for large scale
political and economic change as a national security matter? If so,
why?
Activism, protest, 'political movements'
and of course NGOs are a vital element of a healthy civil society
and democracy - why is it that the DoD is funding research to
investigate such issues?"
Minerva's program director Dr. Erin
Fitzgerald said,
"I appreciate your concerns and am glad
that you reached out to give us the opportunity to clarify" before
promising a more detailed response.
Instead, I received the following bland
statement from the DoD's press office:
"The Department of Defense takes
seriously its role in the security of the
United States, its citizens, and US allies and partners.
While every security challenge does not
cause conflict, and every conflict does not involve the US military,
Minerva helps fund basic social science research that helps increase
the Department of Defense's understanding of what causes instability
and insecurity around the world.
By better understanding these conflicts
and their causes beforehand, the Department of Defense can better
prepare for the dynamic future security environment."
In 2013, Minerva funded a University of
Maryland project in collaboration with the US Department of Energy's
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to gauge the risk of civil unrest
due to
climate change.
The
three-year $1.9 million project is developing models to anticipate
what could happen to societies under a range of potential climate change
scenarios.
From the outset, the Minerva program was
slated to provide over $75 million over five years for social and
behavioral science research. This year alone it has been allocated a
total budget of $17.8 million by US Congress.
An internal Minerva staff email
communication referenced in
a 2012 Masters dissertation reveals that the program is geared
toward producing quick results that are directly applicable to field
operations.
The dissertation was part of a
Minerva-funded project on "counter-radical Muslim discourse" at
Arizona State University.
The internal email from Prof. Steve Corman,
a principal investigator for the project, describes a meeting hosted by
the DoD's Human Social Cultural and Behavioral Modeling (HSCB) program
in which senior Pentagon officials said their priority was,
"to develop capabilities that are
deliverable quickly" in the form of "models and tools that can be
integrated with operations."
Although Office of Naval Research supervisor
Dr. Harold Hawkins had assured the university researchers at the
outset that the project was merely,
"a basic research effort, so we
shouldn't be concerned about doing applied stuff", the meeting in
fact showed that DoD is looking to "feed results" into
"applications," Corman said in the email.
He advised his researchers to,
"think about shaping results, reports,
etc., so they [DoD] can clearly see their application for tools that
can be taken to the field."
Many independent scholars are critical of
what they see as the US government's efforts to militarize social
science in the service of war.
In May 2008, the American Anthropological
Association (AAA)
wrote to the US government noting that the Pentagon lacks,
"the kind of infrastructure for
evaluating anthropological [and other social science] research" in a
way that involves "rigorous, balanced and objective peer review",
calling for such research to be managed instead by civilian agencies
like the National Science Foundation (NSF).
The following month, the DoD signed a
memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the NSF to cooperate on the
management of Minerva.
In response, the AAA
cautioned that although research proposals would now be evaluated by
NSF's merit-review panels.
"Pentagon officials will have
decision-making power in deciding who sits on the panels":
"
there remain concerns within the
discipline that research will only be funded when it supports
the Pentagon's agenda.
Other critics of the program, including
the Network of Concerned Anthropologists, have raised concerns
that the program would discourage research in other important
areas and undermine the role of the university as a place for
independent discussion and critique of the military."
According to Prof. David Price, a
cultural anthropologist at St Martin's University in Washington DC and
author of Weaponizing
Anthropology: Social Science in Service of the Militarized State,
"when you looked at the individual bits
of many of these projects they sort of looked like normal social
science, textual analysis, historical research, and so on, but when
you added these bits up they all shared themes of legibility with
all the distortions of over-simplification.
Minerva is farming out
the piece-work of empire in ways that can allow individuals to
disassociate their individual contributions from the larger
project."
Prof. Price has
previously exposed how the Pentagon's Human Terrain Systems (HTS)
program - designed to embed social scientists in military field
operations - routinely conducted training scenarios set in regions
"within the United States."
Citing a summary critique of the program
sent to HTS directors by a former employee, Price reported that the HTS
training scenarios,
"adapted COIN [counterinsurgency] for
Afghanistan/Iraq" to domestic situations "in the USA where the local
population was seen from the military perspective as threatening the
established balance of power and influence, and challenging law and
order."
One war-game, said Price, involved
environmental activists protesting pollution from a coal-fired plant
near Missouri, some of whom were members of the well-known environmental
NGO Sierra Club.
Participants were tasked to,
"identify those who were
'problem-solvers' and those who were 'problem-causers,' and the rest
of the population whom would be the target of the information
operations to move their Center of Gravity toward that set of
viewpoints and values which was the 'desired end-state' of the
military's strategy."
Such war-games are consistent with a raft of
Pentagon planning documents which suggest that National Security Agency
(NSA)
mass
surveillance is partially motivated to
prepare for the destabilizing impact of coming environmental, energy and
economic shocks.
James Petras, Bartle Professor of
Sociology at Binghamton University in New York, concurs with Price's
concerns.
Minerva-funded social scientists tied to
Pentagon counterinsurgency operations are involved in the,
"study of emotions in stoking or
quelling ideologically driven movements," he said, including how "to
counteract grassroots movements."
Minerva is a prime example of the deeply
narrow-minded and self-defeating nature of military ideology.
Worse still, the unwillingness of DoD
officials to answer the most basic questions is symptomatic of a simple
fact - in their unswerving mission to defend an increasingly unpopular
global system
serving the interests of a tiny
minority, security agencies have no qualms about painting the rest
of us as potential terrorists.
