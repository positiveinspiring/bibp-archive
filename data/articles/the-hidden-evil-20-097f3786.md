# The Hidden Evil - 20

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/hiddenevil/hiddenevil20.htm

Structure
Reportedly, the ground crews that participate in patrols (Gang Stalking) are
connected to academic institutions, the Department of Energy (DOE), the
Department of Justice (DOJ), and other federal or state agencies. If this is
the case, then this program is similar to the harassment campaigns in
Germany which were run by the Stasi.
They operated a vast network of citizen
informants. Some of these informants were directed by the Stasi to conduct
patrols, where they would systematically Gang Stalk enemies of the state.
Anna Funder described the Stasi as,
"the internal army by which the government
kept control."
John O. Koehler, who served as a correspondent
for the Associated Press for 28 years, says they were,
"a criminal organization founded and
operated by a monopolistic party... that trampled on basic human rights
and on the dignity of the individual."
The Stasi existed to protect the state from the
people. More specifically, it existed to keep those in charge of the
dictatorship in control.
Fulbrook wrote, "a key task of the Stasi was to ensure that the potential
bases for collective action in opposition to... the state... did not
develop," and that, "individual 'trouble-makers' or 'ringleaders' [were]
rapidly isolated and disciplined." To accomplish this, they used their own
version of Cointelpro (Zersetzung), which had the full support of all major
components of the state, including a network of citizens which would stalk
and harass people. The Stasi and the IMs were essentially the private armies
of the individuals who controlled the country.
Apparently these harassment campaigns can legally be done. Attorney Brian
Glick wrote, "Much of what was done outside the law under Cointelpro has
since been legalized by Executive Order NO. 12333," which allows
"counterintelligence activities" by the FBI, CIA, the military, or anyone
acting on their behalf. "Specialized equipment," and expert technical
assistance may be used "to support local law enforcement." All are free to
mount electronic "surveillance" and conduct "break-ins" without a warrant.
This means that any federal or local law enforcement agency or government
contractor can conduct these "investigations." These legal "break-ins"
account for the Gaslighting tactics that targets experience.
It would be necessary for "the FCC as a minimum and the Department of Energy
as a minimum to have some oversight and control over what is going on,"
stated McKinney. "[Each] government obviously is complicit," she declared,
"because otherwise these... operations would not be allowed to exist."
McKinney's findings suggest that the FBI, CIA, and DOE are probably involved
in these harassment campaigns.
Moret added, "the military is... very directly and heavily involved in it.
But it's not just the military," she says, "it's the CIA, FBI" and other
"law enforcement" agencies. "This globally infiltrated organization,"
declared Dr. Kilde, "has "octopus type" activities in all major intelligence
services in the world," and has "recruited people from all important
government institutions, state and local administrations."
The April/May 1996 issue of Nexus Magazine provided us with another clue
with the publication of an article entitled, How the NSA Harasses Thousands
of Law Abiding Americans Daily by the Usage Of Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM).
The article stated, "The NSA gathers information on U.S. citizens who might
be of interest to any of the over 50,000 NSA agents (HUMINT). These agents
are authorized by executive order to spy on anyone. The NSA has a permanent
National Security Anti-Terrorist surveillance network in place."
The Big Lie
The elite have a tendency to fragment organizations within their hierarchy
in order to keep people ignorant as to how their organization is a small
component within a larger operation. This is how an organization with
seemingly positive objectives can be used for destructive means. Therefore,
the Hidden Evil is probably highly compartmentalized and the various
factions within it are almost certainly unaware of the existence of one and
other. For instance, the citizens who operate within the public front are
probably not aware of the use of Directed Energy Weapons, murders, or
framings. Neither are they likely to be aware of the real agenda.
An analysis of the tactics and strategies used indicates that there must be
at least several factions to this highly organized program. There is a
recruitment and training unit, which provides training to individuals,
businesses, and groups within communities. This faction more than likely
appears professional and is equipped with supporting propaganda delivered by
trusted authority figures, who claim that the program is a matter of
"national security." The individuals in this unit are probably operating on
lies themselves, because in order to sell such a program, you first need to
convince the sellers.
There is a logistics faction which coordinates public harassment such as the
arrangement of people, and vehicles, as well as informing federal, state and
local entities of a targeted person's pending arrival at their enterprise.
There is an intelligence faction, which puts people under surveillance. The
surveillance is apparently justified by a bogus investigation. Some of these
factions may be merged into a single team. For instance, the logistics
faction is obviously in direct contact with the surveillance faction, and
they may even be the same team. I refer to the combination of these factions
as, the public front, because in all likelihood, it appears beneficial and
innocent. The Citizen Corps National Neighborhood Watch program, figures
prominently.
According to the Citizen Corps' Guide for Local Officials, each community
has a Citizen Corps Council composed of representatives from law
enforcement, fire and EMT services, faith-based groups, community-based
groups, elderly and minority populations, transportation systems, utility
companies, businesses, educational institutions, environmental groups, the
media, and "[any] groups that represent a large cross-section of the
community." Basically they recruit people from all of these major groups
within the community.
The guide explains, "At the state level, all Governors have appointed a
state coordinator for Citizen Corps to facilitate this locally driven
initiative." Notice the operative word, "all." Elected officials such as
mayors and council members are also cooperating. "The state coordinator," it
continues, "will work closely with the local governments, other state
organizations, the Department of Homeland Security, (DHS), the Department of
Justice (DOJ), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other
federal agencies to implement a successful Citizen Corps program for the
state."
This means that your high ranking elected officials, as well as federal and
local law enforcement are fully aware of this program, and are donating
significant resources to it. The Citizen Corps' Neighborhood Watch program
is essentially, according to the NSA, the front line for homeland security.
So, if this program is in fact the public front that is used for mass
recruitment, then it would explain many things, such as:
-
The colossal network of volunteers
(informants) conducing citizen patrols (Gang Stalking), which is
directed by FEMA and the DHS, working with local police.
-
The near-perfect coordination of
non-stop harassment, which unfolds as targets travel around town,
including any public place, store, or restaurant.
-
The tremendous state resources that are
used which obviously require much time, effort, and financial
backing.
-
The stalking of people by vehicles
representing entities such as, the U.S. postal service, UPS and
FedEx, police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, local business, utility
companies, city vehicles, taxis, and public transportation vehicles.
And in some cases, aircraft such as small propeller planes and
helicopters.
-
The persecution of targeted people
inside essentially any local, state, or federal establishment, by
employees who work with citizens on patrol to harass them.
-
The "all hands on deck" philosophy of
the entire state engaging in well-orchestrated harassment.
-
The participation of a wide-range of
citizens, such as seniors groups, school children, religious and
ethnic organizations, etc., which are presumably drawn from various
groups within the community.
-
Because training originates from the
same source, it would explain the identical tactics used nationally
- even globally.
-
The cover-up by local and federal law
enforcement, as well as agencies which exist to help people being
tortured or persecuted.
-
Because it is a DHS initiative, it would
explain why no organization has stopped it.
What the Public Doesn't See
Citizen Corps seems to fit the
observable operational blueprint previously noted. It appears to be a likely
candidate for the public front. But there are definitely other factions,
which are probably unknown to the majority of the participating public.
Similar to the public front, some of these factions may be combined into a
single unit. These factions are also obviously directed by federal and local
law enforcement.
They include, a faction for co-opting specific individuals in a targeted
person's life (friends and family), which appears to involve lies and
intimidation. There is a faction which attacks people with Directed Energy
Weapons. There is a faction that conducts break-ins, vicious rumor
campaigns, staged accidents, framings, and blacklisting.
The program is "very hierarchical" Moret describes. She says there is a
lower faction consisting of criminals who are "already compromised" due to
their participation in illegal activities. These criminals participate in
order to gain recognition with local officials and other figureheads.
According to Dr. Kilde, this recruitment also includes the use of the mafia
and terrorists when necessary. Interestingly enough, it's a matter of public
record that the FBI works with known criminals, including those in the mafia
who are confirmed murderers, to assist with framing innocent people for
crimes. Apparently this is done for reasons of "national security." It's
also a matter of public record that the U.S. Government has funded, trained,
and even protected terrorist networks such as Al-Qaeda.
Secret Police
"Secret police (sometimes political police) are
a police organization which operates in secrecy for the purpose of
maintaining national security against internal threats to the state. Secret
police forces are typically associated with totalitarian regimes. As their
activities are not transparent to the public, their primary purpose is to
maintain the political power of the state... A state with a significant
level of secret police activity is sometimes known as a police state."
-Wikipedia Encyclopedia
To recruit regular citizens to perform nefarious acts such staged accidents
and framings, these officers can scan for certain qualities in an informant
database consisting of literally millions of people, in order to select the
mentally ill, criminals, or those who can be blackmailed. Then, these
informants, who have no official ties to the government, can be co-opted
into a staged event for reasons of national security.
In this manner, these factions may feed a steady supply of innocent people
to the public front, in order to promote group cohesiveness - thus ensuring
the survival of the program. These factions represent the true underlying
psychopathic nature of the program. Based on my research, the public front
is simply a mask used to recruit the public into a very cleverly disguised
program of torture and murder - The Hidden Evil.
Ted L. Gunderson, a retired FBI Senior Special Agent insists there are two
types of investigative operations in the U.S. intelligence agencies, overt
and covert. He says, "The overt operations involve investigators who respond
to various federal violations of the law such as bank robbery, kidnapping,
extortion, etc..." But the "covert operation" says Gunderson "involves those
who never identify themselves and are involved in harassing and targeting
citizens..."
So, if Citizen Corps is the current major operational vehicle for this
program, then FEMA, federal and local law enforcement (with full support of
the entire community), are directing these persecution campaigns on the
local level. And this unseen unit, which operates beyond the public front,
is responsible for conducting, framings, murders, staged accidents,
torturing people with Directed Energy Weapons, blacklisting, and mocking
people with V2K - all done under the banner of national security.
Who created the Hidden Evil? The creators of this program have enough global
influence to initiate policy in all NATO nations. They also have the
authority to issue worldwide stand-down orders on organizations like the Red
Cross, ACLU, Amnesty International, etc. And they have the money to finance
it.
Who benefits from this program? When investigating a matter, if the evidence
you've been able to gather indicates a specific pattern which is not easily
produced, then it is reasonable to conclude that any entity which can
produce the pattern, and has done so in the past, is suspect. Furthermore,
it is also reasonable to conclude that if the same entity has the motive,
the means, and the opportunity, then it is suspect.
Hypothesis A
In his book America's Secret
Establishment, Professor Antony C. Sutton describes a hypothesis as "a
theory... which has to be supported by evidence." He continues, "Now in
scientific methodology a hypothesis can be proven. It cannot be disproven
(sic). It is up to the reader to decide whether the evidence presented later
supports... the hypothesis." Sutton states that no reader can decide until
they've absorbed all of the evidence presented.
Think Tanks created the Hidden Evil. This includes, but is not limited to,
The Bilderbergers, The Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign
Relations, and their interlocks, funded by the Tax-exempt Complex.(*) These
organizations are heavily interlocked with Wall Street and the Federal
Reserve. Policy set by these unelected rulers becomes law with regularity.
The Hidden Evil was not a willful creation of the public that voted it into
existence, it was done by secrecy. Essentially, it is the creation of what
congress, federal law enforcement, and researchers have called, the
Invisible Government, or the Shadow Government.
The following three individuals have worked with government Think Tanks, and
have evidently contributed to the fine-tuning of this program. They include
Dr. John Alexander, Janet Morris and Chris Morris.(**) The Morris' and Dr.
Alexander have worked with Think Tanks such as the Council on Foreign
Relations, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and
the U.S. Global Strategy Council (USGSC) researching Non-lethal Weapons
technologies. They have also instructed government officials on the use of
Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). Here is a brief biography of each, which
was taken from their websites.
Mr. Chris Morris
Mr. Morris has worked with organizations such as Raytheon, Alliant
Techsystems, Olin Ordnance, Primex, ARDEC, Delfin Systems, the Millburn
Corporation, the Human Potential Foundation, Lawrence Livermore National
Lab, Argonne National Lab, Penn State Advanced Research Lab, Westinghouse
Electronic Systems, BDM International, the United Kingdom Ministry of
Defense, USGSC, CSIS and others.
Prior to forming M2 Technologies with his wife Janet, Mr. Morris was
"Research Director at the U.S. Global Strategy Council [USGSC]," which he
describes as a "Washington-based think tank" founded by Ray S. Cline, the
former Deputy Director of the CIA. According to Mr. Morris, this Think Tank
was composed of "a select panel of senior government and industry experts
who met regularly to formulate and guide the Council's non-lethality
agenda." He briefed "executive branch, DoD, and Congressional officials on
non-lethal concepts, technologies and strategy."
Mr. Morris states that he has received "multiple grants to study non-lethal
technology issues for the MHW Foundation and the Winston Foundation." He
adds that he has "participated in defense technology roundtables of the
Heritage Foundation."
Ms. Janet Morris
Ms. Morris is President and CEO of M2 Technologies, Inc. (M2), which
specializes in "non-lethal weapons (NLW), novel technology applications,
tactics and technology." She has taught or provided course material to the
U.S. Air Force's Air Command and Staff College, National Defense
University's (IRMC) School of Information Warfare and Strategy, and Penn
State University Applied Research Laboratory's Non-Lethal Institute.
She has provided and presented seminars and briefings to the Defense Science
Board, the Congressional Research Service, Senate Armed Services Committee
Staff, and the Center for Naval Analysis. Like her husband, Ms. Morris
worked at the USGSC as Research Director of Non-lethals, where she provided
"strategic planning support to U.S. Government agencies, departments, and
Congressional offices."
According to McKinney, in their publication entitled, Nonlethality:
Development of a National Policy and Employing Nonlethal Means in a New
Strategic Era, the USGSC outlined the foreign and domestic use of Non-lethals,
and made numerous references to the domestic use of this technology against
elusive "enemies" of the U.S. Government.
"The term, 'non-lethal,' used to describe this technology is misleading,"
says McKinney. "The energy emitted from all of these [Microwave] weapons can
kill when appropriately amplified. At lower levels of amplification, they
can cause extreme forms of physical discomfort and debilitation."
The Morris' have provided interviews and opinion pieces for The Smithsonian,
Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, BBC, ABC, Discovery Channel, The Learning
Channel, and other media. According to the New York Times Magazine, both
have worked on a task force for the Council on Foreign Relations.
Col. John B. Alexander, PhD
His biography reads: "Dr. John
Alexander has been a leading advocate for the development of non-lethal
weapons..." He "organized and chaired the first five major conferences on
non-lethal warfare, and served as a US delegate to four NATO studies on the
topic." Dr. Alexander has worked with the "highest levels of government,"
including the White House, NSC, CIA, and other senior defense officials.
He has written articles for Harvard International Review, The Boston Globe,
The Futurist, The Washington Post, and other media. He has appeared on Fox
News, Larry King, CNN, Dateline and international television. Currently he
works as president of LEADS, Inc., and serves as an adviser to the Commander
of U.S. Special Operations Command.
He was "instrumental in influencing the report that is credited with causing
the Department of Defense to create a formal Non-Lethal Weapons Policy."
According to Dr. Alexander, the creation of this policy resulted from his
non-lethals study for the Council on Foreign Relations.
An article entitled, The Quest for the Nonkiller App, which appeared in the
July 25 issue of The New York Times Magazine, stated that Raytheon had
developed the Active Denial System (ADS) which causes "palpable pain" and
"can operate beyond small-arms range, enabling an operator to deter a foe
long before a potentially fatal clash occurs." According to the article,
Stephen Goose, Director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch, "paints
an Orwellian picture in which repressive regimes obtain nonlethal weapons to
keep restive populations in check without resorting to the sort of bloodshed
that can earn a country unwanted attention." That is exactly what is
happening now.
The article continued, "Janet Morris of M2 Technologies would like to see,
'calmative agents' - weaponized versions of Valium and other drugs -
deployed in battle." The Council on Foreign Relations has issued reports and
recommended an increase in research finances, it said, and added, both
"[Janet and Chris Morris] have worked as members of the Council on Foreign
Relations' task force."
Summary
Experts in Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP), and Non-lethals have worked
with elite Think Tanks that have been known to control most governments.
These Think Tanks are advocating the creation of a single world government
with them in complete control.
The Non-lethals which they have sponsored are
reportedly used on people worldwide. NLP is allegedly used as a weapon
during citizens' watch patrols (Gang Stalking).
Footnotes
* Although there are probably entities
coordinating these Think Tanks, they exist at the upper echelon of this
control structure and are a recognizable element of it.
** These are not the only individuals who helped create this. But they
are an identifiable link between the government Think Tanks, the
non-lethal technology, and NLP, which are used in this program.
