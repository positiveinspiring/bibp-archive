When The NSA Can't Break into Your
Computer,
these Guys Break into Your House
During a coffee break at an intelligence
conference held in The Netherlands a few years back, a senior Scandinavian
counterterrorism official regaled me with a story.
One of his service's surveillance teams was
conducting routine monitoring of a senior militant leader when they suddenly
noticed through their high-powered surveillance cameras two men breaking
into the militant's apartment. The target was at Friday evening prayers at
the local mosque.
But rather than ransack the apartment and steal
the computer equipment and other valuables while he was away - as any
right-minded burglar would normally have done - one of the men pulled out a
disk and loaded some programs onto the resident's laptop computer while the
other man kept watch at the window.
The whole operation took less than two minutes,
then the two trespassers fled the way they came, leaving no trace that they
had ever been there.
It did not take long for the official to
determine that the two men were, in fact,
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
operatives conducting what is known in the U.S. intelligence community as
either a "black bag job" or a "surreptitious entry" operation.
Back
in the Cold War, such a mission might have involved cracking safes, stealing
code books, or photographing the settings on cipher machines.
Today, this kind of break-in is known inside the
CIA and National Security Agency as an "off-net operation," a clandestine
human intelligence mission whose specific purpose is to surreptitiously gain
access to the computer systems and email accounts of targets of high
interest to America's spies.
As we've learned in recent weeks, the National
Security Agency's ability to electronically eavesdrop from afar
is massive. But it is not infinite. There are times when the agency
cannot gain access to the computers or gadgets they'd like to listen in on.
And so they call in the CIA's black bag crew for help.
The CIA's clandestine service is now conducting
these sorts of black bag operations on behalf of the NSA, but at a tempo not
seen since the height of the Cold War.
Moreover, these missions, as well as
a series of parallel
signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection operations conducted by the
CIA's Office of Technical Collection, have proven to be instrumental in
facilitating and improving the NSA's SIGINT collection efforts in the years
since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Over the past decade specially-trained CIA
clandestine operators have mounted over one hundred extremely sensitive
black bag jobs designed to penetrate foreign government and military
communications and computer systems, as well as the computer systems of some
of the world's largest foreign multinational corporations.
Spyware software
has been secretly planted in computer servers; secure telephone lines have
been bugged; fiber optic cables, data switching centers and telephone
exchanges have been tapped; and computer backup tapes and disks have been
stolen or surreptitiously copied in these operations.
In other words, the CIA has become instrumental
in setting up the shadowy surveillance dragnet that has now been thrown into
public view.
Sources within the U.S. intelligence community confirm that
since 9/11, CIA clandestine operations have given the NSA access to a number
of new and critically important targets around the world, especially in
China and elsewhere in East Asia, as well as the Middle East, the Near East,
and South Asia. (I'm not aware of any such operations here on U.S. soil.)
In
one particularly significant operation conducted a few years back in a
strife-ridden South Asian nation, a team of CIA technical operations
officers installed a sophisticated tap on a switching center servicing
several fiber-optic cable trunk lines, which has allowed NSA to intercept in
real time some of the most sensitive internal communications traffic by that
country's general staff and top military commanders for the past several
years.
In another more recent case, CIA case officers broke into a home in
Western Europe and surreptitiously loaded Agency-developed spyware into the
personal computer of a man suspected of being a major recruiter for
individuals wishing to fight with the militant group al-Nusra Front in
Syria, allowing CIA operatives to read all of his email traffic and monitor
his Skype calls on his computer.
The fact that the NSA and CIA now work so
closely together is fascinating on a number of levels. But it's particularly
remarkable accomplishment, given the fact that the two agencies until fairly
recently hated each others' guts.
Ingenues and TBARs
As detailed in my history of the NSA,
The Secret Sentry, the CIA and NSA had what could best be
described as a contentious relationship during the Cold War era.
Some NSA
veterans still refer to their colleagues at the CIA as 'TBARs,' which stands
for 'Those Bastards Across the River,' with the river in question being the
Potomac.
Perhaps reflecting their higher level of educational
accomplishment, CIA officers have an even more lurid series of monikers for
their NSA colleagues at Fort Meade, most of which cannot be repeated in
polite company because of recurring references to fecal matter.
One retired
CIA official described his NSA counterparts as "a bunch of damn
ing√©nues."
Another CIA veteran perhaps put it best when he described the Cold War
relationship amongst and between his agency and the NSA as "the best of
enemies."
The historical antagonism between the two
agencies started at the top.
Allen W. Dulles, who was the director of the
CIA from 1953 to 1961, disliked NSA director General Ralph Canine so
intensely that he deliberately kept the NSA in the dark about a number of
the agency's high-profile SIGINT projects, like the celebrated
Berlin Tunnel cable tapping operation in the mid-1950s.
The late Richard
M. Helms, who was director of the CIA from 1966 to 1973, told me over drinks
at the Army-Navy Club in downtown Washington, D.C. only half jokingly that
during his thirty-plus years in the U.S. intelligence community, his
relations with the KGB were, in his words,
"warmer and more collegial" than
with the NSA.
William E. Colby, who served as Director of Central
Intelligence from 1973-1976, had the same problem.
Colby was so frustrated
by his inability to assert any degree of control over the NSA that he told a
congressional committee that,
"I think it is clear I do not have command
authority over the [NSA]."
And the animus between CIA director Admiral Stansfield Turner (CIA director from 1977-1981) and his counterpart at the NSA, Admiral
Bobby Ray Inman, was so intense that they could only
communicate through intermediaries.
But
the 9/11 terrorist attacks changed the
operational dynamic between these two agencies, perhaps forever. In the
thirteen years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the NSA and CIA have
largely, but not completely, moved past the Cold War animus.
In addition,
both agencies have become increasingly dependent on one another for the
success of their respective intelligence operations, leading to what can
best be described as an increasingly close symbiotic relationship between
these two titans of the U.S. intelligence community.
While the increasingly intimate relationship
between the NSA and CIA is not a secret, the specific nature and extent of
the work that each agency does for the other is deemed to be extremely
sensitive, especially since many of these operations are directed against
friends and allies of the United States.
For example, the Special Collection
Service (SCS), the secretive joint CIA-NSA clandestine
SIGINT organization
based in Beltsville, Maryland, now operates more than 65 listening posts
inside U.S. embassies and consulates around the world.
While recent media
reports have focused on the presence of SCS listening posts in certain Latin
America capitals, intelligence sources confirm that most of the
organization's resources have been focused over the past decade on the
Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia.
For example, virtually every U.S.
embassy in the Middle East now hosts a SCS SIGINT station that monitors,
twenty-four hours a day, the complete spectrum of electronic communications
traffic within a one hundred mile radius of the embassy site.
The biggest
problem that the SCS currently faces is that it has no presence in some of
the U.S. intelligence community's top targets, such as Iran and North Korea,
because the U.S. government has no diplomatic relations with these
countries.
At the same time, SIGINT coming from the NSA has
become a crucial means whereby the CIA can not only validate the
intelligence it gets from its oftentimes unreliable agents, but SIGINT has
been, and remains the lynchpin underlying the success over the past nine
years of the CIA's secret unmanned drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and
elsewhere around the world.
But the biggest changes have occurred in the
CIA's human intelligence (HUMINT) collection efforts on behalf of NSA.
Over
the past decade, foreign government telecommunications and computer systems
have become one of the most important targeting priorities of the CIA's
National Clandestine Service (NCS), which since the spring of this year has
been headed by one of the agency's veteran Africa and Middle East hands.
The
previous director, Michael J. Sulick, is widely credited with making HUMINT
collection against foreign computer and telecommunications systems one of
the service's top priority targets after he rose to the top of the NCS in
September 2007.
Today, a cadre of several hundred CIA NCS case
officers, known as Technical Operations Officers, have been recruited and
trained to work exclusively on penetrating foreign communications and
computer systems targets so that NSA can gain access to the information
stored on or transmitted by these systems.
Several dozen of these officers
now work fulltime in several offices at NSA headquarters at Fort George G.
Meade, something which would have been inconceivable prior to 9/11.
CIA operatives have also intensified their
efforts to recruit IT specialists and computer systems operators employed by
foreign government ministries, major military command headquarters staffs,
big foreign multinational corporations, and important international
non-governmental organizations.
Since 9/11, the NCS has also developed a variety
of so-called "black boxes" which can quickly crack computer passwords,
bypass commercially-available computer security software systems, and clone
cellular telephones - all without leaving a trace.
To use one rudimentary
example, computer users oftentimes forget to erase default accounts and
passwords when installing a system, or incorrectly set protections on
computer network servers or e-mail accounts. This is a vulnerability which
operatives now routinely exploit.
For many countries in the world, especially in
the developing world, CIA operatives can now relatively easily obtain
telephone metadata records, such as details of all long distance or
international telephone calls, through secret liaison arrangements with
local security services and police agencies.
America's European allies are a different story.
While the connections between the NSA and, for example, the British signals
intelligence service GCHQ are well-documented, the CIA has a harder time
obtaining personal information of British citizens.
The same is true in
Germany, Scandinavia and the Netherlands, which have also been most
reluctant to share this sort of data with the CIA.
But the French
intelligence and security services have continued to share this sort of data
with the CIA, particularly in counterterrorism operations. U.S. intelligence officials are generally
comfortable with the new collaboration.
Those I have spoken to over the past
three weeks have only one major concern.
The fear is that details of these
operations, including the identities of the targets covered by these
operations, currently reside in the four laptops reportedly held by Edward
Snowden, who has spent the past three weeks in the transit lounge at Sheremetyevo Airport outside Moscow waiting for his fate to be decided.
Officials at both the CIA and NSA know that the public disclosure of these
operations would cause incalculable damage to U.S. intelligence operations
abroad as well as massive embarrassment to the U.S. government.
If anyone
wonders why the U.S. government wants to get its hands on Edward Snowden and
his computers so badly, this is an important reason why.
