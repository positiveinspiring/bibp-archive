A conscious, pragmatic movement, as well
informed as it is technically competent, pursuing
advanced localism,
post-scarcity and the reduction of disparity, elitism, insidiously
imposed social engineering, and economic interdependency, has little to fear
as it moves forward.
However, as the paradigm-shift exists now -
there lacks any clear vision for the future, or situational awareness of the
present.
Makerspaces, hackerspaces, community labs, and open source collaborations of
all varieties run the risk of being subtly manipulated, their good
intentions and naivety exploited, compartmentalized, and tasked for
diabolical endeavors the individual participants could hardly fathom.
In "Decentralizing
Telecom," it was noted that D.C. hackerspace, HacDC was part of a
crowd-sourced US State Department project to help develop "suitcase
Internet" systems for US-backed opposition movements during the
US-engineered "Arab Spring."
Another such scheme was announced by DARPA in a Wired article titled, "Pentagon's
New Factory - Your DNA" which stated:
A recent call for research by the Pentagons
mad science agency proposes a new program called Living Foundries. The
idea is to use biology as a manufacturing platform to enable on-demand
production of new and high-value materials, devices and capabilities.
In other words, lets engineer life to make
stuff we want.
It continues:
To jumpstart the process, Darpa wants to
open the playing field to people from outside the biological sciences,
recruiting designers, engineers, manufacturers, computer scientists,
academics and anyone else who has an idea.
By democratizing the biological design and
manufacturing process, they hope to speed up the development of a
reliable factory for all sorts of kind-of-living things.
Wired, which has increasingly become a
clearinghouse for Pentagon propaganda aimed at "geek" culture - and even
hosts corporate-financier funded Brookings Institution "fellows" as
contributors, attempts to make DARPA's plans sound exciting and fun.
In reality, DARPA is assembling an arsenal of
biotechnology constructed of various individual parts contributed by
participants who have no idea what they are involved in or the bigger
picture they are helping to shape.
These will be biotechnological implements only
DARPA understands the true configuration and characteristics of, and
implements DARPA and its affiliates alone can wield at will.
This DARPA vacuum has been assimilating the best and brightest the world has
to offer in a similar manner across many disciplines, assembling a vast
wealth of knowledge and technology to be mixed and matched behind the veil
of secrecy.
It is a good bet that all these technologies are
being used for a handful of specific, unknown objectives, and that cover
stories provided by publications like Wired are solely for public
consumption. The atomic bomb was assembled in a similar compartmentalized
fashion, but at a closed-off facility run top-to-bottom by the US
Government.
In this new model, entire segments of the
population are compartmentalized to fulfill certain objectives, with the
final product assembled behind closed doors by DARPA scientists.
Video: James Corbett of
the Corbett Report examines DARPA in depth, noting
the insidious implications the organization's work
poses, and how many have already been manifested.
Corbett warns of the dangers of ignorance and how these
projects are often implemented before anything can be
done to stop them.
He also suggests ways of
"crowd-sourcing" our way out of this danger.
Being aware of this potential danger is essential.
And the sorts of implements DARPA may already
either possess or be working on should give the masses added incentive to
become actively involved in stripping the technological-intellectual
monopolies being cultivated by the global elite.
It is important to get involved locally, but be aware of things unfolding
globally. We must remember that by getting organized, having an acute
situational awareness, and working pragmatically has given the global elite
the immense power they now possess.
It will take the masses getting organized,
having a collective, acute situational awareness, and working pragmatically,
locally, to take that power back.
