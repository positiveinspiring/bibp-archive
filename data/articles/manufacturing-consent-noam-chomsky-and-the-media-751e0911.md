This documentary film explores the political life and ideas of
Noam Chomsky,
a linguist, intellectual, and political activist.
Created by two Canadian
independent filmmakers, it expands on the ideas of Chomsky's earlier book,
Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, which he
co-wrote with Edward S. Herman.
The film presents and illustrates Chomsky's and Herman's propaganda model,
the thesis that corporate media, as profit-driven institutions, tend to
serve and further the agendas of the interests of dominant, elite groups in
the society.
A centerpiece of the film is a long examination into the
history of The New York Times's coverage of Indonesia's invasion and
occupation of East Timor, which Chomsky claims exemplifies the media's
unwillingness to criticize an ally.
Until the release of "The Corporation" (2003), it was the most successful
documentary in Canadian history,
-
playing theatrically in over 300 cities
around the world
-
winning 22 awards
-
appearing in more than 50 international
film festivals
-
being broadcast in over 30 markets
It has also been
translated into a dozen languages.
