The US government has always been the first to
call out other nations with poor track records on human rights abuses.
Invariably they are the two nations viewed most threatening to America's
global hegemony and power - rivals Russia and China. Other loudly criticized
countries are those less powerful Third World nations that most defy US
dominance.
Any nation on earth is at risk of America's
wrath that fights to protect its own self-interest over and above the
American Empire's in a noble effort to minimize economic exploitation in the
plundering of precious natural resources and subjugating and locking its
native population into permanent Third World serfdom.
But any country going against the world's most
powerful nation is automatically deemed an enemy of the Empire and subject
to such labels as axis-of-evil and a serious affront to human rights.
No surprise that countries like,
-
Venezuela
-
Cuba
-
Iran
-
Syria
-
North Korea,
...are all targeted in the crosshairs of the next
war or next regime change living under decades of heavy-handed economic
sanctions designed to break the will of these independent smaller nations
bold enough to resist US aggression, superpower control and full frontal
dominance.
On the other hand, when a country's government
encourages and willingly allows a strong US presence with
active duty
military installations numbering over
1000 globally accompanied by an army of private contractors and
transnational corporations, corrupt dictators with the worst human rights
records in the entire world are merely given a free pass, immune from any US
criticism.
As long as you succumb and are minimally complicit in the raping
and pillaging of your own nation and people by the global bully, be assured
America will have your back and always turn a blind eye to your heinous
crimes against humanity and human rights violations of the most vile kind -
that is until the US ultimately uses you up and turns on you (like it
predictably does with all its past tyrannical friends Mubarak,
Hussein and
Gaddafi just to name a few).
The ethics card is arbitrarily used only out of
self-serving, psychopathic convenience.
Like
the psychopathic corporations
that exploit people around the world into cheap labor bondage, likewise the
psychopathic US government's only interest (aside from its own) is the
corporate interests it is most beholding to and sworn to protect.
Instead of
our government operating,
"of the people, by the people and for the people,"
since 9/11 no longer sworn to uphold the Constitution, the US government is
now sworn to operate in the sole interest "of the corporation, by the
corporation and for the corporation",
...since higher courts have given
corporations all the rights that used to belong to the people.
Lincoln must
be turning over in his grave now to see what his United States have become.
Since 2008 evaluating countries annually
throughout the world on various human rights violations, a UK company
called Maplecroft has
been assessing and ranking nations for the most serious human rights
offenses. In that first year 20 nations were listed as "extreme" offenders.
Freedom of speech, press, religion and movement along with freedom from
death, torture and slavery are all considered basic human rights.
Another
important criteria used is employment and work conditions. A total of 31
indices of measurement were generated to produce 197 individual nations'
scores and rankings from low in human rights violations to medium, high and
extreme.
In December the group
released its 2014 findings
announcing a 70% increase in nations falling into the extreme category of
worst human rights offenders. That original list of 20 rose to an alarming
34 countries this year.
According to Maplecroft, the ten worst offenders of
human rights around the globe in descending order are:
-
Syria
-
Sudan
-
Democratic Republic of Congo
-
Pakistan
-
Somalia
-
Afghanistan
-
Iraq
-
Myanmar
-
Yemen
-
Nigeria
Of all nations assessed, those measured with the most
significant spikes this year in violating human rights are,
-
Syria
-
Egypt
-
Libya
-
Mali
-
Guinea-Bissau
The US falls into the medium range for human
rights while only,
...are
rated low on human rights abuse.
Aside from the already specified ten worst
offenders, other nations classified in the extreme category of abusers are
Mexico and Columbia in the Western Hemisphere largely due to drug cartels, a
number of small African nations along with global giants India, Russia and
China.
Maplecroft puts out its annual findings as valuable information as
much for transnationals considering global expansion and investment as well
as for public consumption. Prior to analyzing this particular data, it then
seems worth exploring other findings and measures that may shed further
light on this complex but important examination of current global trends in
human rights.
Within the spectrum of nations systematically
engaging in state sponsored executions of its own citizens, every year the
US ranks within the top five nations in the world.
Considering that many
states have suspended their policy of executing death row prisoners due to
DNA evidence proving that too many innocent people are convicted, it
reflects an arrogant callousness to go on killing possibly innocent victims
of a broken barbaric system of injustice.
Yet the state of Texas
continues
to lead the way with 514 since 1976, nearly five times the number of the
next state.
The top offender amongst national governments
killing its own population by execution is China, although its secrecy in
refusing to disclose numbers makes for a best guessed estimate of up to 5000
people a year.
Amnesty
International reports that China puts more people to death than
the rest of the world combined. Other countries promoting capital punishment
in recent years include the stalwart US ally Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq,
Iran, Yemen and North Korea.
With more than 2.2 million Americans currently
in prisons, the incarceration
rate of the United States is the highest in the entire world at
743 out of every 100,000 people, comprising 25% of the world's total inmate
population and near four times the rate of the next nation.
All other
countries on earth imprison far less with the next highest nation's rate at
just over 200 out of 100,000 people.
As of late an extremely hot topic in the news is
the international human rights offense of torture. Last week's US Senate
Intelligence Committee's findings are accusing the CIA under
the Bush-Cheney
regime from 2002-2006 of regularly engaging in a litany of appalling,
internationally banned torture techniques on thousands of "war on terror"
detainees.
Though the committee can declassify its own report, it is urging
President Obama to declassify and release the findings to the public
charging the CIA with gross deception in holding back both the frequency and
severity of its torture practices in dozens perhaps hundreds of secret
detainment centers throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, Europe and of
course Guantanamo.
Some of the Congressional report's findings from
its four year investigation were released to McClatchy,
indicating that the CIA had previously lied to the committee in efforts to
cover up its widespread use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" that
included,
-
waterboarding
-
electrode shock to genitals
-
ripping out of
fingernails
-
hanging upside down for hours on end
Predictably
the CIA still insists that its
methods never constituted torture nor were ever illegal.
But the Senate
findings refute the CIA's claims, concluding that the CIA willfully evaded
all oversight mechanisms operating without approval from either the
Department of Justice or even its own CIA headquarters. The bottom line to
all the torture and abuse inflicted on so many innocent victims throughout
the world is that the US produced next to no useful information in its war
on terror.
Back in 2004 when General David Petraeus was
first sent to Iraq to train Iraqi security forces, he was directly involved
in Iraqi death squad commando units marauding through city streets engaging
in sectarian killings and operating hundreds of police commando centers for
torture and death.
The story broke in March last year when the Guardian and
BBC Arabic released a documentary with both American officers and Iraqi
generals and government officials interviewed linking and implicating
Petraeus' direct and active involvement.
The Pentagon assigned to Iraq an infamous
veteran of the 1980's dirty wars in El Salvador and the Iran-Contra fiasco,
an American Army colonel named James Steele to help train, consult and
coordinate systematic murder, detainment and torture of thousands of Iraqis,
many innocent civilians, contributing to Iraq's descent into full blown
sectarian civil war.
Another Army officer, Colonel Coffman, who
reported directly to Petraeus, worked in unison with Colonel Steele in
setting up Iraqi death squad commando units.
Torture has always been
believed to be a useful military tactic in counterinsurgency warfare to
learn critical information about the enemy. So it was simply business as
usual to the one who literally wrote the book on US counterinsurgency (the
COIN Manual).
The fact that conducting such torture in murderous dirty wars
constitutes serious Geneva and human rights violations made no difference to
the general, the Pentagon that sent the dirty war expert to Iraq, or the
Bush administration that endorsed the use of torture and Iraqi death squads.
A spokesman for the ex-CIA Director Petraeus
last year responded to the charges stating that everything the general
learned and knew was passed onto to his chain of command in Washington as
well as to top Iraqi leadership, thereby deploying the typical CYA strategy,
when in doubt conveniently spread the blame onto others in order to make
yourself look least bad.
Clearly Bush, Cheney and Defense Secretary
Donald
Rumsfeld all knew international laws that expressly forbid torture were
being regularly violated.
But then as proven liars and war criminals many
times over, what else can be expected?
In the face of this latest incriminating
evidence from the Senate, even the CIA's historic ally and protector the
Intelligence Committee chair Diane Feinstein believes the CIA has finally
gone too far.
Of course she only admitted this last month upon learning the
CIA bugged her own committee. But up until that moment she had given
the NSA
and CIA carte blanche rights, endorsing all the invasive unconstitutional
surveillance that for years has been systematically tracking all Americans.
And only when she too felt violated herself did she begin to criticize the
CIA at all.
Clearly these latest revelations show that the
CIA systematically disregarded all protocol as well as international and
Geneva convention rules prohibiting torture and inhumane treatment of
detainees.
The Abu Ghraib prison scandal in 2005 Iraq was just one tip of
the iceberg, illustrating high profile example of US human rights abuses
that have long been embedded as standard US foreign policy throughout the
Middle East and North Africa.
But since those in the CIA, Pentagon and
Washington all lie for a living every single day, the American public is not
so naïve as to actually believe that the brutally illegal US torture
practices ended in 2006.
After all, a recent
poll found that Americans believe that 75% of US politicians are
corrupted by campaign donations and lobbyists. And with his track record,
there is little reason to think anything has changed under Obama who from
the get-go campaigned on the false promise to close down Guantanamo prison.
But of course it is still operating today and in all likelihood so are all
those secret hidden unlawful US torture chambers around the world. Torture
is as serious a human rights violation as any, and in this regard,
undoubtedly the United States is guilty amongst the world's worst offenders.
In 2012 the Committee to Protect Journalists
ranked the most censored
nations in suppressing and imprisoning journalists to include
many of the same top offenders in human rights already identified in other
studies earlier.
They are,
-
North Korea
-
Syria
-
Iran
-
Saudi Arabia
-
Myanmar
But the
Obama administration is gravely
undermining freedom of press here in America as well.
Last year by
aggressively harassing and threatening formal arrest of a number of AP
reporters, confiscating computers and phone records, placing even mainstream
journalists under high surveillance, Obama sent a clear message to
independent journalists that printing the truth that might incriminate the
US government will be met with severe negative consequences.
Obama also
failed to deliver on his campaign promise for transparency that he was
elected on.
His policy of secrecy and intimidation toward those responsible
for accurate news coverage is only surpassed by his policy of violating
whistleblowers' rights, harassing, demonizing and charging them with
violating the espionage
act more than all other previous administrations combined.
In summary of the above findings, since,
-
the US
has chiefly been responsible for escalating the civil war in Syria by
financing and arming America's supposed enemy al Qaeda to overthrow Syrian
leader Assad
-
is also responsible for the 2011 regime changes in both Libya
and Egypt leaving those two nations in chaotic shambles
-
already spent
well over 4 trillion dollars draining the US economy while laying waste to
both Afghanistan and Iraq in decade long wars, leaving the nations in far
worse shape than prior to US invasion and occupation,
...a solid case can be
made that the United States is also a major human rights offender.
Additionally, with frequent drone strikes
killing innocent civilians in our supposed ally Pakistan along with Somalia
and Yemen (latest Yemen estimate 300-430 deaths),
America bears much of the blame for the majority of these most notorious
human rights offenders.
It should be noted that many of these nations have
maintained poor track records long before any major US intervention. But
with all the human tragedy that such an aggressive US foreign policy has
caused in the majority of these worst human rights offenders, US culpability
has made life far worse for citizens living in most top 10 human rights
violating nations.
After all, in Iraq alone the US has killed a
million and a half of its citizens.
With the sectarian civil war in Iraq
that the US created still raging, at least 4000 more deaths each year
continue nonstop to this day, destroying property into the billions, surging
rates of cancer and birth defects that have left still floundering economies
led by corrupt weak puppet governments.
The sheer and utter destruction the
US has brought to so many of the globe's most notorious human rights
offenders, with no sign of improvement, merely adds another dark blemish to
the already overwhelming evidence that America has miserably failed every
nation where it intervenes.
But despite inflicting so much pain and
devastation on so many nations' populations around the world, regularly
violating their sovereign rights, the February coup
in Ukraine the latest
example, while breaking every international law, Geneva Convention and UN
Charter rule, an overwhelming case can be mounted against the United States
as the planet's worst human rights violator of them all.
That is why when Obama accuses Russia and China
of unjustified unilateral military aggression, defying and violating all
international laws, disregarding other nations' sovereignties, and
maintaining horrendous human rights records, the entire world laughs at
America's blatant hypocrisy and double standard.
Since the US has enjoyed it
sole global superpower status for near a quarter century now, it has
relentlessly taken advantage of less powerful nations citing US
exceptionalism as its inflated sense of entitlement and self-justification.
The US as the world's bully can commit transgression after transgression
anywhere on earth whenever it wants with complete impunity and
unaccountability because its Empire dominance and strength permit getting
away with it.
A quick final review places America near the top
in killing and at the top in locking up its own citizens, especially if they
are darker-skinned.
It also ranks number one in the world in killing
foreigners as well as ranks very high torturing those same foreigners
especially if they happen to be darker-skinned non-Christians.
Based on
recent global events, the US has threatened and bullied the rest of the
world into submission for so long now that the tables may finally be
turning. It appears that the geopolitical chessboard might have America the
big loser when the petrodollar no longer rules. Russian President Putin is
currently seeking to set the precedent to trade in rubles.
As America's
chief creditor, China along with Russia are leading the revolt to overthrow
the US dollar as the standard international currency. Europe usually gives
into US demands but needs Russia's natural gas piped in more than it does
America's war with Russia.
Obama's latest war drumming rhetoric and
negative sanctions simply may not stick.
The US government's long history of
violating others' human rights justified by its own inflated sense of
entitlement and exceptionalism appears to be rapidly catching up, and soon
American citizens may be joining the rest of the world paying a very heavy
price for the sins of its leaders.
