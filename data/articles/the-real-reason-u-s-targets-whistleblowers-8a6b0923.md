# The REAL Reason U.S. Targets Whistleblowers

The deeper threat that leakers such as
Manning and Snowden pose is more subtle than a direct assault on U.S.
national security: they undermine
Washingtons ability to act hypocritically and get away with it.
Their
danger lies not in the new information that they reveal but in the
documented confirmation they provide of what the United States is
actually doing and why.
When these
deeds turn out to clash with the governments public rhetoric, as they
so often do, it becomes harder for U.S. allies to overlook Washingtons
covert behavior and easier for U.S. adversaries to justify
their own.

As the United States finds itself less able
to deny the gaps between its actions and its words, it will face
increasingly difficult choices - and may ultimately be compelled to
start practicing what it preaches.
Hypocrisy
is central to Washingtons soft power - its ability to get other
countries to accept the legitimacy of its actions - yet few
Americans appreciate its role.
***
American commitments to the rule of law,
democracy, and free trade are embedded in the multilateral institutions
that the country helped establish after World War II, including
the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
the United Nations, and later the World Trade Organization.
Despite recent challenges to U.S.
preeminence, from
the Iraq war to
the financial crisis, the
international order remains an American one.
This system needs the lubricating oil
of hypocrisy to keep its gears turning.
***
Of course, the United States has gotten away
with hypocrisy for some time now. It has long preached the virtues of
nuclear nonproliferation, for example, and has coerced some states into
abandoning their atomic ambitions.
At the same time, it tacitly accepted
Israels nuclearization and, in 2004, signed a formal deal affirming
Indias right to civilian nuclear energy despite its having flouted the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by acquiring nuclear weapons.
In a similar vein, Washington talks a good
game on democracy, yet it stood by as the Egyptian military overthrew an
elected government in July, refusing to call a coup a coup.
Then theres the "war on terror": Washington
pushes foreign governments hard on human rights but claims sweeping
exceptions for its own behavior when it feels its safety is threatened.
***
Mannings and Snowdens leaks mark the
beginning of a new era in which the U.S. government can no longer count
on keeping its secret behavior secret.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans today
have access to classified documents that would embarrass the country if
they were publicly circulated. As the recent revelations show, in the
age of the cell-phone camera and the flash drive, even the most
draconian laws and reprisals will not prevent this information from
leaking out.
As a result, Washington faces what can be
described as an accelerating hypocrisy
collapse - a dramatic narrowing of the countrys room to maneuver
between its stated aspirations and its sometimes sordid pursuit of
self-interest.
The U.S. government, its friends, and its
foes can no longer plausibly deny the dark side of U.S. foreign policy
and will have to address it head-on.
***
The era of easy hypocrisy is over.
