# Australian Opposition Calls for TPP Text to Be Made Public

Labor spokesperson for Trade, Senator
Penny Wong, has called on the Coalition government to release the
full text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement before it is
signed by Australia, in order to assure that the government isn't
signing away the country's rights in areas including copyright.
The
TPP agreement is a currently being negotiated
between,
-
Australia
-
the US
-
Canada
-
Japan
-
Mexico
-
Peru
-
Vietnam
-
Malaysia
-
Brunei
-
Chile
-
New Zealand
-
Singapore,
...aimed at simplifying trade between the 12
nations.
The negotiations have been held
confidential, and text of the agreement has not been made public. DFAT
trade negotiation officials said in Senate Estimates last week that it
is standard practice for international agreements to be negotiated in
private with the text not made public until the agreement has been
finalized.
However, last month, an
August draft of the text of one of the most controversial and
still-outstanding chapters of the agreement, the intellectual property
chapter, was leaked by whistleblowing website Wikileaks.
Critics of the TPP agreement
have warned that the draft text indicates Australia could be signing
up for significant new penalties for users caught sharing
copyright-infringing material online, and potentially new obligations
for ISPs to enforce copyright for the rights holders.
The draft text that was leaked was said to
be from August, back when Labor was still in government in Australia,
under the oversight of Richard Marles. ZDNet understands that
negotiators haven't been told to change their position on any
copyright-related parts of the TPP agreement under the new Coalition
Government.
However, in
an opinion piece published today, Wong has now indicated that Labor
has its reservations about the TPP agreement.
"The test for the government in TPP -
and all other trade - negotiations is ensuring Australia's national
interest is never traded away," she said.
"[It would not] be in the national
interest for the government to sign up to the TPP if it mandated a
radical shift in the legal balance between creators and users of
protected works."
Trade Minister Andrew Robb is
currently in Singapore with the trade ministers from other nations
currently part of the negotiations seeking to get the agreement
finalized and signed before the end of 2013.
Wong called on the full text of the
agreement to be released before it is signed by the Australian
government (or ANY other government...).
"There is a national interest in the
government providing the transparency that enables Australians to
understand what trade agreements mean, what benefits they bring, and
what compromises we are being asked to make, and the TPP is no
exception," Wong said.
"Labor believes the full text of any
proposed TPP should be released well before it is signed. That is
the commitment the United States trade representative has given to
Congress, and the Australian Parliament and people are entitled to
no less."
Although the Labor government would have had
access to the draft of the text, and did not release it prior to the
election, a spokesperson for Wong told ZDNet that the main concern was
what was in the final text, which would be vastly different to what was
included in the drafts.
