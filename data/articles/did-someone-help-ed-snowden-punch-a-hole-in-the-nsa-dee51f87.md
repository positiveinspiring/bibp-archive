Ed
Snowden, NSA leaker. Honest man. Doing what was right. Bravo.
That still doesnt preclude the possibility that, unknown to him, he was
managed by people to put him the right place to
expose NSA secrets.
Snowdens exposure of NSA was a righteous act, because that agency is a RICO
criminal. But that doesnt mean we have the whole story.
How many people work in classified jobs for the NSA? And here is one man,
Snowden, who is working
for Booz Allen, an outside contractor, but
is assigned to NSA, and he can get access to, and copy, documents that
expose the spying collaboration between NSA and the biggest tech companies
in the world - and he can get away with it.
If so, then NSA is a sieve leaking out of all holes. Because that means a
whole lot of other, higher NSA employees can likewise steal these documents.
Many, many other people can copy them and take them. Poof.
If the NSA is not a sieve, its quite correct to suspect Snowden, a
relatively low-level man, was guided and helped.
Does that diminish what Snowden accomplished? No. But it casts it in a
different light.
Or you can believe a scenario like this:
Mr. Snowden, Im closing up now for the
day. Do you need anything before I go?
No thanks, Sarah, Ill be staying late tonight.
NSA isnt a little community bank or a liquor
store. We arent talking about an employee with a printer and a file folder
to hold top-secret pieces of paper he carries in a briefcase out of the
office on his way home.
If there are people who arranged Snowdens access to NSA secrets, without
him knowing it, theyll be obscured by the maze of partisan political
squabbling and Congressional idiots holding hearings.
Between these morons and the press, the public will be treated, night and
day, to the following: Can Snowden be extradited back here? Is he a
terrorist? Should those giant tech companies have agreed to supply the
government with information on private citizens? If so, how much
information? etc., etc. Diversions. False trails.
To understand who might have been behind Snowden, we first need to
understand the real reach of the Surveillance State.
The Surveillance State has created an apparatus whose implications are
staggering. Its a different world now. And sometimes it takes a writer of
fiction to flesh out the larger landscape.
Brad Thors novel, Black List, posits the existence of a
monster corporation,
ATS, that stands along side the NSA in
collecting information on every move we make. ATS intelligence-gathering
capability is unmatched anywhere in the world.
At his site,
www.BradThor.com, the author lists some of
the open-source material he discovered that formed the basis for Black List.
The material, as well as the novel, is worth reading.
On pages 117-118 of Black List, Thor makes a stunning inference that,
on reflection, is as obvious as the fingers on your hand:
For years ATS [substitute NSA] had been
using its technological superiority to conduct massive insider trading.
Since the early 1980s, the company had spied
on anyone and everyone in the financial world. They listened in on phone
calls, intercepted faxes, and evolved right along with the technology,
hacking internal computer networks and e-mail accounts.
They created mountains of black dollars
for themselves, which they washed through various programs they were
running under secret contract, far from the prying eyes of financial
regulators.
Those black dollars were invested into hard assets around the world, as
well as in the stock market, through sham, offshore corporations. They
also funneled the money into reams of promising R&D projects, which
eventually would be turned around and sold to the Pentagon or the CIA.
In short, ATS had created its own license to print money and had
assured itself a place beyond examination or reproach.
In real life, whether the prime criminal source
is one monster corporation or the NSA itself, the outcome would be the same.
Total surveillance has unlimited payoffs when it targets financial markets
and the people who have intimate knowledge of them.
Total security awareness programs of
surveillance are ideal spying ops in the financial arena, designed to grab
millions of bits of inside information, and then utilize them to make
investments and suck up billions (trillions?) of dollars.
It gives new meaning to the rich get richer.
Taking the overall scheme to another level, consider this: those same heavy
hitters (NSA) who have unfettered access to financial information can also
choose, at opportune moments, to expose certain scandals and crimes.
In this way, they can, at their whim, cripple governments, banks, and
corporations. They can cripple investment houses, insurance companies, and
hedge funds. Or, alternatively, they can merely blackmail these
organizations.
Its likely that the probe Ron Paul has been pushing - audit
the
Federal Reserve - has already been done by those who control
unlimited global surveillance. They already know far more than any
Congressional investigation will uncover. If they know the deepest truths,
they can use them to blackmail, manipulate, and control the Fed itself.
Corruption on top of corruption.
In this global-surveillance world, we need to ask new questions and think
along different lines now.
For example,
-
How long before the mortgage-derivative
crisis hit did the Masters of Surveillance know, from spying on bank
records, that insupportable debt was accumulating at a lethal pace?
-
What did they do with that information?
-
When did they know that at least a
trillion dollars was missing from Pentagon accounting books (as
Donald Rumsfeld eventually admitted on 9/10/2001), and what did they
do with that information?
-
Did they discover precisely where the
trillion dollars went?
-
Did they discover where billions of
dollars, in cash, shipped to post-war Iraq, disappeared to?
-
When did they know the details of the
Libor rate-fixing scandal? Press reports indicate that Barclays was
trying to rig interest rates as early as January 2005.
-
Have they tracked, in detail, the men
responsible for recruiting hired mercenaries and terrorists, who
eventually wound up in Syria pretending to be an authentic rebel
force?
-
Have they discovered the truth about how
close or how far away Iran is from producing a nuclear weapon?
-
Have they collected detailed accounts of
the most private plans of
Bilderberg,
CFR, and
Trilateral Commission leaders?
For global surveillance kings, what we think of
as the future is, in many respects the present and the past.
Its a new world. These overseers of universal information-detection can
enter and probe the most secret caches of data, collect, collate, cross
reference, and assemble them into vital bottom-lines.
By comparison, an
operation like Wikileaks is an old Model-T Ford puttering down a
country road, and Julian Assange is a mere piker.
Previously, we thought we needed to look over the shoulders of the men who
were committing major crimes out of public view. But now, if we want to be
up to date, we also have to factor in the men who are spying on those
criminals, who are gathering up those secrets and using them to commit their
own brand of meta-crime.
And in the financial arena, that means we think of Goldman Sachs and JP
Morgan as perpetrators, yes, but we also think about the men who already
know everything about GS and Morgan, and are using this knowledge to steal
sums that might make GS and Morgan blush with envy.
Therefore
when looking for who might have helped Ed Snowden punch a hole in
NSA, we should think about who the NSA has been spying on. Not the little
guy, not the medium-sized guy, but a very big guy. Perhaps a Goldman Sachs
or a JP Morgan.
At the highest levels of criminal power, the players dont always
agree. Its not always a smooth conspiracy. There is fierce in-fighting as
well.
Goldman Sachs, Chase, and Morgan consider trillion-dollar trading markets
their own private golden-egg farm. They run it, they own it, they manipulate
it for their own ends.
If NSA has been looking over their shoulders for the past 30 years,
discovering all their knowledge, and operating a meta invasion, siphoning
off enormous profits, NSA would rate as Enemy Number One.
And would need to be torpedoed.
Enter Ed Snowden...
Looking elsewhere, consider this. Snowden worked for the CIA. He was pushed
up the ranks quickly, from an IT position in the U.S. to a posting in
Geneva, under diplomatic cover, to run security on the CIAs computer
systems there.
Then, Snowden quit the CIA and eventually ended up at Booz Allen, a
private contractor. He was assigned to NSA, where he stole the secrets and
exposed
the NSA.
The CIA
and NSA have a long contentious relationship. The major issue is, who is
king of US intelligence? Were talking about an internal war. Snowden could
have been the CIAs man at NSA, where certain CIA players helped him access
files he wouldnt have been able to tap otherwise.
You can bet your bottom dollar that NSA analysts are looking into this
possibility right now.
