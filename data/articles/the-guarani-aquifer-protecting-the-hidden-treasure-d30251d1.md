The Guarani
aquifer - a vast subterranean aquifer located in
Southeastern South America - has recently become
a contested site for resource management.
Lying beneath
four countries and holding the possibility to
sustain humanitys basic need for potable water
for generations to come, the delineation between
national, regional and international
jurisdiction, profit and sustainability, remain
worryingly unclear and uncertain.
Local
authorities, together with the international
community, are facing a collective action
problem.

A vast water
reserve for a thirsty world
The Guarani aquifer, named after the
Guarani first nation, is a large drinkable water reserve with a 1.2
million sq. km. extension spanning across four countries:
In spite of its size (it would
represent, for example, about 77% of the Quebecs territory) the
aquifer is invisible to the naked eye since it is subterranean. In
fact, at issue is an old geological structure; an extremely big rock
soaked in water.
This aquifer suggests itself as a very
important strategic resource in light of global concerns regarding
drinkable water.
Considering that only 3% of the worlds
water is potable, and that a mere 21% of it is easily extractable
(as the rest is frozen in both poles, glaciers, and on mountains
peaks), humanity is shifting its focus towards the sustainable
exploitation of alternative resources, specifically subterranean
water reserves.
Though surface-level drinkable water is
easily obtained, it represents only 1% of total potable water and is
also mostly contaminated.
At present, more than 40% of the global
population (3,600 million) does not have regular access to safe
sources of potable water, and this number is expected to rise as
climate change, pollution and population growth put increased strain
on water resources. The scarcity of this resource takes its highest
toll on the most vulnerable segment of society: 4,000 children die
daily due to dehydration, diarrhea, and other illnesses related to
contaminated water.1
As a water resource, the Guarani aquifer
has enormous potential. Its volume reaches about 40,000 cubic km (Km3),
with each cubic kilometer containing one billion liters of water, or
enough to supply about 28 million homes per year in an average
American city.
Though only 40 to 80 cu km could be
exploited from the aquifer, it is still quite a considerable amount.2
It is also worth noting that the aquifer
is a renewable water source, since over 166 yearly cu. km are
obtained from rain that feeds the resource through certain water
areas located mostly in Argentina, as well as from soil humidity.
Many protectors,
one legacy
There is no doubt that the Guarani
Aquifer is a precious resource that must be protected for the
benefit of future generations.
One of the major threats it faces is
linked to the aquifers surface, which is predominantly used for
farming and live stock. Irresponsible waste management, fertilizers,
and other agrochemical products are very likely to filter through
the inner rivers and transitional water deposits, contaminating the
reservoirs core.
Climate change could also affect the
required humidity level by reducing the moisture on the surface and
complicating the waters circulation from the outside to the inside
of the aquifer.
Another less evident but equally
important hazard to consider is irresponsible water extraction,
which has two lethal consequences:
-
an increase in the salt level
-
a general lack of pressure
With regard to the first, salted water
only currently represents 10% of the water reserve but negligent
extraction could negatively affect this delicate proportion,
rendering the water undrinkable.
Regarding the second, the existing
pressure grade eases water pumping to the surface, but random
extraction could render the extraction process impossible in the
near future - or at least make it much more expensive than it
currently is - as low water levels in secondary pools negatively
affect the pressure of the whole aquifer.
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay
(founding members of Mercosur, the common South American market)
understand the magnitude of the situation and have decided to take
action. In 2004, these four countries declared full sovereignty over
the aquifer and assumed shared responsibilities in order to preserve
it.
These responsibilities include:
It seems, however, that these measures
do not extend past good intentions. Irresponsible exploitation
continues to this day, as perforations are thought to allow
contaminants into the aquifer. There is also evidence that in
certain Brazilian areas more pressure than ever before is needed to
extract potable water.
Brazil already has 300 perforation
pumps, Paraguay 200, Uruguay 135 and Argentina only 6.
The distressing side of this story is
that in these countries potable water coverage only reaches on
average 75% of the total population, as the remaining 25% is dealing
with alternative sources that could be unsafe.
If properly managed, the Guarani
Aquifer, then, could become an excellent regional resource that
benefits far more people than at present.
The S.A.G.
Project
In May 2003
the World Bank (WB) met with the
Mercosur countries in Uruguay in order to start up the Sistema
Aquifero Guarani -
Guarani Aquifer System or SAG
project, a $26.7 million plan for the aquifer, funded jointly by the
World Bank - WB (50% of total investment) and the four Mercosur
countries (45%).
The remaining part of the project was
financed by the Dutch and German governments, together with the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organization of
American States.
The WBs rationale for intervening in
the Guarani aquifer was chosen over two other alternatives: do
nothing, or carry the project on an exclusively national basis in
one or two countries. Whereas the first one was rejected due to
initial signs of stress on the resource, the second alternative was
rejected on the basis that the regional nature of the aquifer
naturally implies that its continued degradation in one country will
impact on all the other countries. 3
The S.A.G. project is still in an
initial phase and, for now, consists of gathering information in
order to determine the aquifers potential and securing its
protection from the aforementioned hazards.
However, the idea behind the WBs
initial approach is to determine what would be the most efficient
way to utilize the aquifer. In terms of efficiency, extractions from
the aquifer do not yield pure water alone; they also contain stone
and sand.
Therefore a more technologically
advanced decantation process would help obtain a better quality and
quantity of water. And examining the outflow and inflow zones would
help to locate the best extraction areas, not to mention that better
- and thus more expensive - pumping procedures could avoid
introducing contaminants into the aquifer.
There are concerns that this initial
phase of the SAG project could lead to a second phase involving the
exploitation of the aquifer by multinational companies like,
...the principal international players
within
the water 'market.'
This suspicion is based on the pattern
of WB-supported private investment previously experienced throughout
Latin America.4
There are therefore valid concerns that
in the name of efficiency and conservation, the administration of
the aquifer would in fact transform it into a for-profit private
business under the rationale that the aquifer is being squandered by
local governments that cannot ensure its protection.
Concerns about the privatization of
water were reflected in the words of Stefano Pagiola, Senior
Environmental Economist in the World Banks Policy and Economics
Team.
In the World Water Forum 2006 bulletin
he explained that the concept of payment for environmental services
is based,
on two principles: users must pay
for the environmental services they enjoy, and suppliers must be
compensated for delivering them. It is a win-win situation
insofar as it is based on common interests, and identified
efficiency and sustainability as its main benefits.5
A dangerous
dilemma
When it comes to the administration of
public resources, Mercosurs countries have a negative track record,
due in large part to a decades-long legacy of political instability
and corruption.
In the case of the Guarani, no other
important political step has been taken other than reaffirming their
shared sovereignty over the aquifer. Yet, exploitation happens at
the surface level where jurisdiction of the aquifer is not shared
and countries individually affect the water resource.
Furthermore, budgets from these
countries are either very tight or they do not reflect any serious
intention aimed at exploring better drilling zones to protect the
aquifer.
The WBs monetary support, though
appreciated, could be aimed to bridge the gap between private
multinational investors and the aquifer resources. Even with an
increase in the efficiency of the aquifers management, if potable
water is to be obtained by for-profit organizations, it could very
easily be turned into a commodity and its access more restricted
than before.
It seems that we either,
-
risk the survival of the aquifer
in the hands of countries with high corruption levels
-
or we let private companies take
over this vital resource, possibly leaving those most in
need out of the equation
Equilibrium between these two
alternatives needs to be attained by letting the Mercosur countries
administer the Guarani aquifer themselves, since their
responsibility and legal rights over the resource are inalienable.
The international community should
participate not by promoting privatization, but rather by helping
these countries control their resource and create legal standards to
manage exploitation and make potable water more accessible to all.
The preservation of the Guarani aquifer is vital for humanity, yet
it is a treasure that risks slipping through our fingers if we are
not careful.
It is a treasure that must be protected
yet shared at the same time, not just for the benefit of Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, but for the benefit of the entire
world and the generations to come.

"The Guaraní
Aquifer... is one of the world's largest aquifer
systems... It is said that this vast underground
reservoir could supply fresh drinking water to
the world for 200 years."
"US President
George W. Bush
allegedly has recently purchased a 98,842 acre
farm in Chaco, Paraguay atop the aquifer. The
Reverend Moon has also purchased 1,482,600 acres
in Chaco, Paraguay."
The Guaraní Aquifer, located beneath the
surface of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, is one of the
world's largest aquifer systems and is an important source of fresh
water.
Named after the Guaraní tribe, it covers
1,200,000 km², with a volume of about 40,000 km³, a thickness of
between 50 m and 800 m and a maximum depth of about 1,800 m.
It is estimated to contain about 37,000 km³ of water (arguably the
largest single body of groundwater in the world, although the
overall volume of the constituent parts of the Great Artesian Basin
is much larger), with a total recharge rate of about 166 km³/year
from precipitation.
It is said that this vast underground
reservoir could supply fresh drinking water to the world for 200
years.
Due to an expected shortage of fresh
water on a global scale, which environmentalists suggest will become
critical in under 20 years, this important natural resource is
rapidly becoming politicized, and the control of the resource
becomes ever more controversial.
