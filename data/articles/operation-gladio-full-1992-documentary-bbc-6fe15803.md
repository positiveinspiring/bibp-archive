Originally aired on BBC2 in 1992, 'Operation Gladio' reveals 'Gladio', the
secret state-sponsored terror network operating in Europe.
This BBC series is about a far-right secret army, operated by the CIA and
MI6 through NATO, which killed hundreds of innocent Europeans and attempted
to blame the deaths on Baader Meinhof, Red Brigades and other left wing
groups.
Known as 'stay-behinds' these armies were given access to military
equipment which was supposed to be used for sabotage after a Soviet
invasion. Instead it was used in massacres across mainland Europe as part of
a CIA Strategy of Tension.
Gladio killing sprees in Belgium and Italy were
carried out for the purpose of frightening the national political classes
into adopting U.S. policies.
