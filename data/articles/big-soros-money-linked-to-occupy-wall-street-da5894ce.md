Labor unions, communists, community organizers, socialists, and
anti-capitalist agitators have
all joined together to Occupy Wall Street
and protest against greed, corporations, and bankers.
But despite efforts to portray the movement as
leaderless or grassroots, it is becoming obvious that there is much more
going on behind the scenes than meets the eye.
Billionaire financier
George Soros fingerprints, for example, have
been all over the anti-Wall Street campaign from the very beginning.
And this week, the infamous hedge-fund boss
publicly announced his sympathy for the
protesters and their complaints about bailouts - despite the fact that he
lobbied for even greater unconstitutional handouts to bankers in 2009.
Actually I can understand their sentiment,
frankly, he told reporters while announcing a large donation to the
United Nations. I can sympathize with their grievances.
But Soros support for the protesters goes far
beyond his tepid public statements.
In fact, the original call to Occupy Wall
Street
came from the magazine AdBusters, an
anti-consumerist publication financed by, among other sources, the
Soros-funded Tides Foundation.
Other Soros-backed outfits promoting big government - some with myriad ties
to the Obama administration - are also publicly driving the occupation
campaign.
MoveOn.org, for instance, has received millions of dollars from
the billionaire banker.
And now, the group is urging its supporters to
join the
Occupy Wall Street movement as well.
Over the last two weeks, an amazing wave of
protest against Wall Street and the big banks has erupted across the
country, MoveOn said in a recent e-mail to supporters, praising the
brave demonstrators.
On Wednesday, MoveOn members will join labor and
community groups in New York City for a huge march down to the protest
site - the biggest yet.
On top of supplying activists to join the
demonstrations, MoveOn is also staging what it calls a massive Virtual
March on Wall Street online.
The Internet-based demonstrations are a
collaborative effort with another radical and well-connected outfit tied to
Soros called
Rebuild the Dream.
Led by self-described communist and former Obama administration czar Van
Jones, the Dream movement is a
partnership between a host of
Soros-financed progressive groups.
Big Labor and even Planned Parenthood - the
largest abortion provider in America, which
receives hundreds of millions of tax dollars each year - are partners,
too.
Together, we'll add hundreds of thousands
of voices of solidarity from the American Dream Movement for the
protests across the country and show just how widespread outrage at the
Wall Street banks really is, MoveOn boasted in its e-mail.
Other groups working with Rebuild the Dream are
also publicly hyping the demonstrations. And more than a few of them are on
the Soros payroll as well.
Some examples
include,
-
People For The American Way
-
Planned Parenthood
-
Campaign For America's Future
-
Democracy For America
-
Leadership Conference for Civil and
Human Rights
-
Common Cause
-
Public Campaign,
...and many more.
Soros, of course, has a long history of financing organizations targeting
the American system of government. He has also served on the board of the
immensely influential global-governance-promoting
Council on Foreign
Relations.
Just last year,
Soros claimed that the brutal communist
dictatorship ruling mainland China should lead what he calls the New World
Order. The Chinese tyrants, meanwhile, have also been touting Occupy Wall
Street through the regimes propaganda organs.
But Soros does not love the despots in Beijing for their commitment to
equality or democracy.
Behind Soros and his tens of billions lies
even more wealth and power:
the unimaginably vast Rothschild banking empire.
One of the richest men in the world today, Soros has been in legal trouble
for corruption before - in France, for instance, he was fined more than $2
million for his illegal scheming. So, critics noted, it might seem ironic
that the textbook example of a corrupt financier would finance a protest
supposedly aimed at corrupt financiers.
But the irony hardly ends there.
Union bosses and others intimately linked to President Obama - whose top
campaign contributors included Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup,
and other big banks - are also playing a key role in the Wall Street
protests.
The protesters are even recycling administration
talking points such as the old the rich should be forced to pay their 'fair
share'" - despite the fact that the Buffett rule tax proposal being
advanced would almost exclusively soak what remains of the middle class.
But that might be the point. According to reports and analysts, the whole
anti-Wall Street movement has been carefully orchestrated by the
Obama-linked anti-capitalist union titans and tax-funded community
organizers.
A troubling plot to essentially finish off
capitalism was exposed earlier this year, and at the time it was blasted as
economic terrorism. Even more disturbing: It was uncannily similar to the
growing Wall Street demonstrations.
Community organizer Stephen Lerner of the SEIU, a regular White House
guest, was caught on video in March discussing the scheme to bring down the
stock market and "destabilize" the nation - all with the stated goal of
"redistributing wealth":
Mortgage Strike secret revolt revealed SEIU Lerner
And while the whole conspiracy was not revealed
because Lerner suspected police were present, the strategies he mentioned
included civil disobedience and mass anti-banker protests.
Another conspirator said to be pulling the strings, disgraced ACORN founder
and union boss Wade Rathke, was advocating massive Day of Rage
protests targeting bankers earlier this year. And he is also closely tied to
Obama, who actually used to work for Rathkes community organizing outfit.
ACORN, of course, was
recently exposed engaging in widespread criminal
activity while receiving millions of federal tax dollars. But after the
organization
filed for bankruptcy, its tentacles are taking over under new
names - and still receiving government handouts.
Rathke is also a founding board member of the Soros-funded Tides Foundation,
a key source of money for AdBusters magazine (which first called for the
Wall Street occupation) and countless other anti-business groups. And he is
directly tied to more than a few unions including the SEIU.
Beyond Big Labor and Soros front groups, as critics call them, is also a
vast collection of socialist and Marxist organizations
supporting the
demonstrations.
The Socialist Party USA, the Marxist-oriented
Workers World Party, the International Committee of the Fourth
International, and the Communist Party USA-affiliated Peoples World are all
publicly and openly backing the movement.
While the occupation movement purports to be leaderless, in reality,
critics say its leaders and financiers are barely concealed.
According to analysts, the protests - which are
quickly spreading to cities across the United States, Canada, and Europe -
actually represent a well-orchestrated operation being used by the very same
elite one percent supposedly being protested against.
The official goals remain murky so far, almost certainly not by chance.
But it is becoming increasingly apparent that liberty and honest money are
not among the demands.
Rather, bigger government, higher taxes, and an
end to what remains of the free market system seem to be at the top of the
list.
