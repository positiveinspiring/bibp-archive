# Operation Northwoods and the Events of 9/11 - Excerpts from "Fahrenheit 
24/7: The Further Adventures of Bush & Cheney"

Ever heard of Roberto Calvi?
He was the former president of
Banco
Ambrosiano and one of the principle managers of the
Vaticans
financial affairs - that is, before he was found hanging from the
Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982.
According to journalist
David Yallop in his book In Gods Name, Roberto Calvi once said that if
you wanted to understand "how the world is really run," you need to
read only one book:
-
not the Bible
-
not The Art of War by Sun Tzu
-
not The Prince by Machiavelli
-
but The
Godfather by Mario Puzo
American politicians alternately snipe at one another and protect
one another as well, just like the Mafia.
An example: In 2003 President
Bush blocked the investigation into Clintons last-minute
pardons (known to some as "pardongate"). The U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York didnt even issue a report, despite
the fact that it was a legitimate criminal investigation already
three years old.
When a writer for WorldNetDaily asked
Ari
Fleischer, the presidential press secretary, if Bush was "going to
just drop it," Fleischer replied,
"The president is looking
forwards, not backwards, and I would highly recommend that to you as
well."
Yes, indeed. A most interesting little game is being played
here, is it not?
As a result of my colleagues e-mail, I decided to start writing "A
Brief History of the United States" because I suddenly realized that
a lot of well-meaning people are completely in the dark as to whats
going on here, though the overall scenario seems so clear from an
outsiders perspective. As you no doubt already know, if you want
accurate news about America, refer to foreign sources.
Its not an
accident that the French were onto the 9/11 fraud before any
American journalist.
Speaking of 9/11, this is an important point: On September 11, 1994,
at 1:55 p.m., a "lone nut" named Frank Corden stole a single-engine
Cessna from Aldino Airport in Churchville, Maryland.
Eleven hours
later he rammed it into the Executive Mansion of the White House
where the President and the First Family would normally be sleeping;
however, on that particular evening they were staying elsewhere due
to the fact that the Mansion was undergoing renovations. (Those
gentle little "suggestions" can get pretty serious, cant they?)
The image of that Cessna flying into the White House was the very
first image that entered my mind exactly seven years later on
September 11, 2001.
"Why, we never dreamed that somebody would use a
plane as a weapon. Not even a science fiction writer could have
predicted something as improbable as that!"
Huh? Some freakin "nut" rammed a plane into the White House in 1994 and youre
telling me you never "dreamed" it could happen in 2001?
Those planes were allowed to fly into the World Trade Center in
order to kick-start this war, a war we now know Dick Cheney already
had planned months before 9/11/01.
NO PLANE flew into the Pentagon.
It was a missile or a predator drone.
This fact can be determined
through, among many other means, analyzing the color of the Pentagon
explosion caught on tape (the chemical components of an explosion
resulting from a crashing 757 are significantly different from what
one would find in a missile explosion), footage that can be seen in
the documentary Painful Deceptions by Eric Hufschmid, which is
readily available for purchase at
www.erichufschmid.net.
The roots of
the 9/11 plot can be found in the
Operation Northwoods
document *, an actual plan prepared by the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff in the 1960s to hijack jet airliners, blow up U.S.
military bases, and use paramilitary sniper teams to shoot at
American civilians in the streets of Washington, D.C. and Miami in
order to precipitate a war with Cuba.

Of course, this kind of operation can be traced back much farther.
FOIA documents now prove that President Roosevelt allowed the
invasion of Pearl Harbor to occur in order to draw an isolationist
country into a war it did not want.
This incontrovertible PROOF can
be found in the recent book Day of Deceit by Robert Stinnett (who,
oddly enough, served in the U.S. Navy under Lt. George Bush from
1942 to 1946).
The
events of 9/11/01 were no different. In fact, I
cant think of a major 20th century "conflict" that didnt begin in
a similar manner, including the Spanish-Civil War, WWI, the Korean
War, and Vietnam.
In 1961,
in his farewell speech to the nation,
President Eisenhower
warned of the growing influence of the "military industrial
complex."
He knew full well that monolithic corporations with ties
to the U.S. military were using campaign contributions to exert more
and more control over politicians, who in turn were enacting
restrictive laws to mold the population into fearful automatons who
soon came to believe they had only two choices left to them:
volunteer to give up more and more of their rights, or get killed by
Communists, terrorists, drug dealers, or fatal plagues.
