The embattled Euro has gotten
a surprise boost from an unexpected quarter - China.
The country with the worlds largest
foreign exchange currency reserves, China, has pledged to
support Greek debt as well as the Euro in what is clearly a
geopolitical decision.
In doing so, China has signaled it
seeks to prevent the US financial warfare attack on Europe and
to play the EU off against the USA in a geopolitical chess game
of a fascinating dimension.

Chinese Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, on an
unusual visit to tiny Greece, a country which normally would never warrant
such a high-level visit from the worlds fastest growing economic giant, has
pledged support for Greece and for the Euro.
According to the official Chinese Xinhua News
Agency (and China Daily),
China supports Greece in firmly carrying
out structural reforms and cutting its fiscal deficits to improve
competitiveness. China welcomes the EU and the IMFs rescue package for
Greece and stands ready to help Greece out of recession.
What it means concretely was made clear by Wen
Jiabao at a press conference early October in Athens when he stated,
China is holding Greek bonds and will keep
buying bonds that Greece issues. We will undertake to support eurozone
countries and Greece to overcome the crisis.
The last statement is far the most significant.
It indicates that China has made a strategic decision to counter any future
attempt by US-based hedge funds and banks to attack the weak countries of
the Eurozone, including Ireland, Spain, Portugal or Greece.
Early this year, as we noted at the time, Wall
Street banks such as Goldman Sachs, working in tandem with the US-based
credit rating agencies, Standard & Poors and Moodys and Fitch, exploded the
Greece financial crisis at the precise time China and other major investors
were beginning to have serious doubts about the fiscal stability of the
United States and of the dollar.
Let me be clear. The Euro as it stands, the supranational European Central
Bank and the EU approach to international financial stability is not merely
a flawed construct.
It is inherently programmed to crises. It was
born as the product of flawed rotten political compromises in the 1990s
through the
Treaty of Maastricht as an attempt by
France and Italy and Britain to control an emerging German economic colossus
after German unification.
However, the concerted attack by a group of New York hedge funds such as
George Soros and Paulsons earlier this year and the precisely timed
credit downgrade of Greece to junk status were part of a concerted US
strategy of financial warfare against that Eurozone, the only potential
alternative to the dollar as world reserve currency.
Should the US dollar lose its status as the
world leading reserve currency - today it still counts for some 65% of
central bank currency reserves - the United States would be ultimately
doomed as world sole Superpower.
Now the surprise announcement by China of plans to support Greece and the
Euro give an unexpected boost to the embattled country and to the Euro and
expose the dollar even more to possible sell-off.
Greece desperately needs foreign investment to help it meet terms of a 110
billion bailout from Eurozone members and the international monetary Fund
that saved it this spring from state debt default.
I am convinced that with my visit to Greece
our bilateral relations and cooperation in all spheres will be further
developed, Wen said on his way to Brussels for an EU-China Summit.
Like most things that China does these days, it
is part of a shrewd political calculation.
Greece has agreed to support EU recognition of
full market economy status for China within the EU, while China agrees to
back Greeces call for UN mediation over Cyprus.
The two countries will will cooperate on
development as well of Piraeus Pier, upgrading it to a distributing and
transfer center for Asian exports to Europe, the Mediterranean, and the
Black Sea.
As if specially timed, US hedge fund speculator,
George Soros, who is currently
appealing a French court conviction for insider trading, [1] has
come out publicly blaming the German government of Angela Merkel for
austerity measures he says will lead the Euro Zone into a deflation
spiral, demanding instead more of a US-style fiscal stimulus.
US financial warfare
against Euroland?
Notably, Soros has been one of the strongest voices against the Euro at a
time when the world, at the end of 2009 was losing confidence in not the
Euro but the US dollar.
On February 26, the Wall Street Journal reported
details of a secret New York meeting involving billionaire hedge fund
speculator George Soros of the $27 billion Soros Fund Management, along
with,
-
SAC Capital Advisors LP
-
Greenlight Capital
-
and undisclosed others
According to the Journal report, they agreed on
a concerted attack on the Euro, using the Greek financial crisis as the
lever to make the attack credible.
Earlier this year, speaking at the
Davos World Economic Forum, the same Soros
boosted the potential of the secretly planned collusion against the Euro,
when he told press there was no attractive alternative to the dollar, a
signal for a de facto attack on the Euro which was regarded six months ago
as an alternative to the dollar as world reserve currency.
He added that the Euros problems made it an
unviable substitute reserve currency.
Soros anti-Euro remarks were followed by prominent New York economist
Nouriel Roubini, who said that Europes
fiscal woes were creating a rising risk that its single-currency alliance
will splinter.
Down the line, not this year or two years
from now, we could have a breakup of the monetary union, Both Roubini
and Soros are close to the Obama Administration.
Soros was one of the first financial backers of
Obama
and Roubini is reported very close to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.
Following his hedge fund chat about the future
of the Euro, on February 22,
Soros wrote an OpEd article in Londons
Financial Times, the worlds most prominent financial daily in which he
stated,
The survival of Greece would still leave
the future of the Euro in question."
The attack on Greece and the Euro early this
year also involved the most powerful players on Wall Street, the Gods of
Money as I term them in my new book.
The politically powerful Wall Street bank,
Goldman Sachs, has been in the middle of the Greek financial manipulations
since Greece entered the Euro in 2001. They were also involved in the
January 2010 Greek crisis attack. On January 29, Goldman Sachs went with a
number of top Wall Street firms to Greece where they met the Greek deputy
finance minister and the National Bank of Greece. The Soros hedge fund
attacks began several days after that.
According to the Wall Street Journal report, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America
and Londons Barclays Bank joined Soros and the hedge funds, making bets
against the Euro at the same time Goldman Sachs is acting as an advisor to
the Papandreou government, which would appear to be a rather clear conflict
of interest.
The US-based credit rating agencies, Moodys and Standard & Poors also played
a critical role in weakening the Euro earlier this year.
At the time the EU governments announced
agreement in principle on a Greek bailout package in order to stabilize the
speculative attacks on the Euro, on Appril 27, Standard & Poors announced an
unprecedented rating downgrade of Greek government debt by three-levels to
junk grade.
That move insured that pension funds and other
investors would be forced to panic sell Greek bonds, a move that greatly
exacerbated the pressures on the Euro.
Asia Crisis and
British Pound EMU crisis
The pattern of the hedge fund attacks on the Euro follows the financial
warfare strategy carried out by select US hedge funds previously.
In 1992, on what many market professionals
believe must have been insider information, Soros claimed to have made $1
billion speculating against the British Pound Sterling and forcing the
British government to abandon plans to bring Britain into the emerging
Eurozone. Had Britain and the powerful financial resources of the City of
London come into the new Eurozone, many in Wall Street and Washington
privately feared that could spell the death knell for the dollar as world
reserve currency.
The fact that the dollar is world reserve
currency has been one of two strategic props for American power in the
world, the other being the Pentagon. Were the dollar to lose that, the
future of the American Century, the sole superpower would be mortally in
doubt.
Similarly, in May 1997, it was a concerted hedge fund attack again led by
George Soross
Quantum Fund, joined by
Moore Capital Management and Julian
Robertsons
Tiger Management Group and his Jaguar and
Tiger funds, against the currencies of the Asian Tiger economies that
turned Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia.
The wrecking of the Tiger economies in 1997-1998
turned those economies from self-sustaining dynamic economic growth, largely
financially independent of US or IMF control, into de facto buyers of US
Government debt as Asia tried to defend against future attacks.
Like the Sterling crisis of 1992 the 1997-1998
Asia Crisis also served to give a few more years of life support to the
fragile dollar.
Now, as the US depression deepens and the dimension of the banking problems
worsens by the Day, the dollars future is threatened as never before. To
counter this, clearly the most powerful circles of Wall Street and the
Treasury and Federal Reserve are magnifying the small Greek crisis into an
exaggerated picture of collapse of the EU in hopes of ruining the Euro as
a potential alternative to the dollar for foreign central banks.
This is not to say that the Euro and the
Maastricht Treaty are a model for a healthy alternative to the problems of
the dollar region. Far from it. It is merely to identify the geopolitical
power battle going on behind the scenes to keep the dollar Titanic from
sinking.
China has evidently decided to weigh in on that
battle on the side of the Euro.
