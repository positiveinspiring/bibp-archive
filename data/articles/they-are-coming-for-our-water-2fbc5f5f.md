America
is under attack in so many ways, it is difficult to count.
Along
these lines, there is presently a three pronged globalist plot designed to
subjugate the people of this country.
These three elements include,
-
controlling the nations water supplies by creating massive debt forcing
governments to relinquish control over its water supplies
-
private
individuals and corporations are acquiring and hording massive amounts of
water
-
the Environmental Protection Agency is presently engaged in
activities, on behalf of the UNs Agenda 21 policies, to use the control of
water to also control food production and eliminate private property
ownership
The Path to American Totalitarianism
If a totalitarian government desired to control the people of
the United States, garrisoning the country with an army of occupation would
be extremely difficult, if not impossible.
The United States has 315 million
people which own 300+ million plus handguns and the country occupies a good
portion of a continent. These are daunting challenges to occupying the
United States.
Most military strategists will tell you that it takes about
one soldier for every 50 citizens to effectively garrison a country. This
means that an army which would effectively garrison this country would have
to be over six million strong! Even for the Chinese, this would be a
difficult task.
There are simpler and more efficient ways to control a
country than military occupation.
How to Successfully Occupy the United States
History tells us that to successfully occupy the United
States, one would be better off controlling essential life-sustaining
resources instead of attempting to garrison the country.
What are these
essential resources?
Controlling America by controlling essential
resources.
To control a population such as the United States, one would
have to control what Abraham Maslow called the essential elements
for survival, namely,
How best to control food, water
and shelter than to reduce the diversification of ownership over these
resources and history has produced an effective model to describe how to
effectively control these essential elements of survival.
As the Roman Empire declined in influence and power,
Feudalism replaced the nation-state government. The feudal lord was one of
the few employers in the fourth and the fifth centuries. The feudal lords
owned most of the land and nearly all the resources.
Today, the specter of
feudalism has shape-shifted into a global corporatocracy headed by,
The global
corporations are constructing this brand of neo-feudalism right before our
eyes.
Phase One - Debt Enslavement Leads to Control of Water
Both
history and current events demonstrate that the more debt a country
acquires, the more at risk that country is to losing control over its
infrastructure and in particular, its water supplies to private interests.
What do
countries do when they are being strangled by debt?
The answer is simple,
they simply borrow more money. As Americas aging infrastructure falls
further into disrepair, the various levels of government will be forced to
borrow more money in order to keep its water supplies safe.
This has been
done before and the results were devastating to the country borrowing money.
The World Bank and
Bechtels control of Bolivian
water
led to massive civil disobedience and violence.
Bolivia,
in 2000, is the poster child for what happens to a country when it borrows
money to fix its water issues.
The Bolivian case in point is exemplified by the fact that
the country borrowed money from the predatory World Bank in order to fix its
water issues.
The World Bank brought in Bechtel Corporation to fix Bolivias
water issues, however, Bolivia predictably defaulted on its World Bank loan
obligations and their water supplies went into receivership as
prices skyrocketed by 400%.
Further the Bolivians lost the right to trap
rainwater and reuse irrigation water.
The exact scheme is also underway in Lima, Peru, where the
typical poor family pays private vendors up to $3
per cubic meter to
collect contaminated water in buckets while the elite pay 30 cents per cubic
meter for treated water that pours out of taps in their homes.
Also, in India,
some families spend a quarter of their income on water. Debt manipulation,
for the ultimate purpose of controlling water, is not just in play in the
third world.
Very soon, Americas crushing debt load combined with a quickly
declining water infrastructure will lead officials in the US.
Massive protests were held in Peru
over the
privatization of its water supplies
by the UN and its corporate minions.
The derivative debt has paralyzed the economies of Europe and
the United States. Debt default, followed by the banker bailouts will lead
to private entities controlling our essential resources.
How long will it be until the globalists have to bail out the
American economy while we continue on our trek towards unsustainable
debt?
When Americas economy falters, the bankers, armed with their central
bank printing presses, will come to the rescue. The price for their
intervention, judging by what happened in Bolivia, will be total control
over our infrastructure.
Collecting rainwater and purifying stream water to
drink, have already become illegal acts.
All water will be obtained through
the public private partnership corporations and you can bet, as history has
set the precedent, the price of water will get very expensive.
Illegal to conserve.
What ever happened to
Agenda 21′s conservation movement?
States like,
-
Colorado
-
Utah
-
Washington,
...have already made
it illegal to trap rain water and use these resources for such purposes as
drinking and irrigation.
In
Douglas County, Colorado, just
south of metropolitan Denver, engineers
conducted
a study on
how rainwater collection affects aquifer function and health as well as
groundwater supplies. The study revealed that when private parties collect
rainwater on their properties, this serves to reduce the demand on local
water facilities and improves conservation efforts.
Based upon this
research, trapping rainwater should be encouraged. However, conservation is
not the goal of modern day water management, political and personal control
of the citizenry is the final objective.
The Bolivian water experience is already underway in the
United States.
Did we really think that
this was only going to happen in Bolivia? Similar projects are underway in,
-
Manila
-
Pakistan
-
San Francisco
Yes, this is correct; Bechtel now has a
contract with San Franciscos city government to upgrade the citys water
system.
Bechtel employees are working side by side with city workers in a
privatization move that people-in-the-know fear will lead to an eventual
take-over of San Francisco s water system and create a fiasco similar to
the one in Bolivia.
The wolf is at the door as massive debt will soon cause the US to lose
control over our water.
This is all part of an
Agenda 21 plot to control the
water of the United States in order to subjugate the people and to make a
lot of money in the process.
The Inbred Relationship Among the Government, Bechtel and the
United Nations
How interconnected are the
global corporations to,
Before the cries which will challenge me to don my tin foil hat
before writing about a water conspiracy, I would ask that you please first
consider the following list of Bechtel employees who have moved into major
policy making positions both in the United States Government and the United
Nations.
-
Bechtels CEO, Riley P. Bechtel, served on the President
Bushs (43) Export Council (4/24/03)
-
George Schultz. Shortly after assuming his new position in
Bechtel, President Reagan recruited Schultz to Washington to serve as
Secretary of State.
-
Reagans Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinburger was a former
Bechtel general counsel.
-
W.
K. Davis was a Bechtel vice-president for nuclear development before he was
appointed as Reagans Deputy Secretary of Energy and administrative head of
the Atomic Energy Commission.
-
William Casey a former Bechtel consultant served in a number
of government positions including chairman of the SEC under Nixon, head of
the Export-Import bank under President Ford, and director of the CIA under
Reagan.
-
Richard Helm, who later became a consultant to Bechtel,
had earlier been a CIA director under Nixon.
-
William Simon, Nixons Treasury secretary, was hired
by Bechtel as a consultant.
-
Ross
Connelly, CEO of Bechtel Energy Resources Corporation (retired), was
appointed by George W. Bush (41) in June of 2001 to the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC). The OPIC has strong connections to the
United Nations privatization projects.
-
Stew Burkhammer, a current Bechtel executive, is presently a
member of the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA)
Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health.
-
Marie-Françoise
of Bechtel (France), Conseiller dEtat, From 1979 to 1980, she was
Consultant of the United Nations Asian and Pacific Development Center.
The
connections between these groups can be further exemplified by the
following:
United Resolution 1483, from the UN Security Council in 2003,
approved the occupation of Iraq by American and British forces, thus making
Iraq into a de facto colony.
As such, this opened door for a corporate
feeding frenzy by companies such as Bechtel as they lined up to repair
Iraq following Gulf War II.
Subsequently, Bechtel received a $1.03 billion
contract to oversee major reconstruction of Iraqs water and sewage. In
spite of Bechtels promises, Iraqi families continue to lack access to clean
water. The company made providing Southern Iraqs potable water one of its
top priorities in which Bechtel promised delivery within 60 days following
the commencement of the project.
Within a year, Iraqi people still were
suffering through epidemics of water-borne illnesses (e.g., cholera, kidney
stones and diarrhea).
Bechtel failed to live up to its word, but they did
make a lot of money. And some people think that
the United Nations is merely
a benign and benevolent organization which is essentially neutral on all
areas of politics and finance.
Today, the stock holders of Bechtel have the
United Nations to thank, in large
part, for their good fortune.
Conclusion
Lets be
very clear.
Debt is being used to control water by taking advantage of
various levels of governments which are defaulting on financial obligations.
This practice will soon be visited upon the United States.
The United
Nations, the World Bank and globalist corporations (e.g. Bechtel) are
waiting in the wings to subjugate our people as our crushing debt will
undoubtedly open this door.
America
can indeed be garrisoned through the control of water. And the control of
water will, in large part, be facilitated through the controlling of the
Americas debt.
If this
were the sole extent of our water challenges, our collective existence would
be imperiled, but it gets worse. We now know that when the globalists invade
a country, they do so on multiple fronts.
In the
next part of this series, two more aspects of water control (see
The EPA Legally Controls All Water, Food Production
and Private Property) will be revealed
as it becoming clear that the globalists, through the Environmental
Protection Agency, are not just going to control water, but they are going
to use the control of water to also control food production and private
property ownership.
