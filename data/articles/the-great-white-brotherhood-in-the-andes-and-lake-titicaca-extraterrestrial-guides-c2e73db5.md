MS: Were ready to launch into the
presentation for this afternoon. This next presentation is about
something that I hold very dear in my research on extraterrestrial life,
which concerns the experiences of those that have had direct,
face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrial beings.
These people have
a story to tell which is so profoundly transformative and, according to
my research, is so disturbing to vested governmental and security
interests that they have tried very hard, for over 60 years, to suppress
this kind of information.
So, its such a thrill to be able to hear from
someone who comes forward and speaks with great authority from their own
personal experience someone whose voice hasnt been muted, someone who
has the dignity and the integrity to carry on despite whatever
opposition he finds.
This person comes from Bolivia. He has had contact with
extraterrestrials from the planets Venus, and Ganymede, which is one of
the moons of Jupiter. And he has also had contact with the Inner Earth
Beings the Elders, who are those associated with the Great White
Brotherhood.
Luis Fernando Mostajo has been having physical contact
experiences since birth. In 1977, when he was 13, he began to speak
about these experiences, and he continues to do so to this day.
For over
30 years now hes been speaking with great authority about his
experiences. And for decades hes been holding Contact Preparation
Courses in the countries of South America Argentina, Chile, Peru,
Paraguay, El Salvador, and Central America in Honduras, Costa Rica, in
Mexico, in the US, and, of course, Bolivia. Hes published five books
wherein he shares these experiences that he has had with
extraterrestrials. I believe he has a few of the books at the back, so
you can have a look at those
. Theres one translated into English. Its
definitely something worth having a look at.
He has demonstrated, to
detached observers, that his experiences are very real. Hes had people
come from the TASS Agency to watch programmed UFO sightings. This is
something that he has been able to succeed in manifesting, according to
the communications he has had. So, I wont take up any more of your
time, Luis. I welcome you.
Luis will be translated by Manuel Roberto,
who is also going to be our performer tonight. Manuel is multi-talented,
multi-tasking like many of our great volunteers here. So with that,
welcome, Luis and Manuel.
Audience applaud.
LF: Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you, Angelika and Michael, for
allowing me the opportunity to be able to be here with all of you, to
tell you about my experiences of over 30 years of contact not only with ETs, but also with the teachers of internal meditation. My experiences
started in 1975, with telepathic communications. Through these
communications they asked me to get out of the city.
These are beings
who come from our solar system, from the second planet of our system. We
call that planet Venus
The Morning Light. They claim, in their
communications, that, not only now but for many, many thousands of
years, they are forming a Great Plan of assisting and helping this
planet. These beings that come from Venus are here their influence is
felt, especially here in North America, Central America, and South
America. Especially during the first or original cultures of the
Americas.
They manifested themselves telepathically.
They are here now trying to establish a bridge of communication with,
because, for them, its part of a program of assistance. It is a mission
of contact because the evolved worlds that are in this galaxy, who form
the
Confederation of Planets, have seen, at this time, not only the
changes of this Earth, but also of the whole galaxy. They claim that
this planet as we know it is not finished evolving. It is still
transforming itself. Within this transformation, it is up to us to take
a part, a role, in this planet regarding these changes that are
happening.
They claim, firstly, that the whole universe is pure energy,
and, secondly, that this energy is dynamically acting upon all stars in
the galaxy, which are continually transferring information. The
universe, as we see it at night, is constituting itself into the
universal consciousness. Our sun is
receiving this cosmic energy and it
is sending back to our planet, determining the conditions of life and
living for humanity.
For thousands of years this cosmic energy was concentrated in
the
mythical mountains of Tibet. But, after the Second World War, this
energy, which is part of the cosmic energy of the planet and it had a
masculine-positive form was transferred to the Americas. In its
feminine aspect, or negative charge
. Negative doesnt mean bad, but a
quality that is represented.
The feminine energy is concentrated in the
Americas, all along the Andes and going all the way up to Mt Shasta.
This energy has its center in Lake Titicaca because its the highest
place, at 3800 meters above sea level, forming a great place for
concentrating the energy.
Later on we are going to see more about that.
But I will to tell you this; the Great White Brotherhood has deposited
there a wonderful instrument known as the Sun.
Now, the ET guides invited me, along with six other friends, to go to a
place called the Animas at nine oclock at night. They said they were
going to come with their ships, confirming the telepathic communication
that I had back in 1977. So, that date I went with my friends to this
place, and what I saw changed my life. Five different objects appeared
in front of my eyes.
They started to send beams of light, as if they had
powerful flashlights, that were illuminating great extensions of land,
for about fifteen minutes.
While that was happening, I received more
telepathic communications from the ET guides who were claiming to start
a new process of preparation, for us to be able to have physical contact
with them and not because they are better than we are, but because the
fields of energy in which they move around are different than our fields
of energy.
They suggested that we need to start a different civilization
for our physical structure, our thoughts, and to elevate our spiritual
vibrations. They also suggested that we start a process of vegetarianism
in order to elevate our vibration. Then they can come down and contact
can be made.
They claim that around Lake Titicaca area they have supported the
civilizations of two great solar cultures. One civilization is that of
Tiahuanaco which, even today, very few people know about it, that is
considered the most ancient in South America.
But recently, excavation
began and now it is about 10 percent excavated so far. I was telling
them about the concentration of cosmic energy in this planet the
positive energy and the negative energy that it is specifically
concentrated in Tibet, in
Lake Manasarovar; and also in Lake Titicaca,
in South America.
It is curious to see these two photographs [Indicating the video image
on right]. But down there, there are Tibetan people.
So if there werent
these Tibetan people here, then we could say that it looks to be the
same place. The mountains of the Himalayas are very similar to those of
the Andes.
Within this area in Lake Titicaca, and part of the Andes, there is a
triangle of energy where the extraterrestrial guides were assisting the
development of the original South American cultures until the Golden Age
of Tiahuanaco.
It is known today as the Solar Civilization.
The
Tiahuanaco civilization has been debased by the many theories that have
been evolved.
Some theories sustain that the Tiahuanacans began and
developed the Golden City of America the famous Paititi. In the Amazon
section of Bolivia we have found archeological ruins which today dont
have any explanation because they are very different.
These ancient people had a very advanced technology by which to control
the weather for farming and irrigation. There were very, very large
pools that were created, located farther away, but they were built in
order to feed many people, through the preparation of the land. They
were able to feed millions of people, not just thousands.
Regarding the
Tiahuanaco civilization, there are many speculations over the origin of
the famous Paititi. In the last few years, Gene Allen the famous British
archeologist
Have you ever listened to this gentleman on the Discovery channel,
British archeologist Gene Allen, who did a documentary about Atlantis in
the Andes
. The satellite photographs have shown that there is a city
underneath everything. With regard to all of these buildings, there are
pools and canals of high technology that are very ancient, dating back
thousands and thousands of years.
Recently some archeologists have
found, around the archeological ruins of Tiahuanaco, writing, dating
from the pre-Sumerian period. This is obligating us to rewrite history.
With regard to Dr
Michael Cremos lecture yesterday, he spoke about the
archeological findings of some footprints, dating back millions of years
ago. Recently, the Institute of Bolivian Archeology found a petrified
footprint which, according to the carbon-14 analysis, was made during
the Tertiary Age, about 15 million years ago.
This footprint corresponds
to a normal homo-sapien of about 512 and about 80lbs. It is important
to know about these things because, certainly, something happened in the
past indicating that there have been other civilizations much more
developed than ours. But, they disappeared. They claim that the
disappearance of previous civilizations was not only due to natural
catastrophes, but also because of man himself.
That reason for the disappearance is the message that we need to take
into account. It is what the ET guides are telling us about.
They have
been reminding us that we, too, are living our last opportunity toward
evolving ourselves as a civilization.
What we need to do now is discover
precisely what happened in the past, learn the lesson from it, and plan
for our future by understanding the past with regard to our present.
What you are looking at [image on left] is the remnant of what was the
way of life in
Atlantis, and the
guides from Venus.
An astrologist has studied the Door Of The Sun, and he has determined
that what is depicted, here [on the image], represents Venus.
Venus has
292 days of rotation around the sun, and from that depiction on this
Door Of The Sun, it is now known as the Calendar Of Venus.
It has been mentioned that not only the
Tiahuanaco civilization was
influenced on our planet by these off planet civilizations
In the
original cultures of North America, we know that the Apaches to this day
are direct descendants of these guides.
The information that they have
is starting to be discovered, and it is also now being understood at
this time.
At this point, the ET guides have been contacting me and they
are manifesting themselves to me.
They have continuously invited me to
different places where they manifest themselves, such as in the Andes,
as well as in the Amazon. It is through these experiences of a contact
program that I have become familiar with their presence.
Now, they claim that the greatest barrier for the human being is fear of
the unknown. Consequently, they claim that what we must learn is to
control our fears, our emotions, so that our contact with them can be
possible. So, they invited me to many inhospitable places, sometimes by
myself, sometimes with a group, so that I could conquer my own fears and
emotions something very, very difficult to do.
I remember thinking, If the guides are observing me, nothing wrong can
happen.
But then when you start walking around in the middle of the
night, and youre 3 meters down the road, and suddenly you start feeling
like someone is touching your back, thats when you get chicken-skin.
Later, I realized that when you have this kind of experience a lot of
emotions start coming up from inside you. So not only do you need to
recognize them as they come up, you also need to overcome them.
This is
what constitutes the preparation of self-control. But in my case, this
emotional preparation lasted more than a year. It lasted for 3 years.
During this preparation process the guides gave me tools. They imparted
to me a name which is known as the cosmic name. They claim that all the
living beings in the universe have a unique key which is not duplicated
to anyone else. It is your own unique cosmic name.
When you start working with your own key, a lot of memories start waking
up from within your sub-consciousness. You start remembering who you
are. You remember who you are and where you come from. You remember what
is your present mission, and where you need to go in the future
During
my experience when I was with the extraterrestrial guides, they asked me
to extend my hands. When I did so, a ship started coming down. It was
above me.
It started sending me this energy which came down into my
hands, in a physical form, like two pyramids. It was integrated inside
of my body, a few centimeters above the thymus where there is the
terminal of our radial nerves, and which allows the body to assimilate
the energy.
They explained to me that this experience and this tool is
not only given to all the spiritual beings that are working for this
change, but is also given to the planet for its transformation.
Since biblical times they have been giving these tools to other beings.
If you remember in Genesis, when the people of Israel were leaving
Egypt, the priests, in order to offer the host, did the ceremonies. They
would put the two stones, known as the Urim and Thumim.
Here in North
America, the last record of this experience was with
Joseph Smith (the Mormons), who
also received two white stones in order to translate the golden plates.
What the extraterrestrial guides are doing now, though, is giving us new
tools that enable us to awaken our sixth sense the sense of
clairvoyance so that we can see beyond our physical eyes, to see with
our spiritual eye the life that exists in the next dimension.
So, after
three years, I became familiar with all of their ships. What I am
telling you was witnessed by myself and by the group of people, my
friends, who were with me.
Now, a ship
was in charge of opening a dimensional field known by them
as the Door Of The Sender. These doors are a concentration of luminous
energy that allows us to introduce ourselves to them by accelerating our
vibration which dematerializes the molecules of the body so we can
project ourselves to the place where they are waiting for us. This is
not science fiction. Even today our own science is developing a machine
of teleportation. It transports one particle here to another location
there.
This brings to mind the
Philadelphia Project in the United
States. Through this program experience, the ET guides from Venus were
wondering if I would be able to speak the truth of what they were
telling me.
They are aware that the human being, since birth, learns by imitation.
So, when we come into contact with a different civilization which is
much more evolved than ours one that has gone beyond war, illness,
famine, lack then we can come to understand this higher concept of
life, and we can share it with other people in the very places where we
live.
We can help people who will then help other people to understand
this higher concept of life. They claim that some people believe that a
great ship is going to come down out of the sky and magically change
everything for us. No. It is the human being who must assume that
responsibility of change.
Right now is the time that we need to take
full charge of our destiny.
After three years of preparation, I was in the middle of the Andes. They
told me that at eight oclock at night a ship was going to come to a
valley called "Valle Potosi".
This ship was going to monitor the
materialization of the door through which I would be able to get in
touch with them, and through which I would arrive at a city not located
on this planet, Earth, but on Venus in a valley known to them as
the
Valley Of Silence. This is a place where there are concentrated the
academy of the spiritual science of this civilization.
While I was in the Andes, when the ship was coming toward me, I wanted
to leave but my curiosity keep me on.
An object similar to that one [on right] was between two hills. The ship
was producing pulsations that were concentrating its energy like a half
moon. It was a whitish color, and shining. Once the energy was
materialized, they told me, Come. Immediately my heart started
jumping.
Come, they said again.
I started walking toward the energy coming from the ship. I began to go
through the energy field and immediately I did not feel any weight.
I
had a sensation of vertigo, like when you are flying on an airplane,
going through a turbulence, and theres a lot of pressure in the head
and chest.
I wanted to leave, but I couldnt because I was engulfed by
the energy field that was pulling me forward, yet my feet were not
touching the ground.
Immediately the starry night of the Andes began to transform itself into
a magical valley. The sky had multi-colored forms.
Immediately to my
right, a being, with beautiful characteristics, said,
Dont worry. You
are here because the time has arrived for you to corroborate everything
that I have told you before. My name is Etel. During your time with us
here were going to tell you about part of your mission, and the purpose
of my presence with you.
Then he started to speak about what he was
observing in the sky.
It was the reaction of the clouds that surround
Venus. It is known as the solar rain. That is what was producing the
multi-colored sky. On this planet, Earth, there is something similar to
that the Aurora Borealis. He said that their life on Venus is
subterranean. When a civilization is more evolved they dont build above
ground but mainly subterranean. And there is an explanation for that.
They believe that the ancient civilizations were trying to be as close
as possible to the nucleus of the planet, to the telluric energy. That
reminded me of the ancient civilizations who used to build their temples
on top of a hill, or below the Earth, in order to connect the cosmic
energy with the telluric energy.
They said that they didnt utilize
angles, but circular and conic constructions. That reminded me of the
teepees of native North Americans. They said that in their current
civilization, they have less than five million people, and that they are
mainly feminine. That reminded me of the Greek mythology of the muses.
The civilization from Venus is very similar to ours, but we would say
ours is very similar to theirs. And there is a simple reason for that.
There has been a hybrid interaction. They claim that they have had a
different genetic insertion than our human insertion. The famous missing
link would be the extraterrestrial genetics which those people inserted,
four or five thousand years ago cybernetic energy and other special
energies.
According to anthropological studies, in order to go from one
state of evolution to another it takes hundreds of thousands of years,
and in some cases even millions of years.
So then, the question is,
What
happened in such a short span of time in human evolution that got us
from the cave to taking trips to outer space?
This new genetic insertion
evolved our own species. In a very short amount of time we jumped
another step.
Now, the people on Venus feed themselves the same way that we do, except
that they eat only a vegetable and mineral diet. Their physical
development is assisted by methods that determine the quantities of
minerals and calories that one needs. Their bodies have done away with
many of the organs that we still have.
We still have them because we eat
more than what we should. In order to maintain their species, they still
have physical contact for procreation. But their union is more
pleasurable because of their spiritual experience.
They said that in
order for us to wake up and keep advancing as a species we need to
continue getting closer to ourselves and helping one another. There is
an evolution chain in the universe. Some of them have reached a very
high level of development socially.
They are able to share that freely
to people like ourselves.
Something that really touched me was how Etel looks. He is a being of
about 5 12. They have clear eyes. Their skin is whitish. Their ears
are bigger than ours. Their attire was fitted close to the skin. Etel
said that in order to find true spirituality, going to the top of the
mountain to sit and meditate for hours is not required.
To find true
spirituality you only need to understand the laws of nature and how to
live in harmony with nature. True spirituality is not far away. It is
very close to us.
Ones true transformation comes from that which allows
us to change our attitude, to think positively, to feel positive, so
that we then act positively.
He took me to the presence of three elders the wise people of Venus.
They spoke lovingly to me through the universal language, which is not
only telepathic, but is a series of ideograms, which is what they call
a
record [represented in image on left].
We know it as the Akashic
Record. This is something that is in the Van Allen Radiation Belt around
the Earth.
It is continuously recording every thought of every one of
us. In its physical form, there are seven shapes. Thats what the elders
said.
Earths Akashic Records are protected by an internal government of the
Earth. This internal government of the Earth is known as the Great White
Brotherhood. And this Great White Brotherhood was formed at the end of
the destruction of the ancient Atlantis civilization.
Before the
disappearance of their civilization, the elders of
Atlantis protected
their knowledge by placing it in trusted guardianships at the various
colonies that they established in different locations inside the planet.
It is at these places where the positive government of the Earth is
residing.
They are waiting lovingly for humanity to mature so that they
can give us this knowledge and then the new humanity can be guided, like
a road map, so that we dont make the same mistakes again. That is how
it was conveyed to me.
So, near to where I used to live at Lake
Titicaca, in another small lake known as Lago Winaymarka in the
Aymara
language, there is one of these internal places. Part of my mission is
to stay in touch with them because they are human beings, teachers who,
for thousands of years, have understood the purpose of the Earth and of
the creation of the cosmos.
Either way, since an image is worth more than a thousand words, I have
made this recreation for you.
This is close to what I saw and
experienced with the guides of Venus [video simulation begins].
This is a way to concentrate the solar energy.
This is how the
inhabitants of Venus receive the solar energy and then send it out to
other places [above image]. There is vegetation in this valley, but
they live subterraneously (underground).
But it is not like being in a dark cave.
Within the cave itself it looks like a real sky is above you. They said
that when human beings reach this kind of understanding then they will
take the reigns in their own hands and will change the future
positively, not only for themselves but more importantly for everyone
else as well.
The elders said that human beings go through four different stages.
-
The
first stage is omnipotence. In the first 2 years of life you always get
the highest attention.
-
The second stage is dependence. We dont do
anything without consulting with our family members.
-
The third stage is
the age of rebellion. This is when human beings, in its adolescence
period, start to cut all the emotional ties so as to identify themselves
as individuals.
-
Then we reach the fourth stage.
There are very, very few
that evolve in their lives to the fourth stage.
The problems of the
third stage of dependence are reflected in peoples daily lives. There
are many people who get married so that they can have a husband or wife
to depend on.
There are people who require a political or a spiritual
organization in order to follow a leader who tells them what to do.
The mature stage, the fourth stage, is where you have come to know what
your own role in life is so that you dont have to depend on a second or
third person to tell you what you can or cant do, what it is that
youre supposed to do with your life. When you arrive at that stage,
when you know what you are to do and how to do it, that is what is known
as the Awakening of the Consciousness. It is when you take into your own
hands the reigns of your own destiny.
That is when you start changing
the future positively, not only for yourself but also for the wellbeing
of others.
When you are the only one around who reaches that awakening, if there is
no group of others, the elders said it is possible to start talking of
changing at the personal level. Then you can start forming a system,
like a pyramid, which we have been under for thousands of years. It is a
horizontal system where you are recognizing what you have to share with
others.
But in order to become realized, it is more important to know
what is lacking by finding in others the necessary substance for our own
realization, then forming a common unity, in thought, in feeling, and in
action. And thats why we at this conference, trying to reach out to
others, with feelings, with thoughts, and with actions, so we can
vibrate like one, regardless of where each one of us is independently
located.
When I came back from my contact with the guides, I became aware of what
they had told me that
near Lake Titicaca there is a retreat of the
White Brotherhood.
The first thing that came to my hands was a map [above]. This map was
achieved with all the archeological findings around the Andes.
The archeologists have determined that there is a big net forming a
square cross. This square cross, in the Aymara language, is known as a Chakana.
It is going to show us that the people of this area have perfect
knowledge of the geomagnetic movement of the Earth because their
buildings were not haphazardly placed, but in special natural magnetic
locations. The center of it is Tiahuanaco and the small lake.
So that you understand better what we are observing here [image below], I started to investigate the symbolism of Andean cosmology. This
is nothing new for the South Americans. This is a natural symbol in the
original cultures. This is the Wiphala. This represents a composition of
light through a prism, or
The Seven Rays.
All the population inherits knowledge of the organization of the
civilization from Venus and the civilization of the Confederation.
According to them, the world is divided by four regions.... When the
four regions unite as one, they form what is called the Chakana.
The Chakana is the square cross.
This Chakana is the map of the pyramids that are all over Central and
South America.
In their pure essence, the unity of the Four Regions
symbolizes the mathematical representation of the geomagnetic movement
of the Earth. Current archeologists know that there is a large temple in
Lake Titicaca. They have started sub-aquatic archeology.
They have
discovered ruins underneath Lake Titicaca which is projected to be from
thousands of years ago.
There was life all around this area.
Lake Titicaca is divided into two sections (below image). What you are seeing here is
the main lake. This is the small lake, or, in Aymara, is Winaymarka.
Winaymarka, in the Aymara language means, The Eternal City.
It is
amazing that geologists cannot explain why, at this point, there are two
longitudinal cross sections, as if a great shovel has taken away a great
portion of the Earth, creating this inundation on that side of the lake.
Furthermore, thats the evidence why all of this was realized.
One year after my contact and my interdimensional trip with the guides
from Venus, contact happened to me again, but this time it was not in
the countryside, but occurred in my own home.
When I was about to go to
sleep, one of the elders came to me in a holographic image. The first
thing that I saw was the same as with the extraterrestrial guides he
had a light coming out of his eyes. He told me how the eyes are the
mirror of the soul. Just then I realized that he was an elder, but with
Nordic characteristics, from the north. He had a beard that was very
fine. He had long, straight, white hair.
While I was observing his presence he told me,
I am Soromis. I love
you, my son. The time has come to give you the key that will open the
door of your consciousness.
When I heard that, I said,
Wow! Finally!
Immediately the elder said,
The key that can open the door of your
consciousness is to love God above everything else, and to love everyone
else as you love yourself.
That created a feeling like an earthquake
within me. It was not a magnetic key. It was not an explanation of magnetics, or vibrations. Nothing strange that I didnt already know.
The elder told me,
True realization is not very far from you. It is
very close to everyone if you are going towards your own light.
At that moment I understood. You can understand this with your mind, but
you can feel it with your heart. The elders are talking to your heart,
not your mind. Their energy, their words and their thoughts have a
certain level of understanding beyond what you are listening to.
They
are illuminating your understanding. I understood at this moment that if
God is love then the only way to connect with that source of love is
through action. And what is the action of love? It is to love. The
action of love is translated in our lives through the action of service.
There is no advancement without service. The only way you can go forward
is in understanding that we cannot give to others what we havent been
able to find inside ourselves. Thats why the first job is one within
yourself. But when you have found your own destiny, in the same way that
the guides and the elders are sharing with us, then we have to share it
with others in order to keep going forward.
I understood that to love
ourselves doesnt mean to look at the mirror and say,
Wow, how
beautiful I am! Now I can go and meet others.
To love oneself is the need to feed oneself at every plane of your
development in the physical plane, the mental plane, and the spiritual
plane. In sum, we become an integral being. I understood that true love
is not what has been taught to us. It is not blind.
True love is
conscious and intelligent because it allows us to give what everyone
requires.
The elder was there not only to let me know of this, but also
to invite me to integrate myself with the luminous circle of Lake
Titicaca. Extending the invitation to me so that I could assist, and so
that I would be able to understand this tool, which is known by them as
the Solar Disk.
This experience was beyond the previous one Id had, going beyond the
Earth.
I was able to know and integrate myself with these elders who are
very, very old. They are the guardians of human history.
Today they have
opened the doors so that this wisdom and knowledge can reach humanity,
until 2012.
Thats what I experienced during my travels to the internal
retreat of Lake Titicaca.
These are the islands of the small lake. This
is one of the passages to the internal retreat.
This is the actual Paititi, the lost city,
The Eternal City, which is beneath the lake, and
is also very similar to what I have experienced on Venus.
The elders are protecting the sun, which is known as the Solar Disk.
What you are observing [image on left] is a tool which allows us to move
through the forces of nature, and also through the most powerful force
which is our own heart.
This is an activating force of our own sun, of
our own atomic structure.
The internal retreat is made of several small buildings. They are
preserving an old civilization
It is the Eternal City that was
protected and is still waiting for us to share this information that has
been kept for millennia.
This photo [at right] is what one of the members of our group took as
the image was materializing itself. It materialized automatically. It
was the Master Solomis. You can see his face eyes, nose, lips, beard.
There is a veil that covers him. Are you seeing that? Thats
Master Solomis. All through these experiences, the extraterrestrial guides, and
Master Solomis, have been continuously accompanying us.
The guides of the Confederation said that the year 2005 was initiated to
be seven definitive years in the historic process of humanity.
They said
that during these seven years we are going to start living the ultimate
preparation.
Why ultimate?
Because whatever we are going to live
during this time has not been written, has not been lived. It has been
prepared so that we can share the roots of the beginning of a new time
and a new world.
In the year 2005, NASA took these photos [below]. You can see all this
magnetic energy which is concentrated around this small lake and forming
the Chakana.
This has about 10 kilometers on each side, exactly the
[size of the] internal retreat underneath Lake Titicaca.
What is happening at this time in the Andes and in Bolivia itself, you
probably have seen it in the news, that in the past five or six years
there have been five presidents.
Whoo! Pull your hairs out!
But it has
an explanation. Studies at NASA have determined that the concentration
of zero gravity is what creates altered states. The society that is
around this field is unstable. The people who are in search for
spiritual knowledge or change take a big step in the process of
awakening. The concentration of energy here which was activated during
the 1950s offers a great opportunity to reach that transformation.
In 2012 there is going to be a council or meeting around this marvelous
energy and the elders.
What we are waiting for, with this process of
preparation, what we are expecting, is that in the years before 2012,
all of us together can come together, can live together, by preparing
ourselves internally which has everything to do with the conscious
management of our internal energies which will bring about the reality
of contact between the elders and us.
This is a different film [still shot below]. This is one of the
guides. In this case there were other people around me who were
observing it too. So, this film has been analyzed and has been on the
news. Thats on the Bolivian television.
In the last few months and
years, the presence of the ships and of the extraterrestrial guides have
been ongoing.
Thats another sighting from a few months ago [still shot on right].
It
was being filmed from an airplane. They filmed it on radar. The object
accompanied the airplane flight. For about 10 minutes it was suspended,
immobile. There are white and blue lights.
After remaining stationary in
the sky for about 10 minutes, it starts moving above the city.
This is one of the photos [on left] that I like best because you can see
the ship coming out.
The energy that I saw in the first part of my trip,
was exactly like that.
This is like a
dimensional door which is opening
up at the same time that the ship is coming out
This is not my only experience to the internal lake.
A couple of years
ago I had another experience, which is not part of [the topic of] this
conference, but I am telling you this because in that experience, while
I was in the Andes at 4,000 meters elevation, I was in contact with a
group of elders, who told me many things concerning this time.
I feel
inside myself that it goes along with this process [Earth
Transformation] that you are living in Hawaii.
Hawaii is the central point of Ring of Fire.
As part of my work about
six years ago, the elders told me to go to the active volcanoes of Costa
Rica. When I went to Costa Rica I suddenly felt that I needed to go to
Hawaii. My trip [here, with you] is a confirmation that the Plan is
moving beyond my own will. The Ring of Fire synchronizes perfectly with
the sun.
The sun projects the program of life through the Ring of Fire.
This Telluric energy is what moves humanity. It is what we feel at this
moment. It is what we are receiving and perceiving, consciously or
unconsciously.
During this trip [to the U.S.] the elders told me to start two councils.
The first one was already done last year with people who came from
seventeen different countries, who had been contacted at Lake Titicaca,
in order to finalize whatever is missing for the advent of the new
world, the new time; and also to initiate, at the world level, the true
preparation of internal life.
You are all welcome, so that together,
united, we can take the next step with everything, until
2012.
Through our communications we have participated in the discovery of
archeological ruins. My experience of contact was one of the few
experiences that has physical evidence of the authenticity of this
communication of the invitation given to six journalists, amongst whom
were two journalists from the Russian TASS [News Agency].
All of these contacts, if you look at the dates [showing video clips],
the contacts have been ongoing after thirty years up through today.
What you are seeing here [above] is the door of a temple for the
activation of solar energy. The elders have given me the command next to
the shores of Lake Titicaca.
This photo is from last year
They [the ET ships] have been with me
constantly
.
Since last year we started to live in the activation of the solar
energy. We are living the ultimate preparation, sharing the internal
energies started by the elders, so that in the near future we can come
back to the fountain where we all come from.
Hopefully we can all come
back to this so that all together we can say, Mission Accomplished.
