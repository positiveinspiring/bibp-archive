Web pioneers united to
stop "interactive Web" patents
at an East Texas trial.
The Eolas patents were uniquely threatening
to the Web and drew Tim Berners-Lee's
personal attention.
The inventor of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, had
never testified in court before last year.
In February 2012, he left
Cambridge to fly down to Tyler, an East Texas city of about 100,000, to
testify at a patent trial. It was the culmination of a bold campaign by
a man named Michael Doyle to levy a vast patent tax on the modern
Web.
Berners-Lee was one of several Web pioneers who
came through the court during the course of a four-day trial, which
ultimately convinced a jury to invalidate two patents owned by
Eolas, the
tiny patent-holding company that Doyle and his lawyers transformed into one
of the most fearsome "patent trolls" of all time.
Now Eolas appears to be gone for good. The
company mounted a lengthy appeal, but it was all for naught; this morning, a
three-judge appeals panel
affirmed the jury's verdict without comment.
In 1993, Doyle was the director of a computer
lab at the University of California-San Francisco.
He oversaw the creation
of a program that allowed doctors to view embryos online, and later claimed
it was the first "interactive" use of the World Wide Web. University lawyers
helped Doyle patent the creation in 1994.
Doyle took the patent and created a company he
called "Eolas," the Irish word for knowledge.
Eolas never made a marketable
product, but it ultimately launched a patent war that made Doyle a rich man.
In 1999, he filed a lawsuit saying that Microsoft's Internet Explorer
violated his patent on "interactive" features on the Web; the suit resulted
in a $540 million jury verdict.
Appeals ensued but were inconclusive; the
case
ultimately settled out for more than $100 million, with just over $30
million going to Eolas' co-plaintiff, the University of California.
Meanwhile, Eolas' original
patent was getting serious attention.
It was actually denounced by
the web's global standard-setting body in 2003. That resulted in an unusual
director-ordered reexamination at the US Patent Office, but Eolas somehow
emerged unscathed.
Eolas got a second patent similar to its first
in 2009. By then, the business of "patent trolling" had matured and become
fantastically lucrative.
The company relocated to East Texas before
filing suit against 20 big companies, including,
-
Apple
-
Perot Systems
-
Blockbuster
-
eBay
-
Adobe
-
Google
-
Yahoo
-
Amazon
Court documents show
the company was seeking more than $600 million in January 2012, a damage
demand that likely had inflated to more than $1 billion by the time of
trial.
The ensuing patent campaign earned Doyle, and
his lawyers, tens of millions of dollars.
Doyle lives in Chicago, where has
given interviews to local media about his
philanthropic efforts, but he has steadfastly refused to discuss his
inventions or the ensuing lawsuits, except when compelled to do so during
litigation.
By the end of the 2012 jury trial, only Google, Yahoo and JC
Penney had not struck deals with Eolas.
Appeal loss shuts down three
other lawsuits
Under Doyle's conception of his own invention,
practically any modern website owed him royalties. Playing a video online or
rotating an image on a shopping website were "interactive" features that
infringed his patents.
And unlike many "patent trolls" who simply
settle for settlements just under the cost of litigation, Doyle's company
had the chops, the lawyers, and the early filing date needed to extract tens
of millions of dollars from the accused companies.
Eolas had kept filing lawsuits even after
its trial loss, with cases against Disney,
ESPN, ABC, Facebook, and Wal-Mart on hold
awaiting the outcome of this appeal; those are all but doomed. Those
lawsuits had asserted the two invalidated patents as well as two new ones,
but the two
newer patents both
incorporate Eolas' first patent.
The patent-holding company's lawyers stayed
those new cases voluntarily, acknowledging that the appeal would have a
"material effect" on their case.
The role of the
University of California is one of the most perplexing twists in the Eolas
saga. The university kept a low profile during the lead-up to trial; but
once in Texas, Eolas' lawyers constantly reminded the jury they were
asserting "these University of California patents."
A lawyer from UC's
patent-licensing division described support for Eolas at trial by simply
saying that the university "stands by its licensees." (Eolas was technically
an exclusive licensee of the UC-owned patent, which also gives it the right
to sue.)
At the same time, the University of California,
and the Berkeley campus in particular, was a key institution in creating
early Web technology. While UC lawyers cooperated with the plaintiffs, two
UC Berkeley-trained computer scientists were key witnesses in the effort to
demolish the Eolas patents.
Pei-Yuan Wei
created the pioneering Viola browser, a key piece of prior art, while he was
a student at UC-Berkeley in the early 1990s. Scott Silvey, another UC-Berkeley
student at that time, testified about a program he made called VPlot, which
allowed users to rotate an image of an airplane using Wei's browser.
VPlot
and Viola were demonstrated to Sun Microsystems in May 1993, months before
Doyle claimed to have conceived of his invention.
