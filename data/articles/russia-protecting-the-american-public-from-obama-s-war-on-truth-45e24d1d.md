-
Who would have thought that the
American people would be beholden to Russia for protecting our
right to know if our government is spying on us?
-
In granting Edward Snowden temporary
asylum, has Russia rebelled against Americas crackdown on
truth?
-
Has Russia broken free from the
Empire?
-
What will Barack Obama and Eric
Holder do to bring Russia back in line?

Mr. Snowden's temporary
refugee status document.
Approximately two days after Bradley
Manning was found guilty on 17 counts amounting to telling the truth
without aiding the enemy, Russia has granted temporary asylum to
Edward Snowden and he is free to travel about the country that has
become the latest champion of American freedom.

Though Bradley Manning was not convicted of
the capital offense of aiding the enemy he faces a possible 130 years
for aiding us, the People of the United States.
Is Russia now providing better American
leadership than
the Obama Administration?
Freedom is lost gradually from an uninterested,
uninformed, and uninvolved people.
Thomas Jefferson
When the people fear their government, there is
tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
Thomas Jefferson
They that can give up essential liberty to obtain
a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.
Benjamin Franklin
In the 1930's and 1940s, starting with the
press, the Government of Nazi Germany suppressed opposition, sending
millions of potential dissenters to special courts and later to
concentration camps, where the innocent were experimented upon, tortured
and murdered.
In 1914, in
Ludlow Colorado (the United States), the National Guard troops
cooked wives and children of miners who had refused to work due to bad
conditions. In the Spanish Inquisition, the death toll figures from the
torture ranged from ten thousand to more than more than a hundred
thousand.
How do governments do this? They do this by
keeping the public in the dark. Where was the free press?
The United States has gone into war after
war based on lies in the press.
The press has continually stood down
and let millions die to make nicey-nice with the real evil wrongdoers.
Examples of wars that we entered because of
false information in the press and lack of correct insider information
were:
The
Spanish-American War , World War I, World War II, Vietnam,
Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya and other wars.
Millions died because of the failure of the
free press in the United States.
One thing of which the founders of the
United States were certain was that governments were, by their very
nature - evil. The Constitutional Convention was convened on May 25,
1987, behind closed curtains and without Thomas Jefferson.
Though the document was a good one, it never
would have been approved without a promise of a Bill of Rights.
This is because the people had already seen despotic control from above
turn evil.
This Bill of Rights, in its First
Amendment, included Freedom of the Press and Freedom of Speech.
This is because, the one thing that had
allowed the colonists to organize and to know what was going on was an
independent press that kept them informed about the atrocities of the
British Government. The rights not given to the government were retained
by the people under the Tenth Amendment.
When did we repeal the Bill of Rights?
If you dont use something, you lose it.
While the mainstream press has sold out the American people and the
Constitution of the United States repeatedly, independent media has
jumped in to tell the truth.
The lead has been taken by individuals like,
...and others who have worked to bring out
information that needs to be published.
The mainstream media has fallen an average
of about two years behind the independent media in coverage of major
stories. If you want to find what will be big news two years from now,
stop watching Fox and MSNBC, ignore the L.A. Times and New York Times,
and start searching independent sources for real news.
In 2002, did you know one of our leaders
(not necessarily Scooter Libby) committed treason by outing CIA
operative Valerie Plame?
In that same year, did you know that it was
provable that there were NO weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Those
who looked beyond the corporate pro-war news did.
At the California Democratic Executive Board
Meeting of July 20, 2013, Truthdig Editor Robert Scheer pointed
out that
90%
of journalist coverage comes from leaks. If leakers are afraid to
reveal the truth, we instantly lose 90% of the most important news we
need to know.
So when those who would let us know the
truth get life imprisonment, not for doing anything that helps an enemy
of this country, but for being patriotic and helping the citizens of
this country learn what they need to know,
-
Do you think others with inside
government information that could save your life will be eager
and willing to give you that information?
-
If your neighbors start disappearing
or if you are told we need to go to war with Canada, who will
dare to let you know the truth behind this?
The Attorney General Eric Holder
threw out the carrot that he wouldnt torture or seek the death penalty
for America's hero Edward Snowden but he didnt rule out life
imprisonment.
Who ever thought patriotic Americans would
say, Thank God for Russia?
The U.S. Government is having its puppet
allies
force down planes of Heads of State in violation of international
law. The U. S. Government is willing to commit international crimes and
acts of war to get Snowden back.
If you were Russia, would you trust the
Government of the United States? After the Manning verdict, any
patriotic American whistle blower would have an easier time helping the
American people from Moscow than sitting in isolation in prison in the
United States.
Our government doesnt just go after
whistle blowers. Its locking up attorneys, like Lynne Stewart,
who do nothing but their job in accordance with the
Code of Professional Responsibility.
Just reporting the news can get you life in
the Ecuadorian Embassy, where
Julian Assange is trapped in London
- just for reporting the news - oh and for allowing a condom to break
when he was having sex with a
CIA agent.
Hitlers first casualties were the
press as are Obamas.
Obama might want to pick better bed-fellows
than Herr Adolph. Obama wasn't elected for the purpose of destroying the
Constitution. But now, with super technology, it may be getting
much worse than we think.
The report "Secret
DARPA Mind Control Project Revealed - Leaked Document" came
out a few days ago:
What if the government could change people's
moral beliefs or stop political dissent through remote control of
people's brains? Sounds like science fiction, right?
Well, a
leaked document reveals that the US government, through DARPA research,
is very close to accomplishing this.
Activist Post was recently contacted by an
anonymous whistleblower who worked on a secret ongoing mind-control
project for DARPA.
The aim of the program is to remotely
disrupt political dissent and extremism by employing "Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation" (TMS) in tandem with sophisticated propaganda
based on this technology. TMS stimulates the temporal lobe of the brain
with electromagnetic fields.
The program, conducted by The Center for
Strategic Communication, is based at Arizona State University.
The DARPA funding for this project can be
confirmed on the ASU website here. The head of the project, Steve
Corman, has worked extensively in the area of strategic
communication as it applies to terrorism and "extremism" - or what could
be called "the war of ideas."
That all sounds like science fiction to me.
But there is no doubt that some potentially dangerous research is being
funded. A century ago, we werent even close to having cell phones or
digital watches. So it might be good to have more information about what
our government has in store for you.
If you think our government is flawless and
perfect, watch this
Fallujah video and think about this:
what if somebody did that to your town
and your family?
Obamas war on truth is a war on the
American people that will either end with defeat for the people or with
the people getting up from their couches and ending the apathy.
The Republicans havent been on the side of
the people since 1864 and the Democrats are continuing the Bush's war on
the Constitution as we see it go down in flames. So where does that
leave you?
It leaves you in charge of your destiny - or
you free to mindlessly allow your government and the corporate media to
think for you until there is no more you.
