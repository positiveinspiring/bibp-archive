Oil discussion by participants at the May 1973 Bilderberg Conference. Note that the discussion now focuses on the prospect of Arab oil producers to be given access to "high-yield investments." This led to the secret agreement signed between the US and Saudi Arabia, wherein the latter agreed to cycle Petrodollars via the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency through the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York into "new" US Treasury issues with maturities of at least one year.
Readers who are not familiar with high-yield investment programmes can learn more about them in the downloadable version of THE PROJECT HAMMER FILE available at www.deepblacklies.co.uk
