If the people don't wake up, America will be turned into a socialized
Nazi-like concentration camp.
The elite class has totally hijacked
America for decades now and is preparing to exterminate hundreds of
millions of people all over the world...
It's everyone's responsibility
to inform each other that America is going to have a 2nd American
Revolution soon, and the more people involved in getting back to a small
constitutional federal government, the more peaceful it will be for
everyone. This document outlines the problem accurate and a positive
good solution to this whole mess we are now all in.
Please be a true
blue good person and stand for goodness, honesty, justice, peace, and
prosperity.

Obama Deception Supplement Booklet
(read far below) about the new
Independent Media Film exposing the Obama Administration as
the fraud it is against the working class in America (and worldwide as
well), for the benefit of
the world's power elite class.
Please read, check the facts, see
theobamadeception.net, research
yourself, and think, and then download this document or share
this Scribd link with all your
family and friends and peers and so on; everyone.
The people need to together rise up to
restore constitutional government. The states need to come together to
abolish the current federal government and restore constitutional
government and our rights and freedoms. Currently as of the spring of
2009 this criminal government is planning not only the continued and
current economic crisis but also
biological warfare and genocide, mostly
likely through forced bird-flu
vaccinations of the American and
world's people in 2009 - as bad as that sounds.
Research for yourself.
Most importantly, help educate others;
because the current global criminal elite-run system and their mass
media networks are not going to inform the people of this megaproblem as
it continues. It's up to us to print this out and show everyone that the
puppet of the elite president Obama is not the messiah of the world, but
an astonishing deceiver of the world's common people.
Please has a good read to realize this can
not be made up as fiction, but it actually factual and true information.
This is not anyone's opinion, it is really what is still going on in the
world today, and there is no time to waste in educating each other,
everyone, from coast to coast, around the world, about this.
Only through awareness, or and act of God,
will the elite be stopped from their plans for more war, more economic
depression, and world genocide and world government (knows to them as
their "New
World Order" - when it is actually the Old World
Order/Monarchy still in power and causing all these large-scale
problems in the world today.)
It's far better for We the People to
request the military to round up the global elite criminal terrorists
than to wait for the elite to have the hired military round up and
exterminate the middle class of America in successive waves.
Obama Deception Supplement Booklet
Lovers of Freedom have continuously
struggled against the forces of tyrannical governments for multitudes of
centuries in the ever deceptive and animated contest between the spirit of
enslavement versus the spirit of liberty.
When in the course of world events it becomes
clear government has become intentionally deceitful, destructive, and
murderous - using any form of falsehood, manipulation of media, or theater
as cover for an array of crimes - as well as for the next form of
government, it is a matter of self-defense for the people of the nation and
the world to throw off a corrupt system of government enslavement; and with
expediency set then widely announce another special date, apart from July
4th, that will in the future echo worldly celebrations of the cause of
liberty.
The people should subsequently convene in large
numbers on that date and also through the public global computing system of
the time, for a convention of the people.
The result of the open convention is to have authored, selected, and begun
the implementation of a more protective system of shared rights, law,
governance, and justice for the current and future generations; of any
nation; for the collective happiness of all. The laws of a Republic should
be written clearly in the form of a constitution.
However when once trusted political figures
individually or as a whole concert of corruption, or the distribution of
wealth or establishment system as a whole, betrays the trust of the
citizenry by operating outside of the rules and constraints listed in such a
constitution, then the citizens of the broken republic should take the
stated recommendations of their previous declaration of independence &
constitution, along with methods of self defense, back into their own hands.
More than responsibility, it is the most sacred
duty of the spirit of liberty and justice for all.
By the year 2008, through a persistent stream of offensive actions,
including
9-11-2001, the organization widely known as the United States
Government has declared itself murderous; while bankrupting the working
class of America and instituting fascist rule. It has become evident to
multitudes of people of every nation that the current government is allied
with a cabal of corrupt
international banking, war-mongering, so-called
freemasonic, illuminati or new world order, interests.
Therefore the United States Government has
severely turned away from serving its sacred cause of freedom!
Therefore the United States Government has failed and is de facto
illegitimate as of the time of the announcement of this declaration at the
start of the new peoples convention. Revolution is the only possible cure
for fascism; and it has already gone beyond the need for a once independent
people to have a fresh start! The peoples convention date will be decided
by the truth movement.
Consequently, All of its previous authority over the citizenry is thereby
removed by this declaration; and All freemasonic governments worldwide
should be dissolved entirely by the great many worlds people. All existing
mob-ridden local governments over the individual and the municipalities
should be fully dismantled, re-instituted, and rebooted with a fully
transparent, efficient, protective, and accountable system model the
peoples convention democratically selects.
All civil rights & laws should be voted for in a
true 1-person-1-vote democratic and transparent form - as we always carry a
vital responsibility to together choose what has control over our lives and
what would ensure us maximum safety & happiness.
This progressive change of government should be enabled and empowered by the
entirety of all national and returning armed forces together with all
non-terminated local police and the widespread armed citizenry. No more
system tyranny.
As we acknowledge this world-wide published declaration in multitudes, we
pledge allegiance to each other.
We are firm in our disassociation from the
previous United States Government or any corrupt power.
In unison We
proclaim:
-
to disallow that organization to silence us
-
to control the mass
media or the internet
-
to suppress us
-
to spray chemicals upon or conduct
any experiments on us
-
to detain us
-
to imprison us
-
to terrorize nor
genocide us
-
to tax us
-
to bill us
-
to create dollars or borrow credit, nor
counterfeit paper money
-
to legislate for us nor to adjudicate any
proceedings
-
to direct our armed forces
-
to make war, or make agreements in
our name, nationally or internationally
We are fully aware of our God-given
rights including dissent.

Democracy arises out of the notion that
those who are equal in any respect are equal in all respects; because
men are equally free, they claim to be absolutely equal. Republics
decline into democracies and democracies degenerate into despotisms.
Aristotle
If the world knew how to use freedom without
abusing it, tyranny would not exist.
Tehyi Hsieh
The modern banking system manufactures money
out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of
sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in
inequity and born in sin... Bankers own the earth. Take it away from
them but leave them the power to create money, and, with a flick of a
pen, they will create enough money to buy it back again... Take this
great power away from them, or if you want to continue to be the slaves
of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers
continue to create money and control credit.
Sir Joseph Stamp
former president of the Bank of England
Yes, we did produce a near perfect Republic.
But will they keep it, or will they, in the enjoyment of plenty, lose
the memory of freedom? Material abundance without character is the
surest way to destruction.
Thomas Jefferson

The basic idea behind teaching is to teach
people what they need to know.
Carl Rogers
Awaken peoples curiosity. It is enough to
open minds, do not overload them. Put there just a spark.
Anatole France
Education... beyond all other devices of human origin, is a great
equalizer of conditions of men - the balance wheel of the social
machinery... It does better than to disarm the poor of their hostility
toward the rich; it prevents being poor.
Horace Mann
There is no education like adversity.
Benjamin Disraeli
It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy [life, liberty,
happiness
] in creative expression and knowledge.
Albert Einstein
We think of the effective teachers we have had over the years with a
sense of recognition, but those who have touched our humanity we
remember with a deep sense of gratitude.
