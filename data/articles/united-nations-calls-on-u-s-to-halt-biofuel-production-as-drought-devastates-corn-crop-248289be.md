Devastates Corn Crop

With the drought of 2012 - already the worst in
the U.S. since the 1950s - expected to cause dramatically smaller corn and
soybean crops, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) has called on the U.S. to suspend the use of corn in producing
biofuels like ethanol in order to avert a food crisis.
So far, however, Agriculture Secretary Tom
Vilsack has rejected this suggestion, arguing that ethanol production
supports many jobs and reduces the price of gasoline for Americans.
Under the
Renewable Fuel Standard, 13 billion gallons of biofuel must
be produced in the U.S. this year as a way to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and dependence on imported oil.
As a result, about,
-
40% of the corn crop will be used to
make ethanol
-
40% as animal feed
-
20% is eaten by consumers, mostly in
processed foods like high-fructose corn syrup and corn flakes
Critics of the fuel standard argue that the use
of corn to make ethanol is a major factor in the tripling in the price of
corn since 2005 and likely contributed to a
food crisis in 2007-08.
The
latest forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) indicate
that the 2012 corn yield per acre will be the lowest since 1995-96, and that
total production will be the lowest since 2006.
As a result, the USDA is predicting that farm
prices for corn will average $7.50-$8.90 per bushel, up from the $5.40-$6.40
per bushel it projected just a month ago and up to 85% higher than the $4.80
per bushel projected at planting time in April. Some private forecasters
have projected even lower yields per acre, which would lead to even higher
prices.
For American consumers, the USDA estimated in July that food prices would
climb 3%-4% in 2013, but that prediction will probably be revised upward
because of the new, lower corn numbers. Even so, the overall economic effect
in the U.S. will be muted because American households generally spend only
about 13% of their budgets on food and because so little of what we pay at
the supermarket is actually for food.
For example, the corn in a $4.00 box of corn
flakes is worth about 7 to 8 cents. Most of the price is for processing,
transportation, advertising, and an
oligopoly premium.
The poor and near-poor, however, will feel the
price rise at the grocery store far more acutely.
It is in the developing world, where many people spend 30%-40% of their
income on food, that the impact will be greatest. Writing in the Financial
Times, Jose Graziano da Silva, director general of the FAO, argued
the ethanol quota should be suspended to allow more of the corn crop to be
used for food production, especially in light of an FAO report that world
food prices soared 6% in July, with the price of corn up 23%.
In addition to the U.S. drought, severe weather
has damaged agricultural production in other major grain exporting countries
as well, including,
-
Brazil
-
Russia
-
Australia
-
India,
...raising concerns of global food shortages
that will increase food prices and lead to widespread hunger.
The United States is the worlds largest
exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat, and likely price spikes will
ripple through markets globally, with devastating consequences for those
already struggling to get enough food to eat,
said Eric Mu√±oz, a senior
policy analyst with the international aid group Oxfam.
U.S. livestock producers, who feed corn to their
animals, also want the ethanol quota waived, and 156 House members and 25
senators have signed letters to Lisa Jackson, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, asking her to issue a waiver on the
ethanol standard.
