We have endured financial oppression for long enough. In a time of national
crisis and shared sacrifice, the richest one-tenth of one percent of the
population cannot continue on their merry way, living in obscene wealth and
detached from reality, while the majority of the population desperately
struggles to make ends meet.
We are under attack, and its time to fight
back.
mmmmmmm
I work over 60 hours a week and still barely
make ends meet. Increased costs of living and thousands of dollars in
medical bills have made me and my family move three times in the past three
years to downsize and cut living expenses.
Im certainly not alone in this dire economic
situation, tens of millions of Americans are fighting this daily war to keep
their family fed and healthy with a roof over their head.
In fact, as long as I can keep up this intensive work schedule at my current
income level, Im actually better off than many Americans. Over
46 million Americans are currently relying
on food stamps to feed their family, over 50 million cant afford health
care,
62 million have zero or negative net worth
and 64% of Americans have less than $1000
saved.
As the economic downturn begins to accelerate
once again, the majority of the population, which has been struggling for
over three years now, is going to be pushed to a breaking point.
Meanwhile, in this time of national crisis, as we keep hearing calls for
shared sacrifice, tens of trillions of dollars are consolidated within the
hands of the economic top one-tenth of one percent of the population.
This unprecedented consolidation of wealth
continues unabated, as we now have the most severe inequality of wealth in
American history. U.S. millionaire households now have over
$46 trillion in wealth, yet only one-tenth
of one percent of the population makes over
$1 million per year.
Let me be clear, I dont fault a person for being rich. If you are great at
what you do and work hard, you should be financially better off than people
who slack off, are bad at what they do and dont work hard. Almost all
Americans agree with that. However, the problem we currently have is that
people who are extremely bad at what they do are now all too often the
people who have the most money.
For example, the very people who caused this
economic crisis have profited off of it and are now among the
richest people in the world.
The reality of our current crisis is that we now have an
aristocracy in this country that lives
beyond the rule of law. They have used their wealth to rig the government
and the economy. Through campaign finance, lobbying and the revolving door
between Washington and the most powerful global corporations, the worlds
richest people have now effectively rigged the system against hardworking
Americans.
This economic crisis is the result of a
deliberate systemic looting engineered by the global financial elite. To
attempt to dismiss this reality as some unproven conspiracy theory is to
display a stunning level of ignorance.
Just look at the bailout of Wall Street: trillions of dollars in national
wealth were given to the people who engaged in
fraudulent activity and crashed the
economy. They then used the publics wealth to give themselves all-time
record-breaking bonuses.
And now, while the rich people who caused this
crisis have never been richer, the government is giving them
tax breaks and cutting vital programs that
we need to keep our society functioning. To say that America has descended
into a neo-feudal banana republic is not using bombastic rhetoric or
hyperbole, it is a technical fact to anyone who spends time analyzing our
current economic and socio-political condition.
As our society is incrementally and steadily deteriorating, millions of
people are growing more desperate by the day.
American families can no longer remain passive
when under such a prolonged and ongoing economic attack. We literally cant
afford to. Clearly, this is a highly unsustainable and dangerous situation
that cannot continue for much longer. A small fraction of society has
systemically robbed the country and destroyed the economic future of the
majority of the population.
As more people realize this, and as desperate
times continue, the mega-wealthy will eventually reap what they have sown.
To understand our future prospects, we just need to look at the civil unrest
that is currently spreading throughout the world. The same people who robbed
America have also robbed many other countries. People worldwide who have
been pushed into severe poverty are rebelling because they have no other
choice. Its either fight back or let your family die a slow death.
The massive protests and riots that have swept
from Cairo to London are just the first wave of a tsunami of rebellion and
unrest that, if the present course is not urgently and significantly
changed, is sure to hit America soon.
Even the Wall Street friendly press, such as Market Watch, are publishing
reports
like this one from veteran journalist
Paul B. Farrell:
What a year. Rage in London, Egypt, Athens,
Damascus
Warning: More rage is dead ahead.
Across our planet a new generation is filled with rage. High
unemployment. Raging inflation. Dreams lost. Hope gone. While the
super-rich get richer and richer.
Listen to that hissing: The fuse is rapidly burning, warning us. Wake up
before the rage explodes in your face. This firestorm is endangering
Americas future
.
Super-rich addicts are destroying the American Dream for everyone.
Theyre destroying the American economy. They dont care about you. Yes,
they hear the ticking time bomb. Theyre stockpiling cash. Dont say you
werent warned. The IMF sees a new collapse sweeping across the planet.
Open your eyes. Youre not watching a film. This is not a metaphor.
Plan now for the revolution, class warfare,
market crash, economic collapse, plan for another depression.
Contagion of Global
Unrest Spreads Worldwide
Unfortunately, as we see
spreading throughout the world, the
blacklash by impoverished and economically disenfranchised people is already
taking a violent turn for the worse.
All throughout the UK, which is economically
comparable to many American states, financially oppressed people have
resorted to rioting and looting. While the fallout and financial loss from
these riots have only been a small fraction of the economic looting global
bankers have inflicted upon the British population, it is horrifying to see.
The popular German news outlet Der Spiegel
recently featured
this article:
A Society on the Verge of a Meltdown
The riots in London are a social
Fukushima for the Western world. Should we really be surprised that an
increase in wealth for just a few, accompanied by simultaneous
impoverishment of the masses, could not continue unabated?
But with all due respect, the only thing astonishing here is the actual
astonishment. Who really thought it could simply go on indefinitely like
this? Who believed there would be no consequences to the increase of
obscene wealth for a few while impoverishment simultaneously plagued the
masses. Wealth disparity is no accident
We famously learn little from history. But
if we take one thing from the Weimar era it should be this: The res
publica amissa, or the neglected polity, will fail in the end.
John Pilger, an award-winning
London-based journalist, summed up the riots in
this report:
Damn it or fear it, the forbidden truth is an
insurrection in Britain
Such is the truth of [UK Prime
Minister] David Camerons sick society, notably its sickest, most
criminal, most feral pocket: the square mile of the City of London
where, with political approval, the banks and super-rich have trashed
the British economy and the lives of millions.
This is fast becoming unmentionable as we
succumb to propaganda once described by the American black leader
Malcolm X thus: If youre not careful the newspapers will have you
hating the oppressed and loving the people doing the oppressing.
Phil Rockstroh exposed the corporate
mainstream medias biased reporting in
this article:
Life in an Age Of Looting
According to the
through-the-looking-glass cosmology of mass media elitists, when a poor
person commits a crime of opportunity, his actions are a threat to all
we hold dear and sacred, but, when the hyper-wealthy of the entrenched
looter class abscond with billions, those criminals are referred to as
our financial leaders.
Regardless of the propaganda of free market fantasists, the great
unspeakable in regard to capitalism is its wealth, by and large, is
generated for a ruthless, privileged few by the creation of bubbles,
and, when those bubbles burst, the resultant economic catastrophe
inflicts a vastly disproportionate amount of harm upon those - the
laboring and middle classes - who generate grossly inequitable amounts
of capital for the elitist of the fraudster class
by having the life
force drained from them by the vampiric set-up of the gamed system.
Even in Germany, which has a better economic
situation than most other European countries, people are burning
luxury fat cat cars.
Arsonists Torch Mercedes, BMWs in Berlin Protests
Arsonists have set fire to 26 cars
in the German capital in the last two days, mainly from Daimler AG (DAI)s
Mercedes, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) and Volkswagen AG (VOW)s
Audi, police said today.
That brings the total number torched this
year in Berlin to at least 138, more than double the figure for all of
2010
The arsonists want to hit what they say are Fat Cats, Berlin police
spokesman Michael Gassen said. A special unit is investigating the fires
as political crimes after the police received letters claiming
responsibility that derided globalization, gentrification and rising
rents, he said.
Israel is another financially better off
nation that has seen massive protests. Hundreds of thousands of people
throughout the country have been protesting the high cost of living.
Some protesters even brought out a functioning
guillotine on a street named after an infamous banking family.
As Washingtons Blog
summed it up:
Indeed, these pictures from Israeli
protests on
Rothschild Boulevard last week show
that people worldwide are getting sick and tired of the wealthiest
acting like despotic kings:
mmm
This past weekend,
over 430,000 people protested throughout
Israel in the countrys largest demonstration ever.
This week, hundreds of thousands of workers went
on strike in
Italy and Spain. In Greece, yet another
country that has been looted by the same people that have robbed the U.S.,
they have seen increasingly violent protests. There have been many
violent clashes with the police. They even
blew up JP Morgan offices and have
repeatedly attacked the
Ministry of Finance in Athens.
Throughout the world
the situation is the same:
rising costs of living, rampant poverty and
unemployment, lower income and increasingly dire economic prospects for
the overwhelming majority of citizens, while 0.1% of the population, the
people who caused this economic crisis, are richer than ever.
Unfortunately, most of the American public has
been propagandized and they still do not fully comprehend this blatant
reality. U.S. corporate television news has blinded much of the U.S.
public to this highly volatile situation.
The saddest part is that we know how to
begin fixing this problem, yet common sense
steps are not being taken. We can start by breaking up the too big to fail
banks that hold us hostage and hold their top executives accountable. We can
also end the
system of political bribery that allows the mega-wealthy to control our
political processes through campaign finance, lobbying and the revolving
door.
Those are the first steps that absolutely need
to be taken. Anyone who spends time researching our political and economic
system will come to these obvious conclusions. These are common sense steps
that are in the interests of 99.9% of the population.
However, with the U.S. public so marginalized, confused and unaware of basic
political reality, it appears these changes will not happen.
Therefore, based on much empirical and
statistical evidence, our society will soon descend into outbursts of
rioting and violence.
Preparing for Civilian
Unrest, the Crackdown in the U.S.
Major U.S. cities are getting ready for the blacklash by preparing their
police force riot squads.
New York City, the financial capital of the
world, is a geographically clustered region that is home to millions of poor
people - significantly large populations in highly impoverished
neighborhoods are only a stones throw away from Wall Street.
As this
recent report reveals, the New York City
Police Department is urgently preparing for unrest:
In wake of British riots, New York police prepare for
unrest
New York police anti-riot units
assembled last week at a training facility on Randalls Island to
prepare for an outbreak of civil unrest similar to those that have
occurred recently in Britain.
The August 12 mobilization exercises
brought together police from all five of the citys boroughs, including
specialized units such as mounted police and aviation.
The riot training was held just days after the New York City Police
Department (NYPD) announced the formation of a new juvenile justice
unit, which is to include detachments of cops assigned to troll
Internet social media sites like Facebook and Twitter in search of any
indication of impending disturbances
.
The training mobilization of the NYPD, however, makes it more than clear
that the ruling elite on the other side of the Atlantic is quite
conscious that the conditions of social inequality, poverty, police
abuse and attacks on social services and conditions that exist in both
Britain and America can trigger an explosion in New York City.
In terms of income distribution, New York City, the capital of the U.S.
financial sector, is the most unequal major city in the U.S. and is
among the most unequal cities in the world. According to recent figures,
the citys top 1 percent monopolizes 44 percent of income.
The citys boundaries encompass both Wall
Street, where top executives rake in salaries and bonuses amounting to
hundreds of millions of dollars, and the Bronx, the poorest county in
the country. If it were a country, New York City would be one of the
most unequal in the world, ranking between Chile and Honduras.
Sitting atop this social powder-keg is Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of
the richest of New York Citys 58 billionaires
.
The combination of stark social inequality, depression-level
unemployment in many city neighborhoods, ever-escalating budget cuts and
relentless police harassment are creating the conditions for a social
eruption in Americas largest city.
Violence is on the rise throughout New York
City.
Over Labor Day weekend,
48 people were shot and killed in a rash of
random shootings. New York is far from the only city in the country to be in
imminent danger of mass civil unrest and increasing violence. Nine major
U.S. cities currently have a poverty rate over the critical threshold of
25%.
As the economic downturn once again accelerates,
there are many terrifying and ominous indicators. One leading indicator for
unrest is youth unemployment. The percentage of young Americans who are not
in the workforce, eligible workers up to the age of 24, is now at a
record high of 51%.
As another example of a major U.S. city on the edge, in Milwaukee the
poverty rate is currently hovering around 30%.
Note:
The above graphic is based on
2009 Census data.
The poverty rate has
increased since then.
Among African-American men in the region, 50%
are now unemployed (below video.)
Milwaukee has recently seen several small-scale
riots, a violent flash mob riot just broke out at a
local state fair.
As we have seen historically and recently throughout the world, the first
phase of economic disenfranchised backlash leads to riots where people who
are deeply impoverished look for the nearest person to attack or the nearest
store to loot or vandalize. This eventually leads to clashes with local law
enforcement - much like we have already seen in San Francisco (see below)
and on a larger-scale in London.
Throughout the U.S., as just mentioned, we have
also seen the start of violent
flash mobs, a trend many believe will
continue to grow and occur more frequently.
After this initial emotionally-driven phase,
there tends to be
more sophisticated acts of crime and violence directed at
banks, politicians, mega-wealthy individuals and rich gated-communities, as
we have started to see sporadically throughout Greece, Germany, France,
Spain and Italy.
The bottom line is that we will inevitably see many more civil
disturbances throughout the United States, and the Army, just like the
NYPD, is currently preparing for such occasions.
As
this report from Tom Burghardt
reveals:
As Economy Tanks, New Normal Police State Takes
Shape
Civil Disturbances: Emergency
Employment of Army and Other Resources, otherwise known as Army
Regulation 500-50, spells out the responsibilities, policy, and
guidance for the Department of the Army in planning and operations
involving the use of Army resources in the control of actual or
anticipated civil disturbances. (emphasis added)
With British politicians demanding a clampdown on social media in the
wake of London riots, and with the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) agency
having done so last week in San Francisco, switching off underground
cell phone service to help squelch a protest against police violence,
authoritarian control tactics, aping those deployed in Egypt and Tunisia
are becoming the norm in so-called Western democracies.
As the excerpt above references, in San
Francisco, after the police fatally shot a person, protests broke out and a
police state crackdown occurred, similar to the attempts to stifle free
speech in Egypt.
As the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
sums up here:
BART Pulls a Mubarak in San Francisco
This week, EFF has seen censorship
stories move closer and closer to home - first Iran, then the UK, and
now San Francisco, an early locus of the modern free speech movement.
Operators of the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART) shut down cell phone service to four stations in downtown
San Francisco yesterday in response to a planned protest
One thing is clear, whether its BART or the cell phone carriers that
were responsible for the shut-off, cutting off cell phone service in
response to a planned protest is a shameful attack on free speech. BART
officials are showing themselves to be of a mind with the former
president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, who ordered the shutdown of cell
phone service in Tahrir Square in response to peaceful, democratic
protests earlier this year.
Free speech advocates have called out
British Prime Minister David Cameron for considering new, broad
censorship powers over social networks and mobile communication in the
UK, and we are appalled to see measures that go beyond anything Cameron
has proposed being used here in the United States.
To see how far the U.S. police state is going,
the Department of Homeland Security just sent out a
bulletin warning
financial corporations of an upcoming non-violent protest on Wall Street
this
September 17th.
Police are now employing unprecedented measures
to stifle First Amendment rights.
In another recent example, an artist who painted
a picture of a JP Morgan Chase bank on fire, to symbolize the financial
crisis, was visited at his home by police questioning him as a potential
terrorist (below video).
Its Time for Aware
Citizens to Hold the Richest 400 Americans Personally Responsible
Theres class warfare, all right,
but its my class,
the rich class, thats making war, and were winning.
Warren Buffett
Chairman and CEO of Berkshire
Hathaway
Obviously,
...all bare direct responsibility for our
economic suffering.
First and foremost, they deserve most of the
blame.
mmmmm
We need to hold them all personally responsible
and apply mass direct action and pressure upon them.
That being said, at this urgent point in our national crisis, as the
economic situation grows increasingly severe, we need to also focus on the
richest 400 Americans and hold them personally responsible as well. We need
to get in their face and call them out in a non-violent manner.
It is not my intention to demonize all 400 of the richest Americans. Some of
them are well-meaning and hardworking people. However, as the primarily
beneficiaries of a rigged and predatory economy, they must all acknowledge
that the system that has produced their immense wealth is now overrun with
corruption and society is breaking down as a result.
At this point, even the billionaires who havent had a direct role in
creating this financial crisis need to be held responsible. As a person who
has benefited so greatly, and has acquired so many resources, whether they
like it or not, they are now in a position of responsibility.
The richest 400 Americans personally have the
power and wealth necessary to financially support organizations and
politicians who will fight for much needed changes. If they are unwilling to
put their immense power behind changing this dire situation, they too must
be held personally responsible.
Im extending an olive branch to these 400 billionaire Americans. Im giving
them fair warning. Either use your wealth and power to make urgently needed
changes, or you too will end up like tyrants of the past.
Our country and our families have endured systemic financial oppression for
long enough. In a time of national crisis and shared sacrifice, the richest
one-tenth of one percent of the population cannot continue on their
merry
way, living in obscene wealth and detached from reality, while the majority
of the population desperately struggles to make ends meet.
The last thing I want to see is rioting and violence.
However, as we have seen throughout the world,
it is evident that you cannot rob tens of millions of people of their
economic security, dignity and future and expect society to continue
functioning business as usual. All the gated communities and private
security you can buy still wont be enough to save you from tens of millions
of desperate and enraged people.
As the economic crisis once again begins to accelerate, the overwhelming
majority of Americans are hanging by a thread. When the inevitable wave of
unrest hits our streets, the masses will be looking in your direction - this
you can be sure of. Either start fighting for much needed changes or face
the consequences of your actions, and inactions.
To paraphrase Percy Bysshe Shelleys The
Mask of Anarchy,
We are many - you are few.
Are the 400 richest Americans going to stand and
fight for America, or is history going to remember them as short-sighted,
delusional, narcissistic and despotic tyrants?
The choice is theirs.
Which side of history will they be on? From here on in, the people will be
watching their every move. We want to know what these 400 billionaires are
personally doing to solve our financial crisis. In the days ahead, we will
track their political activities.
Here are the 400 richest Americans according to
Forbes Magazine:
