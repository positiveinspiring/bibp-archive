Respected Middle East expert and former BBC
presenter Alan Hart has broken his silence on 9/11, by revealing that
the world's most prominent civil engineering company told him directly that
the collapse of the twin towers was a controlled demolition.
Speaking on the Kevin Barrett show yesterday, Hart said he thought
the 9/11 attack probably started as a Muslim operation headed up by
Osama
Bin Laden but that the plot was subsequently hijacked and carried out by Mossad agents in collusion
with elements of the CIA, adding that since its
formation, Israel has penetrated every Arab government and terrorist
organization.
"My guess is that at an early point they
said to the bad guys in the CIA - hey this operation's running what do
we do, and the zionists and the neo-cons said let's use it," said Hart,
making reference to how top neo-cons like Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and their
fellow
Project For a New American Century authors had called for a
"catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor," the year
before 9/11.
"The twin towers were brought down by a controlled ground explosion, not
the planes," said Hart, adding that this view was based on his close
friendship with consultants who work with the world's leading civil
engineering and construction firm.
Hart asked the company to study the collapse of
the twin towers, after which they told him directly,
"There's absolutely no doubt whatsoever that
the towers were brought down by a controlled ground explosion."
Hart then explained how
the five dancing
Israelis seen celebrating the attack on the World Trade Center in New Jersey
as it unfolded, who turned out to be Mossad agents, proves at at a minimum
Israel knew the attack was going to happen.
Hart went further in speculating
that the planes had been fitted with transponders and that the Israelis were
guiding them in to the towers.
Host Barrett pointed out that to carry out the successful controlled
demolition of three of the biggest buildings in history, the conspirators
would have to ensure that they were hit, making the use of remote controlled
airliners a distinct possibility.
In addition, Barrett mentioned the fact that he
had interviewed numerous pilots who dismissed the chances of accurately
guiding a huge commercial airliner into a building while flying at sea level
at around 600 miles per hour, especially considering the alleged 9/11
hijackers struggled to even fly basic Cessna light aircraft.
"Sounding a chilling note, Hart added that
the U.S. is in grave danger of an Israeli-instigated false-flag nuclear
attack, perhaps using an American nuclear weapon stolen from Minot Air
Force Base during the 'loose nukes' rogue operation of August, 2007.
The motive would be to trigger a U.S. war
with Iran, and perhaps to finish the ethnic cleansing of Palestine under
cover of war - which Hart is convinced the Zionists are planning to do
as soon as the opportunity presents itself," writes host Barratt.
Given his biography and standing, Hart's
comments are not to be taken lightly.
Hart is a former Middle East Chief Correspondent
for ITN News and has also presented for BBC Panorama specializing in the
Middle East. He was also a war reporter in Vietnam and the first journalist
to reach Suez Canal with the Israeli army in 1967.
Over the decades, Hart
has developed close relationships with numerous high profile political
figures, including the Shah of Iran, Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres.
Hart has been a successful author for years and has no reason to fabricate
the fact that a top construction firm told him point blank that the towers
were brought down in a controlled demolition.
In forwarding this information, Hart joins legions of other credible experts
who to some extent or other have all publicly challenged the official 9/11
story, with many outright stating that the attacks were an inside job,
people like 20-year decorated CIA veteran Robert Baer, who told a radio host
that,
"the evidence points at" 9/11 having had aspects of being an inside
job.
In addition, no less than 1198 architectural and engineering specialists
have signed a petition demanding Congress re-open an official investigation
into the 9/11 attack and the collapse of the twin towers.
