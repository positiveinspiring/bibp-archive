It has become clear to us that most people still
do not grasp the reality of where our global financial system really stands.
We are on the verge of a systemic financial
implosion that could very nearly wipe out the currency holdings (bank
accounts) of hundreds of millions of people, and with each passing day, that
long-postponed day of financial reckoning inches ever closer.
"If the European summit could reach a deal
on December 9, its next scheduled meeting, the eurozone will survive. If
not, it risks a violent collapse,"
writes Wolfgang Munchau of the
Financial Times. Two years ago, such language would have been spat upon
as "doom and gloom fear mongering."
Today it is the mathematical reality across the
European Union.
The Polish foreign minister
said today that what Europe faces is "a
crisis of apocalyptic proportions" and urged what is essentially more
useless debt bailout tactics to try to delay mathematical reality a little
while longer.
I now believe that when the dust settles after the coming debt implosion
wreaks economic havoc across the globe, more than a few banksters and
money-changers will find themselves indicted, imprisoned, or possibly just
hanging from a tall tree at the end of a short rope.
That's how angry the public is going to get when
the full realization of the unprecedented theft and criminality of the
global banking elite hits them, I fear.
10 days to the
economic implosion of the Eurozone?
The EU's present economic system may not survive the next few weeks.
Even if some creative, shifty accounting can be
ginned up to keep EU nations solvent, it will only be done so as a temporary
delay in the inevitable financial collision that now approaches. Before
long, even the denialists and mainstream news minions will have to admit
that these global banksters have destroyed the economies of entire nations
in much the same way that
the Federal Reserve has all but destroyed
America's economic future.
The dishonest, debt-mounting schemes which have
been pursued by the derivatives-infected global banking industry are nothing
less than campaigns of financial terrorism waged against the working people
of our planet - people who shall, of course, foot the bill for the
inevitable damage and destruction that will result.
The criminality of the banksters now seems emboldened by a sense of lawless
arrogance:
A large brokerage firm known as MF Global
recently collapsed and simply stole the assets of all its customers:
Meanwhile, Britain is drawing up emergency plans
for the
collapse of the Eurozone.
And we now learn that secret Federal Reserve
loans pumped $13 billion of profits into the hands of banks which were on
the
verge of systemic failure.
The banksters are stealing everything from the
working class, and governments are going along with the theft, riding
shotgun on what is without question the greatest swindle in history.
This is
what happens when you give up your national sovereignty or turn over control
of your money supply to a private, non-government corporation such as the
Federal Reserve. This is what happens when you deregulate financial
institutions and let the Goldman Sachs controllers influence Congress to get
the (corrupt) legislation they want.
What we're dealing with here is runaway
criminality... not capitalism... and it's all about to blow up right in the
faces of those who have tried to cover it up for the past several years.
A FEMA RESCUE camp is
ready and waiting for you
Now, in case you're thinking about taking to the streets and protesting all
this when the financial implosion steals whatever might be remaining of your
hard-won savings, think again:
The U.S. Senate is moving to enact a law that
would allow military troops to march on U.S. soil and arrest American
citizens with no due process, no trial, no legal representation and no
protection under the Bill of Rights.
Americans could be thrown in secret
military prisons, interrogated, tortured and held indefinitely without ever
being charged with a crime!
It's all part of the new "National Defense Authorization Act" (S.1867) which
features a section called the "worldwide indefinite detention without charge
or trial" provision.
"The power is so broad that even U.S.
citizens could be swept up by the military and the military could be
used far from any battlefield, even within the United States itself,"
says the ACLU.
Sen. Lindsey Graham even explained in plain
language that the bill is being written to detain American citizens anywhere
in America! His words on the Senate floor:
"...1031, the statement of authority to
detain, does apply to American citizens and it designates the world as
the battlefield, including the homeland."
In other words, the total military police state
tyranny will soon be overt and official.
So let's dispense with the silly talk that we
live in a "free" nation. Enough of the childish accusations that people like
Alex Jones are only spouting "conspiracy theories" about the police state.
When the U.S. Senate fronts a bill that, in
plain language, authorizes the use of the military to conduct secret arrests
of American citizens on any "battlefield," including the "battlefield" right
outside your front door, the tyranny is no longer a theory, folks - it's an
historical fact! It's time we all woke up to the nightmare reality and did
something about it for a change.
This legislation, not surprisingly, was drafted by the globalist traitors
Senators Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). Sen. McCain,
himself a prisoner of war in Vietnam, apparently believes not enough
Americans have yet experienced what it's like to be held under a tyrannical
regime with no legal rights.
So now he's making sure the U.S. government acts
almost as if it were the North Vietnamese, or North Korea for that matter.
Heck, even in North Korea, the police don't feel your genitals at
checkpoints. That's uniquely a USA form of "sexually perverse
tyranny."
If passed into law, this act would allow the U.S. military to arrest and
imprison American citizens for merely being suspected of so-called
"terrorist-related activities."
"This means Americans could be declared
domestic terrorists and thrown in a military brig with no recourse
whatsoever,"
writes Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars.
"Given that the Department of Homeland
Security has characterized behavior such as buying gold, owning guns,
using a watch or binoculars, donating to charity, using the telephone or
email to find information, using cash, and all manner of mundane
behaviors as potential indicators of domestic terrorism, such a
provision would be wide open to abuse."
The police state crackdown is
being rushed into "law" before the total financial collapse strikes
It is no coincidence, of course, that the
invocation of unconstitutional military powers (and TSA-led highway
checkpoints) is happening at precisely the moment in history when the global
banking system is on the verge of a systemic collapse.
The ramping up of
FEMA camps, the armed raids on
raw milk farms, the "trickle-down tyranny"
now infecting the very fabric of our nation... these are not chance
events. They are all part of an engineered oppression of liberties being
thrust upon the American people in anticipation of large-scale social unrest
(riots) which will almost certainly follow the financial implosion that's
now at our doorstep.
People, it seems, are not happy when everything they've worked for is stolen
from them. Gee, I wonder why? As Gerald Celente says, when the people have
lost everything, and they have nothing more to lose, they lose it!
For the record, we do not condone rioting in the streets, which is why we
work diligently to inform people about all this reality before it happens so
they are not surprised and shocked by it.
Rioters, by definition, are those acting out of
emotional anger, and that comes from being surprised by a sudden escalation
that was unexpected. People like us (and hopefully you) who see all this
coming won't be surprised at all, and we share in the realization that
violent rioting achieves nothing other than a whole lot of spilled blood -
and that blood should be avoided, if at all possible, I believe.
Nevertheless, only a small percentage of people alive today are willing to
awaken to reality.
Most will subsist in a state of self delusion and
irrational denial, all the way to the very day that they lose everything to
the global banking elite.
The laws of
mathematics cannot be argued with
That day of rage is unfortunately coming in America.
I've been warning
people about this for years, and it now seems closer than ever before.
The gullible sheeple, of course, still chuckle and grunt at the idea that
the value of their precious dollars could somehow evaporate virtually
overnight. They do not grasp the mathematics of leveraged debt, and they
have no real awareness of how global fractional reserve banking really
works.
These "ignorant masses" will lose everything.
And being shocked by the sudden change in their fortunes, they will riot in
the streets, at which point they will be rounded up and railroaded into FEMA
camps. That's when the incinerators will be fired up, says
Max Keiser, and the next horrific holocaust will commence
under a police state system of eliminating the "useless eaters."
If that happens, the U.S. government will of course hand-pick the
incinerator administrators from the top ranks of the TSA.
After all, someone who is willing to openly
violate an innocent person's Fourth Amendment rights and sexually molest air
passengers is only one step away from gleefully operating
the Zyklon-B gas
emitters in the shower chamber full of "terrorist resistance fighters" (i.e.
innocent protesters).
As
the Milgram experiments have long proven, a
whopping 70 percent of the population will actively murder innocents if
directed to do so by a person in an apparent position of authority.
(No tyrannical police state has ever suffered from a lack of willing,
power-hungry volunteers who love to wear a uniform and crush the skulls of
innocents, by the way. Even today, TSA jobs are strongly sought after by
those unqualified to do anything other than act as police state bullies...)
Oh, is this all too much for you? Let's tone it down, then, and imagine
governments never commit acts of evil against the People.
Let's play
la-la-land pretend time for a moment and imagine that the U.S. government in
particular will always respect your civil rights, your human rights and the
Bill of Rights - because, we'll imagine, the government operates from a
philosophical foundation of ethical behavior. (Yes, see if you can swallow
that thought for a minute and actually keep it down...)
Ah, but hold on. They're already violating the Bill of Rights with
unreasonable roadside searches and checkpoints.
None of this computes with the bizarre belief that the government is
protective of life, compassionate toward the People or even capable of
operating within the bounds of limited government under which it was
originally created by the People.
And yet, there is one industry the government absolutely loves:
The banking
industry.
Trillions of dollars in magical new money have been created and
handed out to the wealthiest criminal banksters in the USA and around the
world. These are the golden elite of the world's wealthiest criminals.
They're so rich and so deeply invested in
obscene criminality that when they bet the wrong way and stand to lose a few
trillion dollars, the central banks of the world leap to attention and crank
up the printing presses to bail them out! (... leaving you and I to foot the
bill through the loss of value in the currency we foolishly hold by
depositing our money in many of those same banks!)
No government of the world, you see, will bail out its own citizens.
But
they will gladly bail out the wealthy, elite banksters who, more than
anyone, deserve to be publicly prosecuted for committing the most heinous
white-collar crimes our world has ever seen.
You won't be bailed
out; you'll be buried
So don't expect for one minute that YOU are going to bailed out, or have
your rights protected, or valued in any way whatsoever by the global
governments or the banksters that pull their strings.
You and us are fodder to the globalists. We are
already soylent green on the menu. Our cash is already in the process of
being stolen, we just haven't fully added it up yet.
Our rights have already been dismissed and trampled, and now the thuggish
grunt-minded minions of the TSA are merely trying to drive that point home
in the minds of Americans by groping, molesting and in some cases sodomizing
innocent Americans. What
Sandusky did to little boys over the last fifteen
years at Penn State, the TSA - a bastion of pedophilia and psychopathic
criminals - is doing every single day across the airports of America.
Prison is not nearly appropriate enough for the crimes these government
psychopaths are committing right now under the guise of "protecting us from
terrorism."
These uniform-wearing monsters deserve a special
place in Hell that's reserved for the serial rapists, the mass murderers,
the pharmaceutical drug reps and evil genius bioweapons scientists.
We
predict there will be no reconciliation against these tyrants who now
believe they are above the law (and above the "little people" like you and
me).
When the masses are finally awakened to the full
extent of the tyranny that has already been unleashed upon them, I pity
those who took part in this system of great, unforgiveable evil - a system
that may yet give Nazi Germany a run for its money in the degree of evil
being unleashed upon our world.
Financial collapse and
tyranny go hand in hand
The clock is ticking on both counts:
The financial implosion and the total
tyrannical crackdown against liberty and freedom.
They are strongly correlated events, as the
former forces the hand of
Big Government to roll out the latter.
Those who are caught sandwiched between these historical trends will find
themselves either broke, imprisoned or incinerated (or maybe all three in a
row). Only those who have the presence of mind to recognize the reality
around them will have any chance at surviving all this and then taking part
in the restoration of civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in the next
society.
It's going to be an interesting ride.
May God have mercy on the souls of
those who have unleashed the destruction we are about to witness, because I
do not believe the once-awakened sheeple of the world will have any mercy at
all. They're the ones, after all, that will be surprised by everything that
is about to unfold.
Thomas Jefferson famously wrote the following commentary about rebellion:
"God forbid we should ever be twenty years
without such a rebellion.
The people cannot be all, and always, well
informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to
the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under
such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the
public liberty...
And what country can preserve its liberties,
if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people
preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to
set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them.
What signify a
few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It
is its natural manure."
It is my great desire that we can find a way to
refresh the tree of liberty without the blood of patriots and tyrants.
Peaceful revolution - and the rational restoration of liberty is always
preferable to bloodshed.
And yet, as JFK famously said on this very
point,
"Those who make peaceful revolution
impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."
