A documentary wake up call to all families,
regardless of political affiliation, to end Americas spending and debt
crisis.
Let us not engage in the wrong argument, at the wrong time, between
the wrong people, in the wrong country, while the real problems of our time
grow and multiply, fertilized by our own neglect.
John F. Kennedys ever
insightful quote ushers in a haunting warning in this films walk through
Americas new struggle for economic survival in the 21st century.
For those who enjoyed the documentaries:
Capitalism - A Love Story and
Enron - The Smartest Guys in the Room comes a film that highlights
the ongoing
economic collapse from the working class perspective.
An Inconvenient Death
documents the death of the American middle class and the catastrophic debt
that is crushing American society from all directions.
From the ever mounting Federal U.S. deficit, the oblivious inability to
conquer spending, to the ticking time bomb of unfunded liabilities, An
Inconvenient Death of the middle class explores the greatest challenges and
threats to todays working class.
Written and produced by Canadian Andrew Materi, An Inconvenient Death
presents the historical, governmental, political, and personal issues on how
the middle class is slowly fading.
This non-partisan, non-political film
investigates the complexities of the deteriorating American economy and
attempts to spread the blame not merely across poor government policy but
also corporations and individual consumers, while maintaining the central
focus of the film sympathetically on the middle class.
