The real Hillary Clinton
is a flagrant example of brazen corruption,
spanning many decades from Watergate to Whitewater
to Arkansas to the White House.
When you listen to,
the people who have researched Hillary in depth (such as Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash) the people who have worked with her (such as former Clinton insiders Larry Nichols and Dick Morris) the people that claim to have been molested by her (Cathy O'Brien),
the people who have researched Hillary in depth (such as Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash)
the people who have worked with her (such as former Clinton insiders Larry Nichols and Dick Morris)
the people that claim to have been molested by her (Cathy O'Brien),
...you can begin to get a gauge on the real Hillary Clinton.
This is not a person who cares greatly about children, or women, or public service.
The real Hillary Clinton is a stunning and flagrant example of brazen corruption. This corruption has run all the way from Watergate to Whitewater to Arkansas to the White House and spans several decades.
I have said many times that it is truly a wonder that this woman has not been locked up behind bars a long time ago, and at the same time is a sad testament to the state of current society that she is being allowed to run for the highest office in the land - and what's more is being ushered in via blatant election rigging and control of the media. Hillary has great powers of both tenacity and mendacity.
She has gritted her teeth and lied her way through scandal after scandal to somehow survive all sorts of crimes to become the anointed establishment candidate.
Hillary's health is a serious concern, and yet, as the probable recent additions to the Clinton body count seem to show, she will stop at nothing, including murder, to get her hands on the presidency to serve her hidden masters.
Hillary's health
is being majorly covered up.
Up until 2 weeks ago, Hillary had done a successful job of hiding her serious health problems - but it's all come out now, and it's quite scary.
We have evidence in the form of leaked emails, leaked reports from insiders, photos and video clips that the real Hillary Clinton has a whole host of health issues, including:
being regularly confused becoming dazed and distracted (e.g. calling Donald Trump her husband) struggling to walk up, or tripping up on, stairs having "short circuits" where she loses it mid-sentence having a bizarre hole in her tongue indulging in utterly inappropriate laughter erupting into barely containable coughing fits adopting wild crossed-eyed looks going into convulsive seizures on camera in public:

erupting into barely containable coughing fits
adopting wild crossed-eyed looks
going into convulsive seizures on camera in public:
Something is seriously not right with her physical and mental health, and many concerned people are asking what the hell is going on.
There is speculation that the black man seen to be her "handler" is her doctor, with the drug diazepam in his hand, which treats spasms and seizures. Americans are obviously very concerned about Hillary's health.
A recent Rasmussen poll has shown that 59% want Hillary's health records to be released.
The Clintons have run a racketeering operation for a long time,
with the help of the utterly corrupt Clinton Foundation.
Dick Morris humorously describes the relationship of Bill and Hillary as something which began as a romance, transformed into a business relationship, and later metastasized into a racketeering organization (I may add that there was also a significant part where Hillary became the cover up agent of Bill the serial rapist).
Dick knew Hillary at around the age of 30, and saw her flaws and weak points then, only to see them enlarged and entrenched now that she is 68 years old.
According to him, for too many years now Hillary has had a life of entitlement and is addicted to the life of privilege.
Spending so many years in government has meant she doesn't need to drive her own car because she gets chauffeured everywhere, she gets all food and laundry free, and she flies in style (not even 1st class or business class).
Hillary herself famously said, when someone asked her whether she should be president, that the reason was because "it's my turn!"
Hillary isn't about service; she's about power.
The real Hillary Clinton has used positions of power as a tool for self-enrichment at every turn. Looking back through her career, the pattern is very evident. During the Watergate scandal involving Nixon, junior lawyer Bill suggested they use Hillary, who ended up stealing files from the case to make it worse for Nixon.
As I have written about before in the article 44 Reasons to NOT Elect Hillary Clinton, she was fired by her supervisor, lifelong Democrat Jerry Zeifman, who stated that Hillary was an "unethical, dishonest lawyer".
Zeifman refused to give Clinton a letter of recommendation, one of only three employees he refused during his entire career.
She went to the Rose law firm where she (coincidentally of course) got a lot of business from the State of Arkansas when husband Bill was Attorney General there. She later became partner when Bill became Governor of Arkansas (more money for Rose and more money for the Clintons).
Later on, the Clinton Administration in the White House became notorious for selling State secrets to the highest bidder, especially the Chinese.
The pattern continued after the White House when Hillary was Secretary of State from 2009-2013, where she used her private email server to hide all the deals she did to get personal bribe money (via the Clinton Foundation and speaking fees).
The gig is real simple:
use the power of the US Government (via the State Department) to personally enrich yourself.
Make no mistake about it.
Billary Clinton runs a racketeering operation where you have to pay to play, i.e. bribe them through ridiculous "speaking fees" (such as $700,000 for 20 minutes as with Ericsson) and then wait as they pass official legal decision in your favor.
Everyone who looks at it, foreign or domestic, knows this is how the game works.
Did you know that between 2013 and 2015, the Clintons got $2.9 million for 12 speeches to Wall St. firms?
is all about election and vote rigging.
In case you have any doubt as to who the real Hillary Clinton is, just look at the ridiculous facade that was the Democratic national primary and caucus season from February to June 2016.
The whole thing was entirely rigged from start to finish. Bernie Sanders never had a chance...
As Michael Covel of the Daily Reckoning writes:
"Throughout the primaries, Bernie Sanders repeatedly accused the DNC of rigging primaries in favor of Clinton. His campaign knew the process was fictitious, but they lacked hard evidence. Now the proof has been dropped In 19,000+ DNC emails released by Wikileaks late last week DNC officials pretended there was a primary process, selected Clinton because they could, and then made Sanders roll over, look like a fool and finally endorse the Queen. You have to admire the chutzpah of how Clinton operates." "Here are some of her operative's 'techniques' for eliminating the Sanders' threat. And yes, this is straight out of 'House of Cards' Hacked emails revealed DNC officials collaborated with the Clinton campaign months before her actual victory when her chance of winning was still maybe 50%. Emails from DNC communications director Luis Miranda indicated he was pushing negative story angles on Sanders to reporters at Politico and the Wall Street Journal. 'Unbiased' DNC officials actively worked with Clinton's campaign to refute Sanders' allegations against Clinton. The DNC used spies within the Sanders campaign to obtain strategic information for Clinton's use. The DNC tried to attack Sanders over his Jewish beliefs and questioned if he was an atheist to smear him with Southern Baptist voters Don't kid yourself. The fix was always in. DNC officials made sure Sanders was eliminated African dictator-style."

The Craigslist listing for the DNC: actors needed.
The whole thing is a giant act.
There's nothing "democratic" about it.
This doesn't even touch upon the fiasco that was the DNC convention, where paid actors were hired to make it look like Clinton had more support than she did, where Bernie supporters had the lights turned off above them in the convention hall, where Clinton supporters held up signs to block Bernie signs, and so on and so on.
The dirty tricks never end with Hillary.
Hillary is so shameless in her utter corruption that right after former DNC chair Wasserman Schultz was busted in black and white via Wikileaks for conspiring against Sanders, Hillary turned around and hired her for the Clinton campaign the very same day!
You would think that anyone with a conscience, some decency and some morals would apologize and distance themselves from Wasserman Schultz, but it's Hillary Clinton, so think again.
Yet, despite such utter corruption and utter lawlessness, Bernie rolled over like an obedient dog and refused to speak out against it.
The recent Clinton body count
includes 5 more mysterious and suspicious deaths.
Add 'em to the long list.
On top of all the lying, cheating and rigging, there's more:
murder.
I have written about the Clinton body count in the past, and how people close to the Clintons suffered sudden and mysterious deaths, which prompted investigator Gary Aldrich, who worked in the White House as a FBI agent, to say,
"My name would be mud, my FBI career would be over, and I might even be in danger, if the stories coming from Little Rock were true - about how so many enemies of the Clintons ended up having fatal accidents."
Well there are now 5 more possible names (all of whom died in July or August 2016) to add to the list:
John Ashe, former President of the United Nations General Assembly, "accidentally" crushed his own throat (with barbell weights) and died a week before he was scheduled to testify against the Democrat Party and the Clintons. Joe Montano, a former DNC Chairman and at the time of death top aide to VP pick Tim Kaine, died from what was said to be a heart attack on July 25, 2016, the day the DNC started. Being a former chairman, it is fair to assume he may have had inside knowledge of the kind of riggery that was going on. Shawn Lucas, the lead attorney working to expose the DNC fraud case in Florida, was found dead unexpectedly in his home. Shawn was the guy in this video who served the DNC with a class action lawsuit. Coincidence? You decide. Victor Thorn, a prolific author and seasoned investigator of the Clintons who had written over 6 books on their scandals and was apparently the first one to compile the Clinton body count, was found dead too. According to co-workers, he was working on a new book. His brother reported that Victor possessed damaging top secret emails concerning Hillary and Bill. This one is the biggest. DNC staffer and 27 year old Seth Conrad Rich was the Operations Director for Voter Expansion at the DNC. Being in this position would have Seth access to all sorts of voter information. Julian Assange of Wikileaks hinted that Seth may have been the Wikileaks informant in this interview. It was officially said to be a robbery - but the perpetrator(s) took no possessions from the dead body. This Anonymous article states: "Seth Rich's position at the time of his death was Director of Voter Expansion, and he described himself as an analyst. He would have key information about all DNC voter fraud schemes. Rich's death is very convenient for Hillary and the DNC, a little too convenient when you consider that he was the main operator at the DNC with access to all top secret documents."

The corruption has been so flagrant, the lawlessness so blatant and the depravity so shameless that it is now very easy to get a glimpse of the real Hillary Clinton.
Ignorance is a choice, and there's really no excuse for Americans not to inform themselves about this ruthlessly ambitious woman who has the potential to propel the NWO agenda forward in a way never seen before.
After all, Hillary has cosied up to,
Big Banking Big Biotech Big Pharma Israel the CFR,
Big Banking
Big Biotech
Big Pharma
Israel
the CFR,
...and virtually every other power center in U.S. society with the sole intention of getting elected.
Could it be any more obvious...?
