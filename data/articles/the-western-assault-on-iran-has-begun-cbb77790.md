Just like Iraq, it begins with diplomatic and
economic sanctions and open threats which eventually snowball into military
action.
One can only hope that all of this saber rattling coming from Israel, the
United States and the United Kingdom will not evolve into real military
strikes.
However, the sweeping sanctions approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee of
the House of Representatives on Wednesday in the United States will still
significantly damage Iran and its people if they are enacted.
While the sanctions that targeted the Iranian central bank and those who
trade with Iran are now being reconsidered according to U.S. officials, the
push from Israel might be able to force the hand of America even though it
would harm our national interests.
Yet despite all of the posturing, there truly is no evidence that Iran is a
threat to the West.
Even the Israeli news agency
Haaretz has to point out this fact in
writing,
Intelligence services now say it will take
Iran two or three years to get the bomb once it decides to (it hasnt
made the decision yet).
The most dangerous aspect of these types of
sweeping sanctions is that the damage is not immediately apparent to the
outside world and especially the West which has its information spoon-fed to
it by highly biased corporate news sources.
For instance, the sanctions against Iraq which began in August of 1990, just
four days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, resulted in the deaths of an
estimated 500,000 dead Iraqis, most of them children
according to British MP George Galloway.
However, the Iraqi Baathist government estimated that
1.5 million died as a result of the
sanctions and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark
estimated a total of 1.5 million died from
sanctions, bombs and other weapons and depleted uranium (DU) poisoning.
It is clear that the damage from sanctions are not readily apparent and they
usually do not end up harming those who they are intended to target in the
government but instead end up harming regular people who have no impact on
governmental operations or policies.
An article
recently published by AntiWar reveals just
how far-reaching these sanctions are and how damaging they could be for the
people of Iran.
Some of these sanctions were radically unrealistic and harsh and as the
president of the National Foreign Trade Council, Bill Reinsch
pointed out, they,
fly in the face of facts on the ground, the
demonstrable failure of previous sanctions to achieve their stated
purpose, and the basic rules of diplomacy among nations.
Thankfully, it now appears that the U.S. is
backing away from the sanctions which would
target the Iranian central bank over concerns that it would negatively
impact the already fragile international oil market.
That being said, U.S. officials are now saying that they will opt instead to
seek to coerce Iranians major trading allies to join the United States in
enforcing the sanctions that are already in place.
In addition, they are also reporting that the U.S. will create some more
narrowly focused sanctions against Iran according to Paul Richter of
the
Los Angeles Times.
Meanwhile, across the pond, Britain and Israel seem to be gearing up for
all-out war with Iran.
For the first time since 2008,
Israel tested the Jericho 3, an
intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warhead long
distances on Wednesday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been reportedly trying
to push what little opposition he has within his cabinet into getting behind
an attack on Iran with the help of Defense Minister Ehud Barak.
In response to the Jericho 3 test, which was a clear instance of
antagonizing Iran at an all-too-inopportune time, Barak said it was an
impressive technological achievement.
In another suspiciously timed event, Israel released the
details of an air force exercise done in
concert with Italy, using a NATO base, over the Mediterranean Sea which
simulated a long-distance strike, much like what would be utilized against
Iran.
American President
Barack
Obama also said that he had spoken with French President
Nicolas Sarkozy and they both had come to the conclusion,
that international pressure must be
maintained on Iran according to Israeli news agency
Haaretz.
A major factor in this push towards significant
action against Iran is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report
due next week.
This report will allegedly show if Iran is meeting its international
obligations in its nuclear ambitions, although one might argue that this
report could be highly biased given it is coming from a United Nations body.
Some American politicians are not being as coy as others, sticking to the
typical diplomatic language in dealing with Iran.
Rick Perry, a former Bilderberg Group attendee, Republican
Presidential hopeful and current Governor of Texas, has openly said he would
support attacks on Iran.
Obviously, we are going to support Israel.
And Ive said that we will support Israel in every way that we can,
whether its diplomatic, whether its economic sanctions, whether its
overt or covert operations, up to and including military action, Perry
said in an interview on CNN.
This kind of blind support for Israel is what
plagues American politics today. Even when such a move could result in the
death of Americans and/or a significant negative economic impact,
politicians like Perry will happily back Israel to the detriment of our own
nation.
The support within Israel for a strike on Iran is quite considerable as well
with a Dialog Polling Institute poll showing that
41% of those polled backed an Israeli
attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
However, 39% of those polled oppose such an attack while 20% were undecided
on the matter.
The margin of error was 4.6% and only 495 people were polled so one must
consider the small sample size in giving credence to the figure. Dialog
claims that their random sampling represents Israeli adults but the numbers
are far from conclusive at this stage.
Despite the split in the Israeli public, the support for an attack on Iran
amongst the Israeli cabinet does not seem so divided.
Haaretz reports that Israels Foreign
Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, previously did not support an attack on
Iran but was recently persuaded by Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense
Minister Barak to get behind the move.
The Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister, Moshe Yaalon, reportedly
said that he would prefer an American military strike against Iran to an
Israeli one.
Why would we have any interest in attacking Iran? In reality, Iran is not a
threat to the United States but the Israel Lobby likely easily sway
Washington into carrying out the strike for Israel, putting American lives
and money on the line instead of their own.
Similarly, Dan Meridor, the Israeli Intelligence and Atomic Energy
Minister said that he supports an American offensive against Iran.
The London Guardian has reported that Britain is developing military plans
for an attack on Iran in preparation for the IAEA report which has been
characterized as a game changer.
The MoD [Ministry of Defense] says there
are no hard and fast blueprints for conflict but insiders concede that
preparations there and at the Foreign Office have been under way for
some time, according to
The Guardian.
This dovetails with the reports of Obama
planning to increase the American presence in the Persian Gulf, as I
previously
reported.
It appears that the contingency plans have been in the works for some time
and they are seemingly being implemented as I write this.
However, some are speculating that all of this public talk and open threats
are just a covert push to pressure the international community into taking a
hard line against Iran.
For instance, the former director of the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies, Yossi Alpher, said that the discussion of air strikes
against Iran,
might be more to do with persuading the
international community to tighten sanctions, which have so far proved
ineffective, after the IAEA report is published next week, according to
The Week.
Meanwhile, in Iran, the reaction has been one of
marked antagonism with the Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi
saying that Iran is ready for war with
Israel.
Salehi told the Turkish news outlet HÃ¼rriyet Daily,
We have been hearing threats from Israel
for eight years. Our nation is a united nation
such threats are not new
to us.
Salehi also said that any attack would bring
retaliation and Iranian General Hassan Firouzabadi said that Israel
and the U.S. would be harshly punished for an attack in Iran.
We would make them regret such a mistake
and would severely punish them, Firouzabadi said, adding, In case of
an attack by the Zionist regime, the United States would also be hit.
The head of the Iranian Supreme National
Security Council, Saeed Jalili, will
reportedly detail the proof of U.S.-led terrorist plots against Iran at
a ceremony marking the anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis
in Tehran.
This evidence is allegedly so damning that it could bring the U.S.
government down according to an Iranian lawmaker and Deputy Chairman of the
Majilis Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy, Hossein Ebrahimi.
Once Tehran publicizes the evidence in its
possession on the US being a terrorist [state] and [Washington's]
massacres, the American nation would certainly unite to topple their
[ruling] regime, Ebrahimi reportedly
said.
Furthermore, in late September the head of the
Iranian Navy, Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari,
threatened to send military ships off the
Atlantic Coast of the United States.
The tensions are rising and the rhetoric is heated from all sides.
All we can do at this point is gather
information and hope the worst doesnt occur.
