Because American politics continue to reveal the fact that there is no difference between either party or, indeed, any difference between either candidate once that person assumes power, it is easy for some to assume that political races are entirely irrelevant.
There are, however, worst case scenarios.
Clearly, Hillary Clinton represents that scenario. This book (The Difference it Makes - 36 Reasons Hillary Clinton Should Never Be President) is an attempt to prevent that scenario from ever occurring and, as such, it contains 36 reasons why she must never be allowed access to the White House ever again. Among the numerous political candidates who have thrown their hat in the ring for the position of figurehead and front man for the US oligarchy, few can actually be distinguished from one another on even the smallest issues.
Once again, Americans are reminded that the process of American elections is nothing but a theatre a bread and circus for those with an intellectual tinge. Indeed, not a single candidate in the race is truly discernible from any other and, like past presidential races, it is clear that Americans are being given the chance only to choose the brand and presentation of oligarchical rule and not the chance to remove themselves from the oligarchical yoke. There is, however, one candidate that is doing her best to rise above them all - Hillary Clinton. This book began as merely part of a project that was never fully realized a comprehensive series of articles written about each presidential candidate from both major parties detailing why voters should refuse to back these candidates with their vote. It was an attempt to help tear away the veil of political smokescreen that so many Americans fall into every four years.
But, when I first conceived of an article listing reasons why any sane voter should stay far away from Hillary Clinton, the task was quickly dispelled from the possibility of being a comprehensive work due to the fact that the crimes of Hillary Clinton are far too numerous to mention, even in an article of unwieldy length. From her tenure as First Lady of Arkansas and First Lady of the United States, Senator, or Secretary of State, Clintons tales of,
treachery psychopathy deceitfulness viciousness,
treachery
psychopathy
deceitfulness
viciousness,
...are far too numerous to compile in one article.
Clinton has long proven herself one of the most adamant and willing tools of an elite that knows no restrictions in their methods. Indeed, Clinton is very much a part of that oligarchy. The Difference It Makes contains at least 36 reasons why Hillary Clinton should NEVER be allowed to occupy the White House (again).
While 36 may sound like a long list of points directed at one candidate, suffice it to say that the list could have been at least twice as long. In order to have this book released before the primaries, this author was forced to stop allowing the list to grow.
After all, a list of reasons not to vote for Hillary Clinton has stunning similarities to the Kudzu vine. With that being said, however, it is vitally important to understand that this book is by no means an endorsement of any other candidate in the political race for the Presidency. It is merely designed to inform and educate.
Until Americans are truly aware of the issues they face and the legitimate solutions necessary to repair the American economy, restore living standards, return civil liberties and the like, America will be given false choices like Hillary Clinton versus the Republican nomination. There is, however, such a thing as a worst case scenario. It is just this type of scenario that this book (read it here) is trying to prevent.
