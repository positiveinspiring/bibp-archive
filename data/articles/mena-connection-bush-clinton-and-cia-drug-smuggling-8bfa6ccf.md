Governor Bill Clinton and President George Bush - CIA Drugs for Guns
Connection, by Paul DeRienzo.
An independent group of researchers in Arkansas
are charging that Governor Bill Clinton is covering up an airport used by
the CIA and major cocaine smugglers in a remote corner of the Ozark
mountains.
According to Deborah Robinson of In These Times,
the Inter mountain Regional Airport in Mena, Arkansas continues to be the
hub of operations for people like assassinated cocaine kingpin Barry Seal as
well as government intelligence operations linked to arms and drug
smuggling. In the 1980's, the Mena airport became one of the world's largest
aircraft refurbishing centers, providing services to planes from many
countries.
Researchers claim that the largest consumers of
aircraft refurbishing services are drug smugglers and intelligence agencies
involved in covert activities.
In fact, residents of Mena, Arkansas, have told
reporters that former marine Lt. Colonel Oliver North was a frequent visitor
during the 1980's.
Eugene Hasenfus, a pilot who was shot down in a Contra
supply plane over Nicaragua in 1986, was also seen in town renting cargo
vehicles. A federal Grand Jury looking into activities at the Mena airport
refused to hand down any indictments after drug running charges were made
public.
Deborah Robinson says that Clinton had,
"ignored
the situation until he began his presidential campaign."
Clinton then said
he would provide money for a state run investigation of the Mena airport.
But according to Robinson, the promise of an investigation was never
followed up by Clinton's staff.
In fact, a local Arkansas state prosecutor
blasted Clinton's promise of an investigation, comparing it to "spitting on
a forest fire."
