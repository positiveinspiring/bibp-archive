Devastating Our Health

The
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the
world.
With over $38 billion in assets, the Gates
Foundation has the ability to impact the world in a very large way. The
foundation claims to be doing just that, with the stated goal of the company
being to,
"enhance healthcare and reduce extreme
poverty."
Despite this good-natured mission statement, the
foundation's spending goes against its stated goals in almost every way.
Foundation assets are being used for such things
as funding the creation of genetically modified mosquitoes, purchasing
500,000 shares of Monsanto, experimental vaccine nanotechnology, and
supporting Goldman Sachs.
Monsanto is the company responsible for the creation of Agent Orange, which
after being used in the Vietnam War led to over 150,000 being born with
birth defects. Over 3 million Vietnamese adults were also negatively
impacted. Monsanto also created Posilac, which is more commonly known as
bovine growth hormone.
This artificial growth hormone synthetically led
to higher volumes of milk production in cows, in addition to destroying the
animal's health.
However, the damage done was not only limited to
animals. In humans Posilac was found to lead to elevated risks of developing
a tumor, due to increased levels of IGF (Insulin-like growth factor).
Monsanto is now the largest biotechnology company in the world, responsible
for genetically modifying a large portion of the world's food supply.
On August 30, 2010, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation purchased 500,000
shares of Monsanto stock. This company has driven thousands of Indian
farmers to kill themselves after they were unable to pay mass amounts of
debt back to the company. Additionally, the suicide was so prevalent among
farmers in the area that it has been dubbed the "suicide belt" of India.
Farmers who were promised increased revenue by
the biotech giant were soon overcome with debt and regret. Some farmers
drank the very insecticide they were given to use on their crops.
If the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation were
truly attempting to "reduce extreme poverty," like their mission statement
claimed, then why would they support an organization like Monsanto?
In addition to funding Monsanto, the Gates Foundation has also funded the
development of genetically modified mosquitoes.
The mosquitoes, developed by the University of
Queensland, are modified to stop the spread of a virus carried by the
insects. This technology also allows scientists to modify the insects in
other ways, such as engineering the mosquito to produce a vaccine in their
saliva.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases in Bethesda is currently working on a transgenic mosquito that is
essentially a mobile vaccination. If it is successfully implemented,
unsuspecting targets will be injected with a vaccination, even if the person
is opposed to the science behind most vaccinations.
The Gates Foundation is also focused on supporting large corporations.
Goldman Sachs is a well-known global investment banking and securities firm.
In addition to moving their profits offshore to avoid taxation of their $10
billion bailout, Sachs has also purchased pistols for all of its employees
to defend themselves from any uprising.
Why would a company be so afraid of its clients?
The answer is pretty simple; the company is not looking out for them.
For a foundation whose goal is reduce poverty,
this does not seem like a very appropriate business partner. In fact, this
organization is diametrically opposed to the views expressed in the Gates
Foundation's stated goals.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is indeed changing the world.
Unfortunately, it is in a negative way. The foundation funds the genetic
modification of our planet, the siphoning of money from the working class to
the rich, and many other organizations that are dismantling the United
States economy.
Those who donate to this organization, however,
may not be aware of its actions. Just as with other organizations, most of
the donations come from citizens with good intentions.
It is a shame to see that the Gates Foundation
is using the assets of charitable donors to fund the manipulation of the
environment and the devastation of our health.
