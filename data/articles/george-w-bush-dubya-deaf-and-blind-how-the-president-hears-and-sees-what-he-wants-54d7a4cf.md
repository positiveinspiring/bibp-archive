I'm not sure, but I think President Bush just admitted that when somebody
briefs him, he consciously prefers what he wants to hear to what the truth
happens to be.
As do we all, I suppose. But I see no evidence of irony, let
alone self-criticism, in what Bush said. The subject was the National
Intelligence Estimate on Iran, from which, as Slate's Fred Kaplan noted
yesterday, Bush has been distancing himself in private conversations with
foreign leaders.
Here's what Bush said today:
I was making it clear it was an independent judgment, because what they
basically came to the conclusion of, is that he's tryingyou know, this is a
way to make sure that all options aren't on the table. So I defended our
intelligence services, but made it clear that they're an independent agency;
that they come to conclusions separate from what I may or may not want.
Note that Bush didn't say the intelligence services sometimes come to
conclusions separate from what he may or may not believe. It would be bad
form for Bush to say that out loud, because it would undermine part of his
own executive branch. But it would be defensible intellectually. Of course
presidents are going to disagree now and then with conclusions reached by
the intelligence agencies.
One would hope that, in doing so, they give
careful consideration to the known facts. But Bush wasn't saying that. He
was saying that the intelligence services sometimes come to conclusions
separate from what he may or may not want. In affirming this, he seemed
totally unself-conscious.
There is absolutely no evidence that Bush was
describing the necessary mental challenge of rising above what he wants to
hear so that he can take in new information that might alter his
understanding of reality.
Indeed, Bush's statement suggested that he suffers
from a sort of executive learning disability that leaves him unwilling or
unable even to grasp that what he wants to hear isn't always going to be the
same thing as what he needs to hear.

A Charge To Keep
According to
The Bush Tragedy, a new book by Slate's
Jacob Weisberg, Bush
suffers from a similar inability to distinguish between what he wants to see
and what is there to be seen. This is nicely captured in an anecdote about a
painting (above image) that Bush
put up in his office when he was governor of Texas.
Weisberg writes:
In an
April 1995 memo, Bush invited his staff to come to his office to look
at a painting.
The picture is a Western scene of a cowboy riding up a
craggy hill, with two other riders following behind him. Bush told
visitorswho often noted his resemblance to the rider in frontthat it was
called A Charge To Keep and that it was based on
his favorite Methodist hymn
of that title, written in the eighteenth century by Charles Wesley.
As Bush
noted in the memo, which he quoted in his
autobiography of the same title:
"I thought I would share with you a recent bit of Texas history which
epitomizes our mission. When you come into my office, please take a look at
the beautiful painting of a horseman determinedly charging up what appears
to be a steep and rough trail. This is us. What adds complete life to the
painting for me is the message of Charles Wesley that we serve One greater
than ourselves."
Bush identified with the lead rider, whom he took to be a
kind of Christian cowboy, an embodiment of indomitable vigor, courage, and
moral clarity.
Bush subsequently took the painting to Washington, hung it in the Oval
Office, and
continued to tell the painting's inspiring story, adding
embellishments:
He came to believe that the picture
depicted the circuit-riders who spread
Methodism across the Alleghenies in the nineteenth century. In other words,
the cowboy who looked like Bush was a missionary of his own denomination.
Only that is not the title, message, or meaning of the painting. The artist,
W.H.D. Koerner, executed it to illustrate a Western short story entitled
"The Slipper Tongue," published in The Saturday Evening Post in 1916. The
story is about a smooth-talking horse thief who is caught, and then escapes
a lynch mob in the Sand Hills of Nebraska. The illustration depicts the
thief fleeing his captors.
In the magazine, the illustration bears the
caption:
"Had His Start Been Fifteen Minutes Longer He Would Not Have Been
Caught."
The painting was subsequently recycled by the Saturday Evening Post to
illustrate a nonfiction story.
The caption that time was,
"Bandits Move
About From Town to Town, Pillaging Whatever They Can Find."
Koerner
published the illustration a third and final time in a magazine called the
Country Gentleman. On this go-round, it was indeed used to illustrate a
short story that related to Wesley's hymn. But the story's moral was a
little off-message.
According to Weisberg, it was,
"about a son who receives
a legacy from his fathera beautiful forest in the Northeast and a plea to
protect it from rapacious timber barons."
Apparently nobody ever got around
to notifying Bush's Interior Department.
To summarize, the president of the United States is both deaf and blind. I
have already stated, and continue to stand by, my nuanced judgment as to
whether he's dumb.
I propose that we outfit the Oval Office with a pinball
machine.
Dubya: Smart? Or Dumb?
by Timothy Noah
March 13, 2001
Should journalists be avoiding the subject of George W. Bush's perceived
mental deficiencies?
Lately, we've been hearing that they should. In the
March 13 Washington Post, E.J. Dionne Jr. calls for "a moratorium on calling
the president of the United States stupid."
In the March 7 Washington Post,
Michael Kelly called Bush a "smart guy." But where is the evidence for this
hidden intelligence? Dionne says that Bush has proved himself smart by
conning most reporters into thinking he's a moderate. (In fact, Bush is a
moderate as "moderate" is currently defined within an extremely conservative
national Republican party.)
Kelly says that Bush's respect for his core
conservative constituency's few nonnegotiable issues is smart because it
leaves Bush room to compromise on many other issues that matter to swing
voters. This is something every elected official must do, yet Kelly would
never argue that every elected official is smart.
What's really going on? Chatterbox sees several forces at work.
In Kelly's case, the impetus to call Bush "smart" comes from Kelly's own
conservatism and perhaps an urge to establish, after hurling Menckenesque
invective at Bill Clinton for many years, that he isn't a blowhard. The
counterintuitive quality to Kelly's thesis must also hold some appeal.
As a liberal, Dionne frets that if the "Bush is a dummy" perception remains
in place for four years, Bush will evade responsibility for whatever stupid
things he does.
"Before long," he writes, "we expect less of him than we do
of the average city council member or county commissioner."
Borrowing from
Bush's own rap on education standards, Bob Herbert of the New York Times has
pegged this "the soft bigotry of low expectations."
Ronald Reagan benefited
from a similar bigotry, most memorably when he presented his addled and
self-contradictory explanation for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. The
"I'm out to lunch" defense was not available to Bill Clinton when he
explained his role in the Marc Rich pardon because the public knows that
Clinton is not a stupid man. Nor was it available to another obviously smart
man, Richard Nixon, during Watergate.
Another worry for Dionne is that the criticism casts the critic as an "elite
mandarin." It is an odd feature of current political discourse in America
that "equality" is considered a dirty word (unless embedded in the phrase
"equality of opportunity") because it's too liberal, yet "dumb" is also
considered a dirty word because it's inegalitarian.
But if the president
really is dumb, don't journalists have a responsibility to say so, even if
their readers don't want to hear it?
When Chatterbox uses the word "dumb," he is deliberately sidestepping the
great sotto voce debate about Bush: Does he lack innate intelligence, or is
he merely "incurious"? (Even Dionne concedes that Bush is "inattentive.")
Chatterbox doesn't know, and he doesn't care. All that really matters is
that Bush is functionally dumb in the sense that he is visibly ignorant
about all sorts of things the president is supposed to know about.
David
Sanger of the New York Times spotlighted an excellent recent example in a
March 8 story about Bush's talks with South Korean president Kim Dae Jung:
Today Mr. Bush made it clear that he had little intention of following Mr.
Clinton's path, at least not now. In a brief exchange with reporters after
meeting Mr. Kim in the Oval Office, Mr. Bush said:
"We're not certain as to
whether or not they're keeping all terms of all agreements."
But the United States has only one agreement with North Korea - the 1994
accord that froze North Korea's plutonium processing at a suspected nuclear
weapons plant. And at a briefing this afternoon two senior administration
officials, asked about the president's statement, said there was no evidence
that North Korea is violating its terms.
Later, a White House spokesman said that Mr. Bush was referring to his
concern about whether the North would comply with future accords, even
though he did not use the future tense.
"That's how the president speaks,"
the official said.
If that doesn't persuade you, check out this transcript of Bush's first
press conference, where Bush in effect accused a reporter of playing
"gotcha" when he was simply trying to find out Bush's stance toward a
proposed European rapid-reaction force:
Bush: Well, why don't we wait until after [Prime Minister Tony Blair] and I
visit, so I don't have to give the same answer twice.
Reporter:
But just on the whole outline of the question of the European defense
capability...
Bush: You bet. I understand, you're trying to get me to tell you the answer
twice. (Laughter.) Britain and the United States have got a special
relationship; we'll keep it that way. I look forward to talking to the Prime
Minister about the importance of NATO. It is... anyway, let me visit with him
first. I promise to call upon you tomorrow. Nice try.
The following day, when Bush was asked the same question again, it was clear
that Bush's answer - the force would defer to NATO and would probably inspire
European nations to increase their defense budgets - needn't have depended on
any special briefing from Blair. Bush had simply been unfamiliar with the
subject.
The mere fact that journalists like Dionne and Kelly bother to argue that
Bush isn't dumb is itself evidence that Bush is dumb.
After all, nobody ever
bothered to argue that Jimmy Carter or John F. Kennedy wasn't dumb.
Historians have argued, persuasively, that Dwight D. Eisenhower wasn't dumb,
but this is something liberal intellectuals should have understood at the
time. (How could a dummy have survived as Supreme Allied Commander during
World War II?)
More typically, when David Broder and Bob Woodward of the
Washington Post published a series (later a book) arguing that Dan Quayle
wasn't quite as dumb as people said he was, it could be taken as
confirmation that Quayle really was dumb. No politician is as dumb, or as
smart, as the public believes him to be because the public lacks the means
to acquire a nuanced familiarity with his mind.
But the public can usually
form an opinion that's in the ballpark. As Franklin Foer points out in the
March 19 New Republic, the much-maligned "conventional wisdom," though
banal, is usually correct. Lately there's been a lot of revisionist thinking
about Ronald Reagan's grasp of policy nuance based on a cache of recently
unearthed radio commentaries and speeches.
These have been published in a
book, Reagan In His Own Hand, which is being lauded by conservatives. What
Chatterbox sees when he gazes into Reagan In His Own Hand, though, is the
condescension of editor Martin Anderson, a longtime Reagan adviser, and of
George Shultz, who wrote the foreword.
Here's Shultz:
I could tell dozens of stories about specific times when Ronald Reagan
displayed detailed knowledge about policy issues, and when he took decisive
action based on that knowledge - without the benefit of someone whispering in
his ear or sliding a note into his hand. But so ingrained is the belief that
he was an amiable man - not too bright, the willing captive of his
aides - that it would probably not make much difference.
In his introduction, Anderson and his co-editors marvel that Reagan's radio
broadcasts
drew upon hundreds of sources, and his drafts contain thousands of facts and
figures. Sometimes he lists his sources in accompanying documents. In one
case, for an essay on oil, he appended them. At times he cites his sources
in the text.
Now, let's be serious.
If Shultz and Anderson said these things about you,
would you really feel flattered?
Or would you want to punch them in the
nose?
