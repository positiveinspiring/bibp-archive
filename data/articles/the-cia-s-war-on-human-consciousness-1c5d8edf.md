The T.V. Kills Your Brain
With The CIA's
Mass Mind Control Gun.
"From 1950 to 1962, the C.I.A. ran a massive research project, a
veritable Manhattan Project of the mind, spending over $1 billion a year
to crack the code of human consciousness, from both mass persuasion and
the use of coercion in individual interrogation."
Professor Alfred McCoy
author of "A Question of Torture: CIA
Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror."
"Our brain is domineering when it comes to coping with reality. We
sometimes see things not as they really are, sometimes invent categories
that do not exist and sometimes fail to see things that are really
there. There are people who have never seen or heard of an aircraft and
will not be able to imagine it and a real airplane overhead will be
distorted in their minds, creating alternative realities.
To recognize that what we call reality is only a consensus reality (only
what we have agreed to call reality) is to recognize that we can
perceive only what we can conceive. Captain Cook's ship was invisible to
the Tahitians because they could not conceive of such a vessel. Joseph
Pearce explains this best: "Man's mind mirrors a universe that mirrors
man's mind.""

"Remember: those who are at the top of the heap will always take
whatever steps are necessary to maintain the status quo. It is obvious
that they cannot completely control the propagation of the information.
So, how do they "keep secrets?" They don't. Everything is right out
there in the public domain.
Anybody who wants to can do the research we
have done and come to the realizations we have in this process. BUT, not
everyone is able to withstand the OTHER weapon of Mass Control: the fear
of being labeled a "suspected or potential supporter" in a world where
the Grand Inquisitor has total control over life and death."

"Mass Mind Control?"
Before
the CIA and
the NSA decided it was a good
idea to invade your home without your knowledge to spy on you with advanced
appliances, smart phones, computers, and other electronics, they invaded
your mind to manipulate your understanding of reality and history,
especially of epochal events like the JFK assassination and the 9/11
attacks.
It is disturbing to know that the CIA has been inside the public mind for
half a century, and is now using its unthinkable technological capabilities
to invade private homes to document and categorize each individual's
behavioral patterns, lifestyle choices, information preferences, and daily
habits.
Of course, state surveillance spooks cannot track and data-mine every space
of information in this vast social ocean that we call the virtual world.
But, that problem can be managed because the
sharks of the state don't need to be aware of the entire environment to
strike fear in the fishes and other creatures. Just the fact that sharks are
buzzing around is enough to make any thinking fish freeze and adapt his
thoughts, views, opinions, and patterns in order to placate the sharks'
appetite for domination and total control.
The thoughtless fishes don't realize that predatory sharks of the
totalitarian state are hunting them to trap them in their net of
surveillance and eventually kill them.
But it isn't their fault that they're not aware
of this frightening social environment because the CIA has uses its powerful
state and private resources to deny them of this life-sustaining mental
awareness.
The CIA is conducting a covert war on human
consciousness, and
the false flag 9/11 attacks was its greatest propaganda
victory in this unusual war.
The U.S. National Security State's war on human consciousness includes its
suppression of free energy, free thought, and free exchange of ideas. A vast
array of human knowledge and human history is kept hidden from the global
public by CIA spies in the American and global media.
But the suppression of information and historical reality is just one
technique that the CIA has mastered since its murder of the President JFK.
Its greatest mind control technique is also the most ancient: fear.
Since
9/11, the fear of Islam and of mysterious terrorists has defined the public
imagination of America, Israel, and the West.
Prof. Michel Chossudovsky articulated the social and political effects of
state-induced fear in his article called, "AL QAEDA AND HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS:
Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda... An Incessant and Repetitive Public Discourse - Part
I."
Here is an excerpt from Prof. Chossudovsky's
article:
"Human Consciousness: Al Qaeda and the Human
Mindset
How does the daily bombardment of Al Qaeda related concepts and images,
funneled into the Western news chain and on network TV, affect the
human mindset?
Al Qaeda concepts, repeated ad nauseam have potentially traumatic
impacts on the human mind and the ability of normal human beings to
analyze and comprehend the "real outside World" of war, politics and the
economic crisis.
What is at stake is human consciousness and comprehension based on
concepts and facts.
With Al Qaeda, however, there are no verifiable "facts" and "concepts",
because Al Qaeda has evolved into a media mythology, a legend, an
invented ideological construct, used as an unsubtle tool of media
disinformation and war propaganda.
Al Qaeda constitutes a stylized, fake and almost folkloric abstraction
of terrorism, which permeates the inner consciousness of millions of
people around the World.
Reference to Al Qaeda has become a dogma, a belief, which most people
espouse unconditionally.
Is this political indoctrination? Is it brain-washing? If so what is the
underlying objective?
People's capacity to independently analyze World events, as well as
address causal relationships pertaining to politics and society, is
significantly impaired. That is the objective!
The routine use of Al Qaeda to generate blanket explanations of complex
political events is meant to create confusion.
It prevents people from
thinking."
Chossudovsky's most important point is that
human consciousness is at stake.
The CIA, Mossad, MI6, and other intelligence
agencies around the world that have successfully invaded the global public
mind through covert information and psychological operations are waging a
war on the human mind. They are enemies of humanity, and enemies of human
evolution.
Thus, for humanity to evolve and prosper, the CIA, MI6, and Mossad must be
brought to justice.
Also,
the media companies that are cooperating
with these agencies
to suppress the truth about 9/11 and other evil events
must also be brought to justice. They are suppressing information that will
enlighten and awaken the people of the Western world to regain their
rightful power over their governments.
These evil intelligence agencies and media companies are holding back
humanity by brainwashing the global public with fear and lies. The education
and enlightenment of all members of the planet is necessary not just for the
prosperity of the species, but for its very survival.
There are informed people around the world who believe that the world is on
the verge of a nuclear world war, which will be triggered by an
American-Israeli attack on Iran within the next 12 months.
If such a tragic outcome comes to pass, we'll know who to blame:
the CIA, Mossad, MI6, the bangksters's
military-industrial complex, and the global mainstream media that has
systematically suppressed the truth about the 9/11 attacks and the real
reasons for
the Global War on Terrorism.
