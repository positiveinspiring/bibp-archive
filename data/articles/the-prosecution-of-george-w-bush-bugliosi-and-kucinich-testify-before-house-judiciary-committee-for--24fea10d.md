Inquiry Hearing on Articles of Impeachment
Former L.A. County Prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi and author of "The
Prosecution of George W. Bush For Murder", which details prosecutable
evidence of murder by George Bush and Dick Cheney and others.
George W Bush knew and purposely lied to America and mislead The Congress
about "Saddam Hussein NOT being an IMMINENT threat to the United States by
deleting that critical sentence in a declassified report (The White Papers)
by his own Intelligence Advisors in order to start the War with Iraq.
And the SAME PATTERN IS BEING PLAYED NOW regarding
IRAN.
This "President"
NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!
In his book, Bugliosi says he has irrefutable proof to convict both George W
Bush and Dick Cheney for 1st Degree Murder, a crime for which there is NO
Statute of Limitations. Bugliosi is best known for his successful 1970
prosecution of Charles Manson.
Main Stream Media is not covering this Historic Event, brought by the moving
papers of Articles of Impeachment, authored by Congressman Dennis Kucinich,
(D) Ohio and former presidential candidate.
CSPAN 1 is the only network covering this Hearing gavel to gavel.
