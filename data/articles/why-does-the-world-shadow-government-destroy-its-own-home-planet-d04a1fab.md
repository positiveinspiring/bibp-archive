Dont these people live on the same planet, work in the same world, and play on the same turf as the rest of us?! Dont they drink the same water, eat the same food, breathe the same air? Truly, the leaders of the World Shadow Government (WSG) have soiled their own nest in ways that are forever irremediable and irreversible. Sounds totally crazy, doesn't it? Thats because it is!
However, the question still remains...
Why? WHY?! WHY?!
If ever there was a 64,000 dollar question, THIS IS IT. Why would TPTW (The Powers That Were) destroy their own home ruin their own living environments spoil their own stretches of beautiful and pristine beaches, and mar their mountaintop enclaves.
Does acid rain somehow avoid their hidden chalets? Do oil spills decide not to wash up on their private shorelines? Do the different vectors of dissemination of radioactivity conveniently discriminate in their favor?
Does acid rain somehow avoid their hidden chalets?
Do oil spills decide not to wash up on their private shorelines?
Do the different vectors of dissemination of radioactivity conveniently discriminate in their favor?
If there is one question which permeates every nook and cranny of the alternative internet culture and is asked more than any other, this is the one in 2012.
Why do those who populate the peak of the New World Order hierarchy pursue an agenda of relentless planetary destruction? There are three primary reasons why the World Shadow Government has permitted the unmitigated and ongoing destruction of the planetary environment on every level in every sphere of life on every continent in every ocean.
There are in fact more than just these 3 reasons, but these are the prime movers. These are the underlying, overarching explanations, which simply cannot be refuted. For those who want the short story, it is as follows:
End-Time Madness prevails around the world during the end of the Kali Yuga The Kali Yuga is always known for a proliferation of mind-altering drugs and chemicals coupled with genetic mutation and years of inbreeding among the ruling families. The end days of Kali Yuga are always defined by technospheric breakdown, environmental destruction and societal degeneration
End-Time Madness prevails around the world during the end of the Kali Yuga
The Kali Yuga is always known for a proliferation of mind-altering drugs and chemicals coupled with genetic mutation and years of inbreeding among the ruling families.
The end days of Kali Yuga are always defined by technospheric breakdown, environmental destruction and societal degeneration
How do these three statements inform the previously stated fact of life on Planet Earth in 2012?
That those who reside at the pinnacle of worldly power have clearly allowed, and even encouraged, the systematic destruction of the entire earth realm.
I. End-Time Madness
...prevails around the world during the end of the Kali Yuga Those who operate at the peak of the Global Control Matrix (GCM) are subject to all the same daily influences that you and we are.
They suffer the same ailments, eat the same food, and grow old in the same ways. Since they are vulnerable to the same environmental risks and dangers, health-undermining co-factors and variables of living life in the 3rd density as the rest of us, they do get sick just like everyone else. The many life-threatening diseases and chronic illnesses, which abound throughout the world, are not safely avoided by them. In fact, the stresses that exist at their level of planetary administration are many and diverse. The pressure is pretty darn high all the time.
When youre so challenged mentally, emotionally, psychologically and spiritually, and youre in the driver seat within the GCM, you can imagine the degree of stress. No, you really cant. Were talking LOTS of stress, which always serves as the number one trigger for all that ails us here on earth. Whats the point?
Once these folks are captured by their fancy version of the healthcare system, their physical health and mental faculties will deteriorate. Just as the rest of society experiences physical degradation after being regularly exposed to the health- destroying toxicities associated with the medical-pharmaceutical complex. Because they do have privileged access to the best and the brightest throughout science and medicine, they are vulnerable to all of the flawed approaches that the best science/medicine can buy. The same medical complex, which has forever captured them, also has ways of ensuring that no one ever leaves the reservation, especially at their level of involvement.
Therefore, you can imagine how being locked in for life can feel rather suffocating, particularly for those who have a more refined code of ethics and are independent thinkers. When one is born into the upper echelons of the GCM or WSG, and nothing but your last name keeps you imprisoned in such a system of leadership over global management and control, the experience will inevitably become oppressive. And so it does! To the point where each individual is trapped in a crucible of sorts which has its own set of trials and tribulations.
Of course, these positions also come with awesome perqs which are illusory at best, personally destructive at worst. The End of Kali Yuga: When the craziest among us are running the asylum How deeply do we have to explore this subject to adequately answer the question in the title? As we retrospectively view the history of the planet over the past 100, 1000 or 5000 years, we see a landscape littered with the ravages of war, conflict and awesome oppression. There are so many examples of mass murder and theft of resources on such a grand scale that one sometimes wonders if this place might be hell.
Of course, it is only a hell for those who created it and surely those who run the place have always played a major role in the tragedy side of life. But not without many of us acting as accomplices, wittingly or unwittingly. In any event, we only need to visit an oft-repeated definition for insanity to really understand who's been in charge of the realm for all these years.
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.
Sounds pretty familiar to us, as it looks very familiar throughout this new millennium, everywhere we look.
As follows:

These three lists are by no means exhaustive, but each is illustrative of just how much crazy mischief TPTW can make in a fairly short period of time.
This conduct, however, is exactly what were talking about when we say insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again. When will these controller types ever get with a new program? Perhaps not in our lifetime, theyve been in power for so long. We assume that you now more fully comprehend the notion of End-Time Madness. While it does come in many shapes and sizes, TPTW usually exhibit very similar symptoms which can be observed in their handiwork as listed above.
Hopefully we all agree that the behavior delineated above qualifies as full blown madness, clear cut insanity and downright craziness, whichever you prefer.
II. The Kali Yuga is always known
...for a proliferation of mind-altering drugs and chemicals
Environmental radioactivity and electro-pollution also pervade the global habitat. This status quo is coupled with an epidemic of genetic mutation, as well as inbreeding among the ruling class. In his book entitled While The Gods Play Alain Danielou perceptively pointed out the following dynamic that occurs throughout and especially at the end of the Kali Yuga:
When the gods wish to destroy a wicked tyrant, they inspire the madness in him to lose himself. Drugs are among their armaments. Their irrational and immoderate intrusion signals the imminent end of the species at the end of Kali Yuga.
With an ever-increasing exposure to myriad manmade chemicals, especially through the ingestion of countless pharmaceutical medications and synthetic food additives, we see a derangement of mind, body and soul which threatens the entire civilization.
Recreational drugs, such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, LSD, amphetamine, as well as the many new synthetic versions, have become a permanent fixture in our society.
All taken together, their aggregate use puts the entire order at great risk. The unbridled proliferation and use of chemicals throughout the entire civilization has likewise put the health and life of the global population in great danger. The human body was simply not designed to process and detoxify such a steady onslaught of chemical assaults. As these chemicals and compounds, pollutants and contaminants, toxins and poisons begin to bio-accumulate over generations, the gene pool becomes degraded, as the quality of life precipitously declines. Eventually, the people (especially the leaders) become so inundated with chemical exposures that their ability to respond to life and its challenges becomes short-circuited.
Three very significant and profound developments occur in the process of societal devolution.
Each of these inevitable outcomes applies particularly to those who staff the World Shadow Government.
The capacity to apply the faculty of reason begins to flee humankind Common sense becomes very rare and a thing of the past Irrationality and unreasonableness start to rule the day everywhere, all the time
The capacity to apply the faculty of reason begins to flee humankind
Common sense becomes very rare and a thing of the past
Irrationality and unreasonableness start to rule the day everywhere, all the time
As these three societal phenomena become amplified, the manifestations of their presence can hardly be overlooked.
Particularly when the masses are so easily influenced that they can be:
stampeded into war corralled into a drug culture compelled to tattoo their bodies convinced of the propriety of sexual perversions boxed into a thoroughly corrupt two-party political system persuaded to vote against their very own interest coerced to vaccinate their children on a regular basis forced into drinking fluoridated water transfixed by the TV - the ultimate weapon of mass deception duped into paying taxes to rogue, criminal governments defrauded out of their life savings and retirement accounts deceived into worshipping the Almighty Dollar, instead of an Almighty God
stampeded into war
corralled into a drug culture
compelled to tattoo their bodies
convinced of the propriety of sexual perversions
boxed into a thoroughly corrupt two-party political system
persuaded to vote against their very own interest
coerced to vaccinate their children on a regular basis
forced into drinking fluoridated water
transfixed by the TV - the ultimate weapon of mass deception
duped into paying taxes to rogue, criminal governments
defrauded out of their life savings and retirement accounts
deceived into worshipping the Almighty Dollar, instead of an Almighty God
Certainly the overlay of the Pharmaceutical Culture has gone a long way toward addicting and compromising every aspect of the human body and mind.
This whole process of taking over each person is a rather complicated plot and will be taken up in a future essay entitled: First They get Your Body; Then They Get Your Mind; Finally They Get Your Soul This upcoming essay will thoroughly elucidate the multi-decade plan to create a drug culture so entrenched that it functions, in and of itself, to ensure that the orders of the World Shadow Government are always carried out.
Willingly and without complaint is how a great majority of people go about their day, because of how they have been sufficiently anesthetized, desensitized and chemically lobotomized. For additional insight into this major co-factor, you may want to consult a previous article entitled: Global Population Explosion Marks The End Of The Iron Age.
III. The end days of Kali Yuga
...are always defined by technospheric breakdown, environmental destruction and societal degeneration This third and last answer to the question in the title is as causal in nature as it is an effect of the very nature of the Kali Yuga.
You see, the Kali Yuga is the final age of an epoch punctuated by this current Age of Quarrel (aka Kali Yuga). This grand epoch is composed of four yugas and includes the three yugas preceding the Kali Yuga.
Each of these progressively shorter yugas descends into times of greater chaos and disorder. Ultimately, the epoch reaches completion with the end of the Kali Yuga, culminating with the appearance of Lord Kalki. Yes, He has come and gone, and only a very few knew of his earthly incarnation. The obvious political anarchy, social pandemonium and economic/financial mayhem which exists everywhere around the globe is a reflection of this Age of Conflict. The longer the status quo is allowed to continue, and the more the global population increases, the greater the magnitude of problems on every front. Competition for scarcer resources coupled with unparalleled earth changes only serve to magnify the awesome challenges we face as a world community. More than ever, humankind is being compelled to live in harmony and peace to address these obstacles. Instead many are moving in the opposite direction. This is the result of mans inhumanity to man as witnessed throughout so much of todays civilization.
When the human race loses it ability to think and act rationally and ethically, what else could be expected. The inexorable densification of spirit and matter over the course of the Kali Yuga is designed to produce the hapless outcomes we see all around us. Given the densifying nature of the Iron Age (iron is much more dense than gold, as well as silver and bronze) the only possible scenarios are those which we have experienced since we took birth on this blue orb.
Just as the Golden Age of Satya Yuga was known for its cultural refinement and sublime spirituality, our current Age of Iron is now famous for popularizing that which is truly coarse, crude and crass. The longer these societal qualities persist, the more the civilization will degenerate into outright cruelty devoid of compassion. And so it has. How does this relate to technospheric breakdown and environmental destruction?
Social degeneration inevitably sets the stage for the degradation of the planetary environment. Likewise, lack of conscience and unsound science will guarantee an eventual technospheric breakdown. The pervasive lack of respect for life and planet will always devolve into wanton environmental devastation and the consequential ecological apocalypse.
Technospheric breakdown is of course also the product of perceived existential threats to the human race, and the many defective scientific endeavors pursued and technological innovations implemented to address them. Desperation to live at all costs, in the face of insurmountable challenges, will always drive the left brain, linear-oriented, egocentric mind to try and do anything possible to survive. This attitude has produced numerous technological developments and industrial enterprises which are profoundly and fundamentally deficient.
Whereas most of the foundational paradigms throughout modern civilization are inherently flawed, each contains the seeds of its own destruction.
One need only review the disasters directly resulting from the Nuclear Energy Paradigm to grasp this critical point. A glimpse into the planetary consequences of the Hydrocarbon Fuel Paradigm will likewise reveal the unfolding technospheric breakdown within that realm of operation. Yes, but how does all this relate to the WSG?
THEY do have access to all the information that LOTS of money can buy. THEY control the observatories and laboratories alike. Every university and research institution operates under THEIR umbrella with the exception of a very few. Therefore, THEY have access to a tremendous amount of empirical data and authoritative information which tells the true state of the planet and solar system. For instance, THEY know exactly where Planet Earth is relative to rapidly escalating Global Climate Change. THEY know all about the never-seen-before changes within the earths core. TPTW are aware of the many consequential astrological alignments which have been stacking up, and what kind of societal cataclysms to expect. THEY are fully cognizant of the power of the internet and how it has awakened many to their (TPTW) multi-millennial agenda.

Something to consider
If you were in their shoes right now, what would you do? What could you do?!
All of the financial schemes and political plots are in full cyberspace view. Much of what anyone might want to know about how we ever got into this global condition is already plastered all over a world wide web. The proverbial cat is out of the bag, never to be re-bagged. What might we expect in light of their (WSG) previous history and future expectations for massive planetary transformation?
Well, heres their MO going forward. It revolves around one very practical matter where it concerns their running of the world. They seek to create their own version of order out of chaos, which is all theyve ever done for thousands of years.
Also, as previously discussed, they are quite proficient at doing the very same thing over and over with catastrophic results (aka insanity). Furthermore, one thing they are not and that is clueless about just what would happen if everyone knew what they know. They have never been about sharing the truth or disseminating the facts regarding anything. Its just not in their blood to do so. But much more significantly for themselves, they do know what would transpire all across the planet should the common man/woman become acquainted with certain eventualities. Please bear in mind that their supreme management goal has always been about control. Thats why we call it the Global Control Matrix. Ergo, the last thing TPTW wants to deal with, particularly during a predictably tumultuous end-time scenario, is uncontrollable chaos. Truly, it is visceral and widespread panic which they always seek to prevent.
This has driven their agenda from time immemorial, just as it has driven them crazy.
Question For The Reader
If you were the top boss and knew everything that they know, would you use the worldwide media to inform the masses about the true state of affairs?
Its actually an unfair question since you dont have a hint concerning some of the most grave and formidable obstacles facing the human race. The real serious stuff is always hidden under the cover of all the apparently bad news you see on the front pages and evening news.
From our seat, we do not in any way justify their actions. However, we do understand the pickle they are in, especially as we approach the end of the Kali Yuga.
Also, we are well aware that they cannot proceed with any plan or course of action unless allowed to do so by the Highest Power - spiritual power, that is.
Macrocosmic Perspective
The good news here is that the Kali Yuga is always manifesting according to the destiny of each individual as it manifests according to the destiny of each nation and every other earthbound collective.
Nothing can go wrong here, or at any time. What we are experiencing 24/7 is but a never-ending sport of Consciousness. Karma, and in some cases instant karma, is coming at us fast and furiously during the end-time.
And the WSG is merely the instrument of the outworking of that karma, especially that which manifests as the destiny of nations. (i.e. The WSG is not destroying the planet, Kali is. The WSG is simply the unwitting instrument by which all things shall come to pass at the end of Kali* Yuga.)
* Kali, the Goddess of Hindu spirituality is also known as the Destroyer of false consciousness.
Sometimes this play is a comedy, other times a tragedy; nevertheless, each act, each performance contains its own perfection.
The lessons which can be learned throughout the Kali Yuga can only be learned during a Kali Yuga. Just as life during the Golden Age offered the perfect setting for those souls who needed to receive the experience of a golden age. The Bronze Age preceding our current era was also defined by a gradual degeneration of the natural order and declining adherence to scriptural truths.
Which is exactly what every soul incarnation experienced during the Dwapara Yuga (aka the Bronze Age). Every civilization sits on an undergirding philosophical foundation of sorts. Therefore, the extent to which the integral systems of philosophy, religious paradigms, and schools of spirituality are unsound will be reflected in all the institutions and structures which society builds. Likewise, the degree to which those institutional blueprints are inherently flawed will also show up in the functioning, or rather dysfunctioning, of the society. When the foundations are laid by individuals whose thinking is skewed toward self-interest or is fear-based, we see the results all around us.
Conversely, when the necessary systems and institutions are constructed on the basis of egocentricity, instead of respect for all life and reverence for the immanent Divine, we again can plainly see the consequences. Hopefully, you can now better apprehend the various subtleties and nuances around the answers to the question:
Why does the World Shadow Government permit the ruination of its own living environment?
Authors Note
Conspicuously absent from this WSG revelation is the obvious inevitability of things to occur on Planet Earth by virtue of paths chosen at the outset of the Industrial Revolution.
Unknown to many, the Industrial Revolution (IR) was completely engineered by the WSG. It exerted as much control then as it does today; albeit in a much broader and more sophisticated way in 2012. The decisions taken at the inception of the industrialization of the world set the stage for all that we experience today.
In other words, once the Oil & Gas Industry was given its place of prominence to fuel this worldwide enterprise (IR), the global infrastructure and superstructure were constructed to accommodate that decision. Hence, the Hydrocarbon Fuel Paradigm is now the predominant energy source across the planet.
In light of this reality, what can be done at this late date to free the planet from such a destructive energy paradigm? Particularly in the midst of a global economic depression, such a necessary transition away from oil and gas would surely deal a death blow to all the fragile economies that rely on petrodollar revenues.
The WSG knows this of course, and also relies on the very same revenues to grease many of their many covert operations.
This same assessment is applicable to the Nuclear Fuel Paradigm, as well as other basic societal paradigms. Many of these other paths to which the WSG overly committed the civilization also cannot be undone without tremendous hardship and sacrifices for every resident of Planet Earth.
Now many are saying lets just transition to free energy, and we say go for it. Everywhere it can be done, just make it happen.
Getting off their energy grid - forever - is certainly the best and quickest way to take back our power individually and collectively literally and figuratively.
Compelling Anecdotal Evidence
The BP Gulf oil spill was a defining moment throughout the current and unprecedented revelatory period of how the WSG actually works.
Many of us worked on the remediation of the Gulf and we were shocked to see the apathy and lack of involvement on the part of the rich and famous who own extensive beachfront real estate and expensive mansions along the entire coastline of Florida.
Bear in mind that the stretch of shoreline from Stuart to Miami is considered by insiders to be the stomping grounds for many of the worlds richest and most influential power families. And yet their response was mute throughout the course of the spill, as it is up to this very day.
In the end, many of us determined that the coordinated BP and US Government response to this oil spill disaster was taken at the behest of these very same powerbrokers who basically own the peninsula of Florida. Theyre all about the pharmaceutical culture, so why not just disappear the oil with Corexit. That way it wont wash up on the beaches and bring down the property values. Nor will it foul the waters on the surface with slicks.
Again, just sink the oil no matter that it will kill off the marine life; just as long as it doesn't show up on the beach or on the hulls of the fancy yachts parked in the marinas up and down the coast of Florida.
Never have the intentions and modus operandi of the WSG been so transparent with regard to grave environmental concerns than during the BP oil spill.
Owning a $45 million island home off the coast of Miami in the middle of the largest oil spill in North American history becomes a radically altered investment, doesnt it?
Addendum
We did not take up the topics of genetic mutation or inbreeding among the ruling class because each is worthy of its own separate essay.
We all know what multi-generational inbreeding will cause to the progeny. The many ruling families of the plutocracy/oligarchy have been fastidious about keeping it all in the family for many centuries. This policy has been pursued with dire consequences to the mental, emotional and psychological health of entire bloodlines.
The physical and constitutional health has likewise suffered greatly.
Its therefore much easier to view their circumstances with understanding and compassion. Any one of us could have been born into any one of these Illuminati families. Actually, some of us were, and thats why they write and reveal this type of esoteric and long-kept secret information! As for the genetic mutation component of this story, its not difficult to comprehend how generations of under-the-radar genetic mutations and their subclinical symptomatology will eventually translate to fuzzy thinking and fuddled feelings. Among the masses, we see evidence everyday in the outpicturing of this hidden dynamic in the form of some wild and crazy behavior.
Therefore, it is quite easy to deduce that when the same phenomena occur throughout the WSG, all hell can break loose, at any time, in any place.
And so it does, with increasing regularity.
When a real big cog in a real big machine moves just a little, all the smaller cogs connected to it down the line are set off into their own frenzied orbits, sometimes spinning completely out of control for fear of what the biggest cog might do. Or not do.
