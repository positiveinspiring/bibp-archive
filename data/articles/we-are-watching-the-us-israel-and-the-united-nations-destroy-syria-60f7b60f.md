UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon
wrote in a letter to the UN Security
Council (UNSC) that the bombings in Syria have been mobilized and enacted by
established terrorist groups.
Ki-moon believes that al-Qaeda is responsible for the suicide bombings in
April that killed over 55 people, although there was no evidence cited.
Faisal Mukdad, the deputy Foreign
Minister and government spokesman remarked that the
rebels who are fighting
against Bashar al-Assad were criminals and drug dealers. Mukdad says it
was those rebels who escalated the attacks and the Syria has a right to
defend itself.
The election of al-Assad into power is a justification for the groups
continued assault on the Syrian nation.
Mukdad blames the US government and France for thwarting peace plans;
referring to French foreign minister Alain Juppes comment calling for
war.
He says,
This is what the West wants - extremist and
al-Qaeda forces controlling the whole region.
Mukdad maintains that terrorist factions have
caused the bombings and battles where civilians have been caught in the
cross fire.
While innocent Syrians are being killed by the
terrorist groups, the confusion as to their purpose mounts. They appear to
simply be agitators, directly cause violence so that there will be violence.
Although the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian regime agreed to peace,
as brokered by Annan, the UN Arab League special representative envoy to
Syria, reports coming from the most devastated areas say the opposite.
Later this week, the UNSC will discuss Ki-moons comments as well as hear a
report from Kofi Annan, international mediator for the UN. Annan will talk
about the violence in Syria before visiting the region and promote his
six-point peace plan.
The six point peace plan involves all parties withdrawing military presence,
weaponry from cities, installment of monitors (most likely from the UN), and
facilitate talks between the Syrian government and the resistance.
Annan hopes to ease Syria in a controlled political transition of power.
The Obama administration has grave doubts that Annans plan will come to
fruition; blaming Syrian President Bashar al-Assads lack of compliance to
the terms set forth by Annan. The mounting violence from the opposition also
is cited as proof that Annan cannot bring the fighting to an end.
Susan Rice, the US Ambassador to the UN has said that
NATO-backed
terrorists would perform more attacks unless President Bashar al-Assad
stepped down.
Rice stated:
The longer Assad clings to power, the
greater the risk of destabilization in Syria and throughout the region.
This threat, though subtle, is clearly asserting
that unless al-Assad steps down voluntarily, the attacks in Syria will
continue. The UNs NATO forces are attempted to seize control over Syria.
Rice added that:
Bombings also remind us of the urgent need
for a political solution in Syria before it is too late.
Hillary Clinton has also made comments
that not only are al-Qaeda terrorist groups stationed in Syria, they are
working with the US to assist in toppling the Syrian government.
Clinton states,
We have a very dangerous set of actors in
the region, Al-Qaeda, Hamas, and those who are on our terrorist list, to
be sure, supporting - claiming to support the opposition [in Syria].
Ban noted that parts of the city areas are
controlled by the resistance. The UN has plans to install an unarmed UN
observer team (UNSMIS) in Syria.
Ki-moon was disturbed by the increase in bombings in Syria, and said that:
The sophistication and size of the bombs
point to a high level of expertise, which may indicate the involvement
of established terrorist groups.
Ki-moon did not name who those established
terrorist groups are.
Obama himself has offered to arbitrate to usher Assads stepping down as
President of Syria. The goal is to satisfy the demands of the terrorist
groups plaguing the region to assure the violence stops.
The plan hinges on the
support of Russia, who has voiced strong opposition
to the regime change. Russia has disallowed the UNSC access and sanction
implementation against Assad.
While Russia deals with an internal uprising, their ability to protect Syria
may be compromised were the US and NATO to use military force to ensure
Assad is replaced.
The Russians now consider President Assad a
liability, said Dimitri K. Simes, a Russia expert and president of the
Center for the National Interest in Washington.
But Putin doesnt like having his clients
removed one after another by the United States, and he considers Assad
his client.
Dimitry Mededev, Prime Minister of Russia
and Obama spoke at length at the G8 Summit at Camp David about the situation
in Syria and Russias future involvement.
Recently Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu said that he is
sickened by the violence in Syria and places
full blame on Assad.
Support for Assads removal is gaining traction among world powers and
international bodies. The Gulf Cooperation Council and the European Union
also condemn Assad and call for a regime change.
In a press release, Netanyahu said:
Prime Minister [Binyamin] Netanyahu
expresses his revulsion over the ongoing massacre being perpetrated by
the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad against innocent civilians,
which continued over the weekend in Houla and included dozens of
innocent children.
Syria Under Attack by...
Globalist Death Squad Experts

As the destabilization effort against Syria continues, the connections
between the terrorist opposition forces and Anglo-American, pro-NATO
governments are becoming more and more obvious, even as the mainstream media
refuses to address the issue in any manner other than direct obfuscation.
Thankfully, a sizable portion of the alternative media, along with outspoken
Syrians like
YouTube blogger Syrian Girl have played a major role in
exposing the rebels for what they are - foreign terrorists and criminal
Syrian elements that are being backed by Anglo-American and pro-NATO
governments and intelligence agencies.
Many of these individuals are admittedly
al-Qaeda, much like the Libyan rebels who, after taking power with the
help of NATO, immediately began restricting freedoms and slaughtering black
Libyans. Indeed, a sizable portion of these terrorists have actually
traveled from Libya to Syria, with some working from across the borders of
Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon.
As author and historian, Webster Griffin Tarpley, has aptly stated
before, it is now widely apparent that al-Qaeda is nothing more than the
United States Arab legion.
In addition, due the increasing level of brazenness with which the
Anglo-American empires are engaging in their operations, the actual players
involved in the destabilization efforts are also becoming more visible as
well.
One individual who is receiving uncharacteristic levels of press attention
is Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria.
Of course, all of the reporting by the mainstream media is glowing and
supportive, making it seem as if Ford were a bona fide peoples hero
fighting for an oppressed population.
Yet the reality is that he is nothing more than a globalist destabilization
expert who is merely taking over from his mentor John Negroponte, who became
quite refined as a enabler of mass slaughter in Central America and Iraq.
Indeed, Negropontes Iraq affair is where Ford himself was able to hone his
skills in the arming and assistance of ruthless death squads who target
innocent people in campaigns of terror and mass murder.
Now, however, questions must arise over possible connections to
destabilization agents and potential participation in these efforts by
General Robert Mood, the Norwegian general which has recently been
appointed head of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS)
as well as the ever-present David Petraeus in the background.
First, however, some background might be necessary for those who are not
familiar with the connections between the prominent officials like Ford
and Negroponte and how they are relevant to the situation in Syria.
It should be noted that Prof. Michel Chossudovsky of
GlobalResearch.ca has provided an excellent historical presentation of the
connections of Negroponte, Ford, and Petraeus in relation to death squads
and destabilization in his article The
Pentagons Salvador Option: The Deployment of Death Squads in Iraq and
Syria.
I encourage everyone to read this excellent
piece for context and analysis as a companion to my own article.
John Negroponte was the U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985. In
this role, he was instrumental in supporting and overseeing the Nicaraguan
Contra killers who, although based in Honduras, engaged in horrific acts of
terrorism inside Nicaragua. Ultimately, this operation claimed the lives of
approximately 50,000 innocent civilians.
This is the origin of the term Salvador Option
when speaking of the formation of death squads for political purposes, an
option that has become a hallmark of Negroponte and the system which he
represents.
Negroponte was also responsible for the formation of the Honduran death
squads who engaged in a mission of terror against opponents of the US-backed
Honduran regime as well as the Sandinistas and civilian populations in
Nicaragua.
As Peter Roff and James Chapin write in their article
Face-off: Bushs Foreign Policy Warriors,
The Sun described the activities of a secret
CIA-trained Honduran army unit, Battalion 316, that used 'shock and
suffocation devices in interrogations. Prisoners often were kept naked
and, when no longer useful, killed and buried in unmarked graves.'
On August 27, 1997, CIA Inspector General Frederick P. Hitz released a
211-page classified report entitled Selected Issues Relating to CIA
Activities in Honduras in the 1980s. This report was partly
declassified on Oct. 22, 1998, in response to demands by the Honduran
human rights ombudsman.
In 2005, Negroponte was appointed as ambassador
to Iraq. In this role, he again oversaw the formation of death squads who
targeted both the civilian populations and the Iraqi insurgency.
The goal here was to foment division within the
insurgency and turn it into a fragmented front. A divided opposition is
obviously much easier to defeat than a united one. This theory has been
proven accurate time and time again.
Indeed, in 2005, a
story was leaked to Newsweek where the Pentagon confirmed
that it was,
considering forming hit squads of Kurdish
and Shia fighters to target leaders of the Iraqi insurgency in a
strategic shift borrowed from the American struggle against left-wing
guerrillas in Central America 20 years ago. [1]
The Pentagon did more than consider this
option. Not very long after this information was leaked, Iraq began to see
the results of its implementation.
As Dahr Jamail of Antiwar.com
wrote in 2007,
Under the 'Salvador Option,' Negroponte had
assistance from his colleague from his days in Central America during
the 1980s, Ret. Col James Steele.
Steele, whose title in Baghdad was Counselor
for Iraqi Security Forces supervised the selection and training of
members of the Badr Organization and Mehdi Army, the two largest Shi'ite
militias in Iraq, in order to target the leadership and support networks
of a primarily Sunni resistance.
Planned or not, these death squads promptly spiraled out of control to
become the leading cause of death in Iraq. Intentional or not, the
scores of tortured, mutilated bodies which turn up on the streets of
Baghdad each day are generated by the death squads whose impetus was
John Negroponte.
And it is this U.S.-backed sectarian
violence which largely led to the hell-disaster that Iraq is today.
Of course, the fact that the death squad option
was implemented so quickly after the release of the report suggests that the
mercenaries were being organized and applied long before Newsweek was made
aware of them.
Nevertheless, serving in Iraq at the same time that the death squads were
beginning to make their bloody mark on the cohesion of the insurgency, was
Robert Ford who, at the time, had been appointed political counselor
to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
Ford remained in this post from 2004-2006 where
he worked closely with Negroponte. He was also heavily involved in the
organization of the death squads. Ford was instrumental in helping make
contacts with these individuals as well as developing and maintaining
relations with them for other purposes such as continued and future terror
campaigns.
In fact, Ford was once described by Negroponte as one of these very
tireless people . . . who didnt mind putting on his flak jacket and helmet
and going out of the Green Zone to meet contacts. In short, Ford acted as a
foot soldier in death squad formation.
Attempting to summarize the death squad plan, Michael Hirsh and John Barry
of Newsweek wrote in 2005:
[O]ne Pentagon proposal would send Special
Forces teams to advise, support and possibly train Iraqi squads, most
likely hand-picked Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shiite militiamen, to
target Sunni insurgents and their sympathizers, even across the border
into Syria, according to military insiders familiar with the
discussions.
It remains unclear, however, whether this
would be a policy of assassination or so-called 'snatch' operations, in
which the targets are sent to secret facilities for interrogation. The
current thinking is that while U.S. Special Forces would lead operations
in, say, Syria, activities inside Iraq itself would be carried out by
Iraqi paramilitaries.
Commenting further on the Newsweek article, the
Times Online added,
Nor is it clear who would take
responsibility for such a program - the Pentagon or the Central
Intelligence Agency. Such covert operations have traditionally been run
by the CIA at arms length from the administration in power, giving US
officials the ability to deny knowledge of it. [2]
Although the focus of these articles revolve
around the question of CIA/Pentagon death squads in Iraq, it is important to
notice that, as far back as 2005, it was admitted that there were clear
plans to create, fund, and operate death squads in Syria.
Ford and Negroponte are not the only high-profile US officials in the
trenches of death squad development however.
General David Petraeus, now Director of the CIA,
established and subsequently assumed command of the Multi-National Security
Transition Command Iraq (MNSTC) under the auspices of training and equipping
the Iraqi army, police, and security forces. Petraeus personal command of
the MNSTC began in 2004, at virtually the same time Negroponte was appointed
ambassador.
In reality, MNSTC was not merely about training Iraqi forces, but about
establishing death squads. Indeed, it was a true counterinsurgency strategy
that was instrumental to the Iraqi Salvador Option employed by the
Pentagon and, likely, the CIA.
Although Petraeus is now Director of the CIA, his military connections are
no doubt intact. Indeed, relationships of this nature do not change with the
mere presentation of a new title on one operative or another. Likewise,
Robert Fords 2009 appointment as ambassador to Syria is merely the
insertion of yet another destabilization agent into the Syrian landscape.
Fords current action in Syria serves the exact same purpose as his presence
in Iraq only a few years previous. This time, however, it seems that Ford is
taking on a more central role in the affair. Indeed, many Syrians, if not
aware of the more sinister acts of Ford, are at least aware that he has been
instrumental in fomenting violent rebellion and negative Western public
opinion against the ruling government.
This is why Fords convoy was
attacked by
pro-government Syrians as he rode through town
meeting with his terrorist
pets.
Fords very presence in Syria has been nothing more than a
destabilization
tactic. Indeed, he has drawn quite a bit of international attention to
himself by traveling across the country at will, meeting with protestors
and turning terrorists into martyrs in the minds of the gullible Western
public.
Logically, by meeting with protestors one can read instigating
terrorism. The mainstream media, however, reports Fords terror
encouragement tour as a heroic act of solidarity with the people.
Eventually, after a succession of terror tours the Assad regime finally
slapped restrictions on Fords travel, requiring him not to leave the
boundaries of Damascus. However, Ford
openly disregarded those limitations
and brazenly began traveling all over Syria, meeting with his terrorist
brethren.
Of course, one should not forget that Petraeus, as CIA Director and a direct
connection and common denominator between U.S. military and NATO contacts,
is also a major player in the Syrian Salvador Option which is now taking
shape. The death squad strategy is largely useless without at least of one
these institutions, a relatively easy accomplish since, at the top of both,
the establishment merges to form the same shadow government.
Nevertheless, there is one more major player in the Syrian destabilization
that should be drawing some more attention for his potential role in the
early development of the Syrian death squads.
General Robert Mood, the Norwegian
general who is now the head of the United Nations Supervision Mission In
Syria (UNSMIS), is not without his own potential for connections to
destabilization efforts in Syria.
Ironically, Mood has extensive connections with NATO, the organization (by
virtue of its member nations) which is responsible for the Syrian
destabilization to begin with. So, as it stands, we now have NATO being sent
in to Syria to observe and report on the actions of NATO (the death squads).
One can already assume what observations will be
made to the general public in the coming days (or weeks).
It is worth noting that General Mood
holds a Masters Degree in Military
Studies from the U.S. Marine Corps. University as well as attending his own
countries Norwegian Army Staff College and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Defense College located in Rome - truly a citizen of the
world.
From 2008 to 2011, Mood was the Commander in Chief of the United Nations
Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), an organization whose stated purpose
is to provide a military command structure for UN peacekeeping functions in
the Middle East. Mood was also
Operations Officer for the Norwegian
Battalion of UNIFL (United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon) during the
1980s.
However, interestingly enough, Mood, in his position as Commander in Chief
of UNTSO, oversaw the various established groups of UN observers, some of
which were (and still are) located in Syria. One of those groups OGG
(Observer Group Golan) is split into two different substations with one of
those stations headquartered in Damascus (OGG - Damascus). Other outposts of
UNTSO are based in Israel, Lebanon (which borders Syria), and Egypt.
Moods position then, would put him squarely involved in Syria at the same
time as Robert Ford and presumably, David Petraeus via his personally
delegated presence. With that in mind, one must wonder what role Mood might
have had in the formation of the death squads being developed at the time.
Webster Tarpley alluded to this possibility
in
an interview conducted with PressTV when he said:
Any analysis that doesnt start with the
death squads and the role of [American diplomat John Dimitri] Negroponte
in Baghdad and then Robert Ford in Damascus I would actually ask [Head
of United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria, Major] General Robert
Mood if you were there from 2009 to 2011 in Damascus what did you know
about the formation of these death squads. That would be a really
interesting question.
The fact that the rebellion in Syria is
actually a NATO/Anglo-American/Arab puppet state fostered destabilization
effort is not debatable to anyone who has even a basic grasp of the events
now transpiring in the region.
Although it is taking much longer to do to Syria
what these same forces
accomplished in Libya, the game plan remains exactly
the same.
In fact, many of the players that
took part in the dismantling the Gaddafi
regime are now involved in the destruction of Assads government. The same
al-Qaeda terrorists that emerged in Libya have now traveled to Syria for
round two of imperial moves to establish puppet governments and reduce the
living standards of an entire nation.
The infamous Libyan rebel leader Belhaj is now reportedly
conducting operations in Syria as well.
Of course, all of these forces work with the direct aid of the
Anglo-Americans and the de facto world army known as NATO. It has even been
reported by Thierry Meyssan of the Voltaire Network that French agents
acting as mercenaries/death squad participants were captured by the Syrian
government early on in the rebellion.
All the while, the mainstream Western media
reported the events as peaceful protest and a grass-roots level organic
Syrian uprising against an oppressive regime.
In examining the behavior and writings of the world elite, it is abundantly
clear that Syria exists as the last stepping stone before war is launched
against Iran. It seems almost certain that the Assad regime must be replaced
by a puppet government more favorable to the Anglo-American imperial powers
or, at the very least, one that is incapable of resisting them.
While Syria has lasted much longer than its
counterparts Libya and Egypt, it is unlikely that it will be able to hold
out much longer, particularly with the acceptance of the UN observer
forces inside its borders and an ever-growing pro-war sentiment expressed by
Western governments.
If war is launched on Iran, whether by the Western powers or by Israel,
World War Three is likely to follow.
While the United States and hence the rest of
NATO will undoubtedly follow the footsteps of the mad dog of the Middle
East, Russia will likely take the opposing side. China and India are likely
to follow Russia. A direct clash of these world powers has the potential to
produce more destruction than the previous two world wars put together.
Although not the architects of the war, it is important that the names of
Negroponte, Ford, Petraeus, and Mood be remembered for posterity as
the
worker bees who facilitated it.
