The argument is won:
capitalism as an effective system to
organize society
and provide for human needs has expired.
The evidence is conclusive.
Trillions of dollars to kick-start the economy in the US and Europe may have
given an ephemeral lease of life to the financial class to spin the casino
wheel once again, but it is more apparent by the day that the tentative
recovery has spluttered to a standstill. Gridlocked by unprecedented
levels of personal and national debts, the engine of production the real
economy is in a state of rigor mortis.
This collapse has been a long time in the making.
Decades of easy credit was
up to now a way for the ruling class government, corporations, financial
institutions to let the majority of workers subsidize the chronic loss in
their livelihoods, which have been drained since the mid-1970s by the
oligarchys self-aggrandizement from wage cutting, regressive taxation and
public spending cuts.
The political class whether liberal or conservative,
right or left have facilitated this giant wealth-siphoning process.
However, the point is that the economic system is now objectively shown to
be moribund. And it is impossible for so-called mainstream politicians to
think of any other way of doing business. They are ideologically blind.
Recall former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers arrogant assertion:
There is no alternative.
Likewise, US President
Barack Obama insists on
throwing billions more dollars at the banks and financiers on Wall Street.
But that wont kick-start an economy in which millions of workers are without
jobs and homes or who are on crumby wages and up to their necks in debt.
The
profit system has hit an historic dead-end and this gridlock is a result of
deep trends to do with the decline in capitalism as a mode of social
production (falling wages and profits and the concomitant explosion in
financial speculation and debts).
Widespread poverty and human misery is now seen on a massive scale in the
so-called developed world. Some 40 million Americans, for example, are
subsisting on food stamps.
The distinction between developed and
developing economies (always a myth anyway) is blurred. The ranks of the
worlds long-suffering poor are swelled with dispossessed blue and
white-collar workers and their families from across the US and Europe.
Together more than ever, they stand shut out from those gated havens of
obscene wealth for a global minority.
Similar historic junctures have been witnessed before when capitalism
floundered from its inexorable tendency to make the rich richer and the poor
poorer. Disturbingly, the release valve for the system and its bankruptcy
has always been war. Death and destruction is the lender of last resort to
an economic system that despite itself inevitably polarizes wealth to an
unworkable degree.
The First and Second World Wars claiming more than 70
million over a period of less than 10 years lives were effectively the
ultimate, grotesque bailouts.
In our time, war, it seems, has already begun.
The US oligarchy and its NATO
allies are waging a veritable war on the world:
killing, disappearing and
incarcerating millions of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan a
war that is expanding into Yemen, Somalia and the rest of the Horn of
Africa, with the militarization of sea lanes and oceans (see
Chossudovsky) and the setting up of forward projecting military
and missile bases in every continent (see
Rozoff).
On top of ordinary
poverty and misery, the world is truly seeing another historic descent into
barbarism.
Given this war-mongering dynamic, the growing US antagonism with
Iran, Russia and China is far from an idle threat. It is the logical next
step for a deeply illogical economic system.
But history is not inevitable. We are not necessarily programmed to repeat
its horrors.
A combination of
global communications among citizens and
political and social
consciousness may be enough to prevent a military
conflagration and overthrow the misrule of the oligarchy.
What is needed is:
-
a widening of the recognition that capitalism as a system of social
production is finished
-
the case has to be confidently made that an
alternative is very possible
That alternative is socialism (the subject of
a further article). To those who remain skeptical, they should bear in mind
the stark choice that Rosa Luxemberg foresaw for humanity: that is,
socialism or barbarism.
And we already have the latter.
