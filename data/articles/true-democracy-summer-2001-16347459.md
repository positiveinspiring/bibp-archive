Sandia National Laboritories (SNL)
When doing a search on my default search engine, one item stated "Microelectronics
and Photonics at Sandia. Content is not to be used in publications, presentations,
or commercial endeavors without permission. Please address comments to memsinfo@http://www.mdl.sandia.gov
Sandia compiles 1,000 technical documents per year for the U.S. Department
of Energy. Many are "available to the public." It's clickable by going
to their Web site which is http://mems.sandia.gov/scripts/index.asp and scrolling
down to the bottom and clicking on Questions and Comments.
If you refer back to what Dr. Boylan stated on this company, you will see
that there is nothing. This is due to the fact that they are concealing information
which they don't want us to know.
If I had asked their permission to publish this for you to read, they would
not have granted it any more than mainstream newspapers have granted me permission.
Since we know what the Department of Energy represents which is part of the
Shadow Government and this is listed as part of the Shadow Governmemt, we
need to demand that no funding be granted unless they open up their facility
to all people because it's clear that they don't want you to know what they
are engaged in doing.
