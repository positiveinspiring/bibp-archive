Vincent Harlow once wisely observed,
"Mens minds indeed conceive new thoughts
and plan new projects,
but out of ancient thinking and under
potent influence of long-established characteristics."
This has been reflected in reality for
both the positive but also for the negative.
A
critical modern-day "negative" that is threatening humanity as we know it is
the emergence of an increasingly transparent "neo-imperialist"
order that is currently subverting the world and seeking to
control the destiny of humanity in manners not unlike to what imperialism
has done throughout the ages.
This
"empire", unlike previous ones, is not serving the interest of a specific
country or nationality but an
international cabal of corporate-financier, self-proclaimed "globalist"
elite operating from the Wall Street-London axis of power along
with,
A
false political theater has been crafted by the corporate media serving as
the public relations arm of this agenda.
It is
about time people escaped the media "matrix" marketing a singular agenda
under different political labels and it is time to understand the
international gambles this empire is playing with our collective destiny.
The Nature of the Empire
Contrary to misconceptions by many
well-intentioned and aware people, this empire is not strictly
an "American
empire" in the sense that it is being done for the mere glory of America as
a nation although the historical Anglo-American political and financial
center of power is the driving factor.
Rather, it is an empire that seeks the
subversion of both the American people and the world by the creation of an
international corporatist order where power is centralized in hands of a
collective, privileged few expanding their control through the means of
co-opted governments and force.
The mechanisms of this modern empire are
parallel to the mechanism of the British Empire historically and can be
demonstrated in various sources of both scholarly and general analysis.
The parallel is found in manners such as the
function of empires in general (albeit under different historical contexts),
the role of "system administrators", and also the manner in which the
modern-day "empire" can be dismantled similar to the British Empires
dismantling from the American colonies, all of which will be noted.
What cannot be understated is the role of this
empire as an international corporatist order.
Michael Snyder
defines a corporatist order as one where:
Most wealth and power is concentrated in the
hands of giant corporations and big government is used as a tool by
these corporations to consolidate wealth and power even further. In a
corporatist system, the wealth and power of individuals and small
businesses is dwarfed by the overwhelming dominance of the corporations.
In this Snyders excellent article "Corporatism
Is Not Capitalism" discusses everything that is wrong with the system
including an increasing wealth disparity perpetuated by the disingenuous
means in which corporations conduct themselves in the global economy and the
concentration of undue wealth and power into the corporations collective
system through dubious means of manipulation.
Also mentioned is a University of Zurich study
demonstrating that a handful of 147 corporations which interlock with
various other corporate fronts own 40% of the worlds wealth among which
were the American megabanks,
-
Barclay
-
Morgan Stanley
-
JP Morgan Chase and Co.
-
Bank of America
-
Wells Fargo
-
Goldman Sachs
Those who have followed the workings of this
collective group would note how these individuals at the highest level of
the pyramid are the chief architects of human misery with their
financing of various think-tanks and fronts
to articulate their agenda and enforce it globally.
In my recent article, "High
Finance, Geopolitical Leverage, and the Rise of the New World Order", I
detailed the specifics in how high finance exploits ideologies from across
the political spectrum to hammer together a structure of control wherever it
convenient to do so.
I also examined the historical manner in which
this was done in the creation of
the Federal Reserve as well as the
historical role of international communism in serving high finances
geopolitical ambitions of creating "captive economies" as Dr. Anthony Sutton
explains:
Regardless of whatever political tool is
manipulated and spun in the modern political theater,
a single agenda marches forward.
The Function of the
Empire
The function of an empire is often reduced in
the minds of the general population to simply the military force which
serves as the muscle of the empire but this is often done at the expense of
neglecting the underlying "skeleton", namely the role of financial
administrators, networks, and interests.
In the case of the British Empire, these
networks worked in London to ensure the flow of money and resources into the
hands of the financial elite.
This was done by various methods such as the
tightly-controlled
mercantilist economic system that existed during the American colonial
era which was specifically set up to ensure British dominance over American
resources and prevent competition at the expense of individuals.
British imperial economic networks on the global
stage, especially in Asia, would often work in tandem with military power
such as in the strategy of "gunboat
diplomacy" where the empire would place gunboats off the coast of a
capital and threaten bombardment if certain economic concessions were not
made as was the case of the Bowring Treaty of 1855 with Thailand.
The
Bowring Treaty is presently credited by historians as spurring the
industrialization and modernization of Thailands economy, including greater
economic liberties.
However, it was a geopolitically unfair treaty
in the sense that it was coerced by the neighboring British military might
stationed in India and for the benefit of the expansion of British financial
hegemony.
The treaty stipulated, among other points both
positive and negative that,
"The import duty was fixed
at 3 percent for all articles, with two exceptions: opium was to be free
of duty, but it had to be sold to the opium farmer; and bullion was to
be free of duty."
One can see how this would have bolstered
Britains financial ambitions of competition in the region and one of the
most disingenuous provisions was the opium stipulation, considering the
previous "First
Opium War" in China and the British means to capitalize on opium
addiction for maximizing their profits.
Industrialization and modernization is not
always the byproduct of western ambitions in the third world.
In the case of
Thailand, industrialization occurred because of capital investment by the
west which built up Thailand but for the benefit of western hegemony and
Thailand was able to be kept "under control" by western military might to
prevent it becoming a rival.
However, the new "modus operandi" has become to
PREVENT the industrialization of the third world so as to not provide an
alternative center for economic power and geopolitical competition,
something China and Russia are currently being noted as doing,
hence slated for western subversion.
The primary center of focus in this has become
Africa and with Chinese and Russian interests seeking bilateral economic
agreements with various nations in Africa, by implication leading into
development and productivity outside the orbits of the Wall Street/London
casino economy establishment, Africa has become a
prime target of western destabilization to leverage
development into their hands and prevent it all together.
Libyas Gaddafi was leading
various initiatives to build up and strengthen Africa though investment,
trade, and constructing national institutions which were seen as rivals to
western interests, hence his removal through the premeditated, so-called
"humanitarian"-war in 2011 (see "The
Top Ten Myths in the War Against Libya").
Gaddafi was working to modernize Africa and make
it self-sufficient and his "economic crimes" in the eyes of the west,
including the,
...is what led to him being slated for western-assisted overthrow.
Amidst the violence and civil war the ravaged
the country,
peaceful negotiations were purposely thwarted in violation of the
"Responsibility to Protect" in order to further western geopolitical
designs.
The Libyan war was a western psy-op
30 years in the making.
Former Science advisor to the White House Dr.
John P. Holdren and current advisor Dr. Paul Ehrlich not only
openly call for a "planetary regime" and global government in their book "Ecoscience"
but openly express their contempt of the industrialization of the third
world, justifying it through pseudo-science premised on false
environmentalist concern.
They openly state their pro-sterilization,
pro-eugenics "Malthusian" outlook on society and slander those who view
science and technology as the key to solving humanitys problems (see
Dr. Webster Tarpleys below video expos√©).
Industrialization is not their goal but rather
industrialization within their interests where only they can control
development and the third world becoming an impoverished heap to be
exploited as feudal lands for high finance and western hegemony.
This
function of empire, fomenting geopolitical conflicts to expand regional
hegemony, had a precedent in diamond-rich "Zululand" in southern Africa
whose subversion in the "Anglo-Zulu
War" of 1879 was a landmark victory for imperialism in Africa.
The
British had been following a "forward policy" in what is now South Africa to
bring various regions, including Dutch Boer settlements, under their
consolidate control.
The
independent, self-sufficient and powerful Zulu kingdom was seen as a threat,
leading to an invasion in Zululand which would end up being deliberately
carved into 14 proxy states and its resources exploited.
The
British would take care to maintain rivalries in Zululand in order to
prevent a unified Zulu opposition to British control which was the primary
reason for the division.
"Divide and conquer" politics as seen in
Zululand is not unlike the manner in which British colonists in North
America during the 17th and 18th centuries would also cultivate and exploit
rivalries between Native American tribes in order to capitalize on the slave
and deerskin trade and maintain their domination politically and
economically (Tindall
88-89).
Nor is it unlike the current "foreign policy
blunders" and civil wars purposely orchestrated and capitalized on by NATO
in order to justify continued military occupation and geopolitical
leveraging for specific hegemonic goals from Libya to Central Asia.
Central Asia, Pipeline
Politics, and the "Grand Chessboard"
Similar "gunboat diplomacy" and "divide and
conquer" politics would reemerge with the current actions of the modern-day
imperialists of
militarized corporatism targeting nations that have resisted their plans
for global integration such as Iraq and Libya.
False pre-texts were invented to invade Iraq by the same interests in
order to commence its plundering. Iraqs economy would end up being
"reformed" according to a blueprint drawn up by a Council on Foreign
Relations (CFR) fellow Paul Bremer that amounted the absorption of its
economy into the global corporatist system along with stipulations
architected by the IMF.
The
Economist noted this with their intentions transparent in the title, "Lets
all go to the yard sale - If it all works out, Iraq will be a capitalists
dream", where it is noted that Iraqs economy was opened up to
multinational exploitation including the provisions of,
"100% ownership of Iraqi assets, full
repatriation of profits, equal legal standing with local firms, and
foreign banks being allowed to operate or buy into local banks".
Under the guise of this being a "capitalist"
venture (as opposed to the more proper term "corporatist"), the Economist
attempted to justify the foreign usurpation of Iraqi sovereignty and the
plundering and dictation of their resources according to western interests.
Iraqs purpose is not to be underestimated as it
is a significant lynchpin in the geopolitical endeavors of western hegemony
in central Asia and in geopolitically strangling Irans opposition to
western designs across the Middle East with US allies Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
and Israel as the primary beneficiaries.
Renowned analysts and journalists like
Pepe Escobar have noted the vital role natural gas
has in regional
geopolitics, especially with regards to the emerging "Shiite crescent"
and the proposed Syria-Iraq-Iran pipeline. This pipelines construction
would offset western/NATO aligned Saudi-Qatari-Israeli-Turkish gas
initiatives in the region.
The U.S. invasion of Iraq was initially intended
to install a viable western proxy but regional designs for western interests
have been increasingly faltering as the current Iraqi PM Nouri Al-Maliki
moves closer into the Iranian economic orbit.
The term "Shiite crescent" itself is a
sectarian-motivated term coined in the west and aimed at bolstering in the
mind of the population a premeditated divide between Sunni and Shiite
Muslims to further western geopolitical objectives in Syria and beyond.
This drive for hegemony is not merely conjecture
or "conspiracy theory" as this geopolitical point is admitted by
Zbigniew Brezinzski, the former National Security Advisor
under President James Carter
who organized the Afghanistan mujahidin in the 1980s.
He clearly enumerates in his book,
The Grand Chessboard,
the American geostrategic doctrine of perpetuating global supremacy and
pre-eminence by dominating central Asia and its vital resource and
logistical center.
Central Asia is seen as the grand chessboard
upon which U.S. global domination would be established. Especially noted in
the disingenuous book is central Asias global value in terms of natural
resources, economic activity and population.
According to Brzezinski, the person who could
dominate central Asia can claim global hegemony.
While he has supposedly
"sharply criticized Bushs foreign policy", he nonetheless architected the
very policy points that Bushs policy would serve with the invasion and
occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. The
war on terror was a bloody and exploitative
fraud for all involved.
Brzezinskis vision beholds a unipolar world
order dictated by one center of economic, political, and military power as
opposed to the vision of a multipolar world order of global collaboration as
envisioned by Russias Vladimir Putin at the 43rd Munich Security Conference in 2007:
Recently emerging supranational economic blocs
operating outside the Wall Street/London consensus such as
BRICS and the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization has begun to offer a viable counterbalance
to the west/NATOs global preeminence and empowering regional players to
become economic competitors instead of pawns for western corporate
interests.
The Men Behind the
Curtain
It must be noted that "global American
pre-eminence" is not a strictly "American" venture or ideal.
Rather it is the collective manifestation of the
special-interests and agendas of the corporate-overlords who have hijacked
and dominated Americas economy, political system, and media.
While this is not a popular concept in the
establishments halls of academia and politics, this did not stop
MSNBCs Dylan Ratigan from making
the following statement in 2008:
The biggest contributor to Barack Obamas
presidential campaign is Goldman Sachs [also a heavy contributor to
Republican candidates].
The primary activities of this president
relative to banking have been to protect the most lucrative aspect of
that business, which is the dark market for credit default swaps and the
like. That has been the explicit agenda of his Treasury Secretary.
This president is advocating trade
agreements that allow enhanced bank secrecy in Panama, enhanced
murdering of union members in Colombia, and the refunding of North
Korean slaves
But I guess where I take issue is, this
president is working for the bad guys.
The Democrats are working for the
bad guys. So are the Republicans. The Democrats get away with it by
saying, Look at how crazy the Republicans are; and the Democrats
pretend to care about people.
BUT THE FACT IS THE 2-PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM
IS UTTERLY BOGUS.
The two-party system
is indeed UTTERLY BOGUS.
Americas foreign and economic policies, while
fed to the public under the cover of presidential administrations, are
actually the byproducts of
US foreign policy think-tanks
funded by corporate-financier interests in
order to perpetuate their collective agenda which politicians merely
rubber-stamp into law.
Prominent think-tanks include,
Other groups include the RAND Corporation and
the not-to be-neglected Brookings Institute within whose halls,
according to Tony Cartalucci, can be found the blueprints for most
prominent international conflicts for the last 30 years.
Many prominent U.S. politicians from across the
artificial political lines are affiliated with these groups.
Dick Cheney (a former director - above video),
Hillary Clinton (below video), and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (who also
served on numerous boards of directors
including Chevron) among other politicians are Council on Foreign
Relations (CFR) members along with most self-serving US politicians.
A list of the CFRs corporate-financiers can be
found here.
Former CIA analyst and National Security Council
member Kenneth Pollack is a Brookings Institute member. A simple
visit to these think-tanks websites can be very insightful with regards to
whos funding who and who is doing what.
None of this is cryptic, "top secret knowledge"
but is simply the prevailing reality that can be easily verified with a
search engine by those who know what to look for. Follow the money...
The Iranian and Syrian
Dilemmas
The Brookings Institute is of particular concern
among these think-tanks as it has been the primary facilitator in the drive
for war against Iran founded on distortion and geopolitically-motivated
propaganda.
Much commotion has been recently circulating in
the media about the Iranian nuclear negotiations and the leader of
Hezbollah,
Hassan Nasrallah, best captured the reality by emphasizing the
significance of these negotiations and pointing out that the only other
alternative would be war.
He alleged that Israels Netanyahu was acting as
a representative for dubious Arab regimes, implying
western puppet-states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and stated that there was
a deliberate attempt to see no solution reached for reasons that will become
apparent.
Contrary to media reports portraying Iran as an
immediate, existential threat to US and Israeli security, the
Brookings Institute released a policy report in 2009 that was basically
a blueprint for overthrowing nations, in this case specifically for Iran,
titled
'Which Path to Persia?'
It was written by six prominent analysts within
establishment circles, including
Kenneth Pollack, admitting that Iran poses not a threat to the survival
of the United States and Israels security but their collective regional and
geopolitical hegemony and interests across the region.
It was noted that Iran was playing a strategy of
firmness and even aggressiveness but not recklessness in combating western
hegemony and imperialism as can be seen in its recent economic endeavors in
the
pipeline and gas politics of the region.
It was also noted that Iran was deliberately
avoiding a conflagration with the west and that any possible nuclear weapons
capability for Iran (which is noted as unconfirmed and nonexistent in other
reports) would be used as a deterrence for attack and protecting regional
ambitions Iran has for the region as opposed to the propaganda of using such
weapons to attack the U.S. and to "wipe Israel off the map" (pg. 24-25).
This is reconfirmed by the recent 2013
RAND Corporation report Iran After the Bomb which, while noting that no
evidence exists that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons according to the US
intelligence community, envisions a post-nuclear scenario of Iran.
RAND is another "globalist" think-tank that
hosts compromised interests but manages to give an honest synopsis of the
Iranian reality. It is also noted that Irans "supreme leader" Ayatollah
Khamenei has issued religious decrees labeling nuclear weapons as "against
Islamic principles."
Contrary to recent reports circulation by MEMRI
TV and mainstream media, these fatwas are not fake and actually
do exist. And contrary to some
critics, they are
not an example of taqiyya (deception).
One thing that is very revealing is the
following statement by RAND which sums up their insightful report:
The Islamic Republic [of Iran] is a
revisionist state that seeks to undermine what it perceives to be the
American-dominated order in the Middle East.
However, it does not have territorial
ambitions and does not seek to invade, conquer, or occupy other nations.
Its chief military aim is to deter a U.S. and/or Israeli military attack
while it undermines American allies in the Middle East [which includes
the economic interests of the totalitarian kingdoms of Saudi Arabia and
Qatar whose atrocities in human rights dwarfs anything Iran is guilty
of]
Irans possession of nuclear weapons will lead to greater tension
between the Shia theocracy and the conservative Sunni monarchies [Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, etc.]
However, Iran is unlikely to use nuclear
weapons against other Muslim countries
The Islamic Republic views Israel in
ideological terms. However, it is very unlikely that Iran would use
nuclear weapons against Israel, given the latters overwhelming
conventional and nuclear military superiority. (pg. vii)
The Brookings Institution not only enumerates
transparently the similar points that Iran is not an existential threat but
goes further to enumerate a list of strategies for US provocations against
Iran to initiate a war that, according to the report, Iran does not want.
It is even noted that an Iranian retaliation in
the case of American airstrikes would not be inevitable and that Iran may
deliberately refrain from retaliation in order to strategically "play the
victim" (pg. 84-85, 95)
Let it not be forgotten how the US and Britain
staged the
CIA "Operation Ajax" in 1953 to oust the democratically-elected Iranian
president Mohammad Mosaddegh, who nationalized the countrys oil, in
favor of the pro-American Shah who ruled as a brutal dictator.
Similar plans for regime change are enumerated
in the Brookings Institute report where it is admitted that the opposition
"Green Movement" in 2009 was orchestrated by the US government through
"civil society and NGOs" in order to provoke Iranian belligerence through
regime change operations, capitalizing on internal dissent.
This is not to deny any legitimate aspirations
and calls for reform in Iran which are prevalent among student groups but
merely to point out how such ambitions are co-opted and used by western
interests for their own agenda (103-105, 109-110).
See this
excellent
summary of all these critical points.
Other means proposed included playing upon
sectarian and ethnic divisions inside Iran to destabilize the country and
even funding radical Sunni militant groups, specifically the MEK, which has
killed Americans in the past and is labeled by the U.S. state department as
a "foreign terrorist organization".
Its ideology is described by analysts as radical
"left-wing" Islamic-Marxism which makes it interesting to consider the US
plans to fully employ this group as political assets. MEK has also
collaborated with Saddam Husseins forces in guerilla warfare against Iran
in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s.
The group is against the dominant Iranian
establishment and it is noted that the US has worked covertly with them in
the past and that in order to work overtly with them, the group had to be
removed from the terrorist list.
The compounded criminality of western and
Israeli collaboration with MEK is emphasized
here. It should be noted that the MEK has recently been removed from the
US list of terrorist organizations as part of the next phase of using them
as a proxy.
MEK claims to have killed 40,000 Iranians in the
past and has been trained on U.S. soil in a secret base in Nevada, published
on the Huffington Post and
cited here by Kurt Nimmo in an excellent and well-sourced article
emphasizing the coordinated western agenda against Iran.
In culminating these abhorrent proposals,
Brookings further notes the option of a military invasion and conventional
war against Iran if the above proposals failed to accomplish western
interests.
This is the most alarming option especially in
context to the following admission:
If the United States were to decide that to
garner greater international support, galvanize U.S. domestic support,
and/or provide a legal justification for an invasion, it would be best
to wait for an Iranian provocation, then the time frame for an invasion
might stretch out indefinitely.
However, since it would be up to Iran to
make the provocative move, which Iran has been wary of doing most times
in the past, the United States would never know for sure when it would
get the requisite Iranian provocation. In fact, it might never come at
all
it would be far more preferable if the United States could cite an
Iranian provocation as justification for the airstrikes [as a catalyst
for an invasion] before launching them.
Clearly, the more outrageous, the more
deadly, and the more unprovoked the Iranian action, the better off the
United States would be.
Of course, it would be very difficult for
the United States to goad Iran into such a provocation without the rest
of the world recognizing this game, which would then undermine it.
In all this certified criminality, which has
obviously been at play even as the report was being published in 2009, it
must not be forgotten that
the
Brookings Institution is of, for, and by big business and their
collective agenda of integrating Iran into their international consensus and
exploiting its 76 million population for their unipolar order.
This is
opposed to Irans attempts to foster national self-sufficiency and develop
ties with nations strategic to western interests including
India, Thailand, China, and Russia.
Brookings Institution is funded by
the likes of the,
...among others.
Their report
even includes a special acknowledgement of financial support from the Smith
Richardson Foundation upon which Zbigniew Brzezinski sits as an active
governor.
Such international criminality is magnified when
Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist
Seymour Hersh revealed in his article "Preparing the Battlefield" that
the U.S. is cooperating with their anti-Iranian terrorist asset, Saudi
Arabia, in order to fund radical, Al Qaeda-linked, Sunni-groups
like the Jundallah to destabilize and
destroy Iran as a viable geopolitical opponent.
Al Qaeda, directed by the
Saudis in cooperation with western geopolitical objectives, has been
leveraged as a "Swiss army knife of destabilization" across the Middle East
in the fake "war on terror" as Seymour Hersh exposed in another report
titled "The
Redirection" published in 2007.
In that report, Hersh reveals that the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia have been working since 2007 to destabilize Syria and Lebanon
with a
proxy-war wave of sectarian-extremists currently being marketed in the
media as a "political uprising" and a "revolution".
This is different from
the legitimate internal political opposition in Syria that maintains
distinctiveness from the extremist and terrorist elements that clearly
constitute the bulk of the "Syrian rebels" supported by the west.
In "The
Redirection", Seymour Hersh states:
To undermine Iran, which is predominantly
Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure
its priorities in the Middle East.
In Lebanon, the Administration has
cooperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in
clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite
organization that is backed by Iran. The U.S. has also taken part in
clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria.
A by-product of these activities has been
the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision
of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda
[Saudi
Arabia's Prince] Bandar and other Saudis have assured the White House
that "they will keep a very close eye on the religious fundamentalists.
Their message to us was Weve created this
movement, and we can control it. Its not that we dont want the
Salafis [Al Qaeda] to throw bombs; its who they throw them at -
Hezbollah, Moqtada al-Sadr, Iran, and at the Syrians, if they continue
to work with Hezbollah and Iran.
NGOs and "System
Administrators" - Trojan Horses for International Subversion
The role of "system administrators" was a
crucial element in both the British Empire and the current globalist system
when coming from the "humanitarian" angle.
During the days of the British Empire, system
administrators were networks created by the financial ruling class of the
empire that served to further the empire, sometimes under the guise of
altruistic or religious covers.
A case study of this can be found in the
invaluable work of Trevor Reeses book
Colonial Georgia - A Study in British Imperial Policy in the Eighteenth
Century which documents the foundation of what is now the U.S. State of
Georgia in 1733 in context to British imperial policy and mercantilism.
The "Georgia Trustees" group was pivotal in the
founding of Georgia by mobilizing insolvent debtors from London prisons to
Georgia on behalf of the empire.
In the study by Trevor Reese, it is demonstrated
that those behind groups such as the Georgia Trustees were always the
financial elite in London using such fronts to dictate peoples destinies on
their behalf, regardless of the outcomes.
Reese notes that,
"The dependence of Georgia on the continual
assistance of the United Kingdom was some justification for regarding it
more as British property than as an individual entity within itself.
There was never any idea of the colonys
being other than subordinate and contributory to the welfare of its
mother-country."
(Reese
38)
Modern-day empire treats its global "civil
society" networks throughout various countries in a similar manner.
Georgia also lacked manufacturing which made it
foundationally dependent on the mother country as was to be expected in the
mercantilist system, thus curtailing their freedom through the absence of
self-sufficiency and imperial dependency.
The modern reincarnation of the "Georgia
Trustees" is seen in the role of corporate-financier funded, western-tied
international "non-governmental organizations" (NGOs). NGOs serve as
networks of intrusion into sovereign nations institutions with the intent
of absorbing those nations into the agenda of the international consensus of
Wall Street and London.
This is not merely a cynical analysis born of
speculation but
openly admitted by Pentagon strategist Thomas Barnett at 2008 TED talk:
He talks of reforming the U.S. military force
into the "U.S.-enabled Leviathan force" which includes military assets to
tear down targeted institutions and also creating an army of "system
administrators" like NGOs, international organizations, and contractors to
"build in the swath of destruction" a network favorable to western
interests.
NGOs have been prominent in triggering the
U.S. engineered Arab Spring as an admitted geopolitical stunt designed
to contain Russian and Chinese economic interests and establish a front of
proxy governments as geopolitical analysts like William Engdahl have
noted.
This modus operandi has been documented and dubbed the "The
Revolution Business" by Journeyman Pictures:
It utilizes subversive NGOs like
CANVAS, run by Srdja Popovic, to train hordes of activists to target and
dismantle governments of various natures that do not comply with the
prevailing corporatist geopolitical interests, in conjunction
with a treasonous US State Department.
The "Arab Spring" is an overtly documented case
of such machinations under the pretext of nonviolent resistance and in Syria
and Libyas case, armed terrorist insurrection.
That is not to say that there were not
legitimate grievances throughout the Arab world that led well-intentioned
people to protest but the collective energies of these people were siphoned
off and directed as a "Swiss army knife" of destabilization not in pursuit
of their own interests but in the interests of the disingenuous leaders who
lorded over them.
In Egypt, that leader was
Mohammad ElBaradei who feigned anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments
while being part of the International Crisis Group (ICG), the
previously-mentioned US foreign policy think-tank funded by the Fortune-500
and notorious for international subversion of many shapes and for the same
policies of America and Israel he criticized for political leverage.
It is funded by people from the Carnegie Corporation, Morgan Stanley,
Open Society Institute, Deutsche Bank Group, and McKinsey & Company to
Chevron and Shell.
The ICG also hosts the likes of the previously
mentioned Zbigniew Brzezinski and General
Wesley Clark:
ICG has been involved in fomenting street
violence in Thailand (full
history here) in an attempt to reinstall renegade criminal Thaksin
Shinawatra into office on behalf of his Fortune-500 backers,
exploiting "socialist" ideology
to build a support base among Thai
peasants through populist handouts.
This is not to mention his attempt to push
through the Thai parliament without approval a "US-Thailand
Free Trade Agreement" written in a manner that would open up Thailands
indigenous markets to corporate plundering. Thaksin was also the imperialist
proxy-of-choice to remake Thailand as a bulwark against Chinese interests in
Southeast Asia and create an environment favorable to western interests.
In the wake of the Arab Spring, a similar
maneuver would be conducted against Tunisia and Egypt.
Tunisias "activist" leader and later president,
Moncef Marzouki, would be directly tied to the Soros funded
"International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)" and also the US state
department through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) which is the closest modern
equivalent to the "Georgia Trustees" and would toe the line of western
policy against Syria as well as providing a doorway into his nation for
western interests.
This is only scratching the surface of the
crisscrossing and interlocking lines of compromised interests who, from
Tunisia to Thailand, sought full spectrum dominance in Eurasia.
While such groups like NED, FIDH, and their many
outlets thrive on the basis of humanitarian concerns and altruism, they
always end up being funded by disingenuous corporate-interests and
individuals like
George Soros,
who was found to be behind the NGOs writing
Egypts post-"revolution"
constitution.
Not everyone involved at the lower level of
western-tied activist groups is disingenuous in intention but the efforts of
well-intentioned people are exploited to push forward an agenda in the
makings of its financial masters and leaders and not the people.
As in the case of Amnesty International, blatant
factual manipulation is used to demonize, for example,
Russias stance on Syria; Amnesty International has been used as
a tool to bolster western geopolitical
objectives, irrespective of the facts
on the ground and with glaring and deliberate omissions on who truly is
commandeering the bulk of atrocities around the world.
Such groups end up interlocking with other
corporate-funded foundations and think tanks from the Council on Foreign
Relations to the Brookings Institute just like the Georgia Trustees and
colonial networks interlocked with the Board of Trade in London during the
height of the British Empire.
Self-Sufficiency and
Technology - The Keys to Lasting and Active Liberty
A final point of comparison revolves around the
manner in which the British Empire was dismantled and the promise that it
holds to dismantling the current imperialist system.
The key lies in boycotting the corrupt system
and its corporate backbone and building self-sufficient communities outside
of it.
The
American Revolution was more than simply the war that made it possible.
Rather, the colonists realized the oppressiveness of the British imperialist
system and refused to play into both its economic and political game.
The colonialists boycotted the exploitative
imperialist racket of mercantilism during what was called the "non-importation
movement."
Communities collaborated locally to produce
"homespun" clothing and build up their own economic dependence, causing much
ire for the Crown and British merchants (Tindall 186).
The First Continental Congress adopted the
Continental Association of 1774 which sought to galvanize communities into
forming committees dedicated to the absolute boycott of British goods,
enraging King George III. It was these drives of the colonists to free
themselves from the imperialist system that truly granted the Americans
victory.
As George Brown Tindall and David
Emory Shi eloquently note in their book America: A Narrative History:
Such efforts to gain economic
self-sufficiency helped bind the diverse colonies by ropes of shared
resistance.
Thousands of ordinary men and women
participated in the boycott of British goods, and their sacrifices on
behalf of colonial liberties provided the momentum leading to
revolution.
For all the attention given to colonial
leaders such as Sam Adams and Thomas Jefferson, it was common people who
enforced the boycott, volunteered in "Rebel" militia units, attended
town meetings, and increasingly exerted pressure on royal officials in
the colonies.
The "Founding Fathers" (a phrase coined in
1916) could not have led the Revolutionary movement without such
widespread popular support.
As the people of Pittsfield, Massachusetts,
Declared in a petition,
"We have always believed that the people
are the fountains of power."
(193)
Tony Cartalucci capitalizes on this point in
his ideologies against the current system
of globalization and corporatist-driven economic interdependency and relates
these principles to the modern era and the
destructive nature of centralized big retail.
He notes that the "founding
fathers did not drink British tea" and that by declaring their
independence, the colonialists were already free and independent men and
that the coming war was the means by which they would defend their
independence, not achieve it.
The colonists invested in their own
infrastructure and sought to assert their independence through will and
effort.
Likewise,
we must individually recognize the corporations
perpetuating global
subversion and imperialism as well as exploiting low-wage labor oversees
and actively work to
boycott and replace them with viable, local, decentralized options.
Technology now exists to make any nation self-sufficient and independent as
opposed to the corporate-financier alternative of existential
interdependency and unipolar control.
We need
an alternative economic model with emphasis on individual enterprise and
technological investment being used locally and in politically-conscious,
self-sufficient communities leveraging such technology to break their
dependence on destructive monopolies and
tip the balance in their favor.
That is not to say that we must start making our
own cloths and revert back to pre-industrial habits.
On the contrary, this vision involves the active
leveraging of the latest cutting-edge of technology by both communities and
nations as a whole to build educated people and use that technology to solve
local problems and national problems pragmatically instead of relying on the
illusions of parasitic corporations and endless, co-opted political
"theaters".
There is the growing "personal fabrication"
movement
as envisioned by MITs Dr. Neil Gershenfeld that could
revolutionize production and enterprise:
Gershenfeld states that,
"the other 5 billion people on the planet
arent just technical sinks, they are sources. The real opportunity
is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and
produce solutions to local problems".
He notes how this has been legally impeded by
corporate-interests seeking to preserve their influence.
The "Do-It-Yourself"
movement is spurring individual and community-centered enterprise and
development and is prodding humanity along into a new industrial revolution,
one where power will be decentralized by the means of technology and wealth
redistributed, not through government subsidies, but through "individual
enterprise" and "entrepreneurship and collaboration" (see "Decentralize
Big Retail").
We must cut off the "globalists" from their
support base among the misguided masses, stop playing into their media
propaganda game, and build up our own infrastructure and communities to
answer to our own demands and not that of the Fortune 500.
Reality demonstrates the truth of Vincent Harlows observation, especially
with regards to the subversive role empire has played and continues to play
in the world today. Whether it is through the function of empire, the role
of system administrators or even the keys to its dismantling, reality echoes
the same theme.
Enslavement is the end game of imperialism but truth is present among the
constant lies fed to humanity by a compromised mass media.
Truth
offers the key to freedom and that freedom is what comes when one is able to
recognize the lies and workings
of a rebranded form of empire.
People must unite in knowledge and concern for the affairs of their nation
and actively work to expose establishment lies, invest in their communities,
and build the backbones of a self-sufficient nation in the image of the
people.
