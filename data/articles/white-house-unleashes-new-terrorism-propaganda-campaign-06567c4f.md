Yesterday the White House revealed a new plan to
fight what they allege is the threat of homegrown terrorism; a threat which
I have been pointing out has been
artificially hyped up for some time now.
The
Obama administration continues
to promulgate the fake threat of terrorism in order to justify their
increasing erosion of civil liberties and massive expenditures on so-called
counterterrorism efforts.
The program is aimed at even further integrating local and federal
authorities, just as the fusion centers do across the nation, along with
improving the ability for officers to recognize violent extremism,
according to ABC News.
However, I think we all know by now this means teaching them to be paranoid,
to ignore all facts that show the threat of terrorism is incredibly low, and
to be suspicious of their fellow citizens.
This new program isnt just integrating local law enforcement with federal
agencies as the fusion centers have been doing, it is also increasing,
coordination between local partners -
including schools and community groups, representing a new front in
fear mongering.
Through so-called community outreach programs,
the federal government fosters a pervasive sense of paranoia and fear which
allows for wildly un-American and incredibly dangerous legislation like
S.1867 to pass with such astounding margins.
The Obama administrations new plan has already drawn criticism from
Senators Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman who questioned the omission of
radical Islam from the new document.
The 24-page report released yesterday draws parallels between domestic
extremism and gang violence and sexual offenses while a recent
Department of Defense letter called the Fort Hood shooting workplace
violence.
We also continue to be disappointed by the
administrations refusal to identify violent Islamist extremism as our
enemy, the statement from Collins and Lieberman said.
To understand this threat and counter it,
we must not shy away from making the sharp distinction between the
peaceful religion followed by millions of law-abiding Americans and a
twisted corruption of that religion used to justify violence.
This also follows the trend I have been
observing for some time of shifting the alleged threat away from Muslim
extremists and towards regular Americans.
This latest report from the Obama administration is clearly pushing the
narrative that the real threat is average American citizens and not foreign
radical militants, a move which is undoubtedly related to the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
As I recently covered, countless Americans could easily be rounded up and,
at best, treated as Civilian Internees, although it is much more likely that
anyone determined to be a belligerent (even if it is only ideological)
will be treated as an Enemy Prisoner of War.
The report, entitled Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local
Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States, claims,
Protecting our nations communities from
violent extremist recruitment and radicalization is a top national
security priority. It is an effort that requires creativity, diligence
and commitment to our fundamental rights and principles.
The part about commitment to our fundamental
rights and principles is outright laughable seeing as the Obama
administration has trampled all over our fundamental rights and principles
with glee.
Just as we engage and raise awareness to
prevent gang violence, sexual offenses, school shootings and other acts
of violence, so too must we ensure that our communities are empowered to
recognize threats of violent extremism and understand the range of
government and nongovernment resources that can help keep their
families, friends and neighbors safe, the report said.
This is the type of fear mongering that drives
people to live in a constantly paranoid state in which theyre perpetually
trying to recognize threats of violent extremism when there are none to be
found.
But of course that is exactly what the federal government wants, as without
creating a culture of fear, there is no justification for the steady erosion
of our most essential rights and liberties.
While Collins and Lieberman criticized the Obama
administrations perceived failure to identify radical Islam as a dangerous
factor, they did laud the White House for making progress in what Fox News
calls,
counter[ing] propaganda and coordinat[ing]
with local communities.
Exactly what they mean by propaganda is unclear,
but in reality the only propaganda that needs to be countered is that which
is disseminated by the U.S. government.
Lieberman and Collins, who are the chairman and ranking Republican on the
Senates Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, respectively,
cited 33 cases of homegrown terror plots since 2009 which have resulted in
the deaths of 14 Americans.
However, they fail to point out that in the vast majority of these cases,
the alleged terrorists dealt with the Federal Bureau of Investigations or
other government agents the entire time.
A
fantastic article in Mother Jones exposed just how the FBI goes about
manufacturing these terrorists in order to justify the homeland security
industry.
Martin Stolar, a lawyer who represented an individual caught up in a
sting involving the Herald Square subway station in New York in 2004 told
Mother Jones,
Theyre creating crimes to solve crimes so
they can claim a victory in the war on terror.
At this point, this fact is irrefutable and with
every supposed domestic terrorism case that grabs headlines, it becomes even
clearer that the real terrorists work out of expensive offices in Washington
and are engineering fake terror events on a regular basis in order to
justify their treasonous activities.
With some of the most atrocious legislation coming our way in the near
future, it can only be expected that this propaganda will continue to be
pushed in order to justify stripping Americans of their most essential civil
liberties.
