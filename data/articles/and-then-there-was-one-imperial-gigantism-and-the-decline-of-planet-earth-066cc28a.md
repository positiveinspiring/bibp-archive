It stretched from the Caspian to the Baltic Sea,
from the middle of Europe to the Kurile Islands in the Pacific, from Siberia
to Central Asia.
Its nuclear arsenal held 45,000
warheads, and its military had five
million troops under arms. There had been nothing like it in Eurasia
since the Mongols conquered China, took parts of Central Asia and the
Iranian plateau, and rode into the Middle East, looting Baghdad.
Yet when the Soviet Union collapsed in December
1991, by far the poorer, weaker imperial power disappeared. And then there
was one. There had never been such a moment: a single nation astride the
globe without a competitor in sight.
There wasnt even a name for such a state (or
state of mind).
-
"Superpower" had already been used when
there were two of them.
-
"Hyperpower" was tried briefly but
didnt stick.
-
"Sole superpower" stood in for a while
but didnt satisfy.
-
"Great Power," once the zenith of
appellations, was by then a lesser phrase, left over from the
centuries when various European nations and Japan were expanding
their empires.
Some started speaking about a "unipolar" world
in which all roads led... well, to Washington.
To this day, weve never quite taken in that
moment when Soviet imperial rot unexpectedly -
above all, to Washington - became imperial crash-and-burn. Left
standing, the Cold War's victor seemed, then, like an empire of everything
under the sun.
It was as if humanity had always been traveling
toward this spot. It seemed like the end of the line.
The Last Empire?
After the rise and fall of,
-
the Assyrians
-
the Romans
-
the Persians
-
the Chinese
-
the Mongols
-
the Spanish
-
the Portuguese
-
the Dutch
-
the French
-
the English
-
the Germans
-
the Japanese,
...some process seemed over.
The United States was dominant in a previously
unimaginable way - except in Hollywood films where villains cackled about
their evil plans to dominate the world.
As a start, the U.S. was an empire of global
capital. With the fall of Soviet-style communism (and the transformation of
a communist regime in China into a crew of authoritarian "capitalist
roaders"), there was no other model for how to do anything, economically
speaking.
There was Washingtons way - and that of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (both controlled by
Washington) - or there was the highway, and the Soviet Union had already
made it all too clear where that led: to obsolescence and ruin.
In addition, the U.S. had unprecedented military
power. By the time the Soviet Union began to totter, America's leaders had
for nearly a decade been consciously using "the arms race" to spend its
opponent into an early grave.
And here was the curious thing after centuries
of arms races: when there was no one left to race, the U.S. continued an
arms race of one.
In the years that followed, it would
outpace all other countries or combinations of countries in military
spending by staggering amounts. It housed the worlds
most powerful weapons makers, was technologically light years ahead of
any other state, and was continuing to develop
future weaponry for 2020, 2040, 2060, even as it
established a
near monopoly on the global arms trade (and so, control over who would
be well-armed and who wouldnt).
It had an
empire of
bases abroad, more than
1,000 of them spanning the globe, also an unprecedented phenomenon. And
it was culturally dominant, again in a way that made comparisons with other
moments ludicrous.
Like American weapons makers producing things
that went boom in the night for an international audience, Hollywood's
action and fantasy films took the world by storm. From those movies to the
golden arches, the swoosh, and the personal computer, there was no other
culture that could come close to claiming such a global cachet.
The key non-U.S. economic powerhouses of the
moment - Europe and Japan - maintained militaries dependent on Washington,
had U.S. bases littering their territories, and continued to nestle under
Washingtons "nuclear umbrella."
No wonder that, in the U.S., the post-Soviet
moment was soon proclaimed "the
end of history," and the victory of "liberal democracy" or "freedom" was
celebrated as if there really were no tomorrow, except more of what today
had to offer.
No wonder that, in the new century, neocons and
supporting pundits would begin to claim that the British and Roman
empires had been second-raters by comparison. No wonder that key figures in
and around the George W. Bush administration
dreamed of establishing a Pax Americana in the Greater Middle
East and possibly over the globe itself (as well as a Pax Republicana
at home).
They imagined that they might
actually prevent another competitor or bloc of competitors from arising
to challenge American power. Ever.
No wonder they had remarkably few hesitations
about launching their incomparably powerful military on wars of choice in
the Greater Middle East.
Assessing the Imperial
Moment, Twenty-First-Century-Style
Almost a quarter of a century after the Soviet
Union disappeared, whats remarkable is how much - and how little - has
changed.
On the how-much front: Washingtons dreams of
military glory ran aground with remarkable speed in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Then, in 2007, the transcendent empire of capital came close to imploding as
well, as a unipolar financial disaster spread across the planet.
It led people to begin to wonder whether the
globes greatest power might not, in fact, be too big to fail, and we were
suddenly - so everyone said - plunged into a "multipolar world."
Meanwhile, the Greater Middle East descended
into protest, rebellion, civil war, and chaos without a Pax Americana
in sight, as a Washington-controlled Cold War system in the region shuddered
without (yet) collapsing. The ability of Washington to impose its will on
the planet looked ever more like the wildest of fantasies, while every sign,
including the hemorrhaging of national treasure into losing
trillion-dollar wars, reflected not ascendancy but possible decline.
And yet, in the how-little category: the
Europeans and Japanese remained nestled under that American "umbrella,"
their territories still filled with U.S. bases.
In the Euro Zone, governments
continued to cut back on their investments in both NATO and their own
militaries. Russia remained a country with a sizeable nuclear arsenal and a
reduced but still large military. Yet it showed no signs of "superpower"
pretensions.
Other regional powers
challenged unipolarity economically - Turkey and Brazil, to name two -
but not militarily, and none showed an urge either singly or in blocs to
compete in an imperial sense with the U.S.
Washingtons enemies in the world remained
remarkably modest-sized (though blown to enormous proportions in the
American media echo-chamber). They included a couple of rickety regional
powers (Iran and North Korea), a minority insurgency or two, and relatively
small groups of Islamist "terrorists."
Otherwise, as one gauge of power on the planet,
no more than a
handful of other countries had even a
handful of military bases outside their territory.
Under the circumstances, nothing could have been
stranger than this: in its moment of total ascendancy, the Earths sole
superpower with a military of staggering destructive potential and
technological sophistication couldnt win a war against minimally armed
guerillas.
Even more strikingly, despite having no serious
opponents anywhere, it seemed not on the rise but on the decline, its
infrastructure
rotting out, its populace economically depressed, its wealth
ever more unequally divided, its Congress seemingly beyond repair, while
the great sucking sound that could be heard was money and power heading
toward the national security state.
Sooner or later, all empires fall, but
this moment was proving curious indeed.
And then, of course, there was China. On the
planet that humanity has inhabited these last several thousand years, can
there be any question that China would have been the obvious pick to
challenge, sooner or later, the dominion of the reigning great power of the
moment?
Estimates are that it will
surpass the U.S. as the globes number one economy by perhaps 2030.
Right now, the Obama administration seems to be
working on just that assumption. With its well-publicized "pivot"
(or "rebalancing") to Asia, it has been moving to "contain" what it fears
might be the next great power.
However, while the Chinese are indeed
expanding their military and
challenging their neighbors in the waters of the Pacific, there is no
sign that the countrys leadership is ready to embark on anything like a
global challenge to the U.S., nor that it could do so in any conceivable
future.
Its domestic problems, from
pollution to
unrest, remain staggering enough that its hard to imagine a China not
absorbed with domestic issues through 2030 and beyond.
And Then There Was One
(Planet)
Militarily, culturally, and even to some extent
economically, the U.S. remains surprisingly alone on planet Earth in
imperial terms, even if little has worked out as planned in Washington.
The story of the years since the Soviet Union
fell may prove to be a tale of how American domination and decline went
hand-in-hand, with the decline part of the equation being strikingly
self-generated.
And yet heres a genuine, even confounding,
possibility: that moment of "unipolarity" in the 1990s may really have been
the end point of history as human beings had known it for millennia - the
history, that is, of the rise and fall of empires.
One thing is increasingly clear: whatever the
state of imperial America, something significantly more crucial to the fate
of humanity (and of empires) is in decline. Im talking, of course,
about the planet itself.
The present capitalist model (the only one
available) for a rising power, whether China, India, or Brazil, is also a
model for planetary decline, possibly of a precipitous nature.
The very definition of success - more
middle-class consumers, more car owners, more shoppers, which means more
energy used, more fossil fuels burned, more greenhouse gases entering the
atmosphere - is also, as it never would have been before, the definition of
failure.
The greater the "success," the more intense the
droughts, the stronger the storms, the more extreme the weather, the higher
the rise in
sea levels, the hotter the temperatures, the greater
the chaos in low-lying or tropical lands, the more profound the failure.
The question is:
-
Will this put an end to the previous
patterns of history, including the until-now-predictable rise of the
next great power, the next empire?
-
On a devolving planet, is it even
possible to imagine the next stage in imperial gigantism?
Every factor that would normally lead toward
"greatness" now also leads toward global decline.
This process - which couldnt be more unfair to
countries having their industrial and consumer revolutions late - gives a
new meaning to the phrase "disaster
capitalism."
Take the Chinese, whose leaders, on leaving the
Maoist model behind, did the most natural thing in the world at the time:
they patterned their future economy on the United States - on, that is,
success as it was then defined.
Despite both traditional and revolutionary
communal traditions, for instance, they decided that to be a power in the
world, you needed to make the car (which meant the individual driver) a
pillar of any future state-capitalist China. If it worked for the U.S., it
would work for them, and in the short run, it worked like a dream, a
capitalist miracle - and China rose.
It was, however, also a formula for massive
pollution, environmental degradation, and the pouring of ever more fossil
fuels into the atmosphere in
record amounts. And it's not just China.
It doesnt matter whether youre talking about
that country's ravenous energy use, including its possible future "carbon
bombs," or the potential for American decline to be halted by new
extreme methods of producing energy (fracking,
tar-sands extraction, deep-water drilling).
Such methods, however much they hurt local
environments, might indeed
turn the U.S. into a "new
Saudi Arabia."
Yet that, in turn, would only contribute further
to the degradation of the planet, to decline on an ever-larger scale.
-
What if, in the twenty-first century,
going up means declining?
-
What if the unipolar moment turns out to
be a planetary moment in which previously distinct imperial events -
the rise and fall of empires - fuse into a single disastrous system?
What if the story of our times is this:
And then there was one planet, and it was
going down.
