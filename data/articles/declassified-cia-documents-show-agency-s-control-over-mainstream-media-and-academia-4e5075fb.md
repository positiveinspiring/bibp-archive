# Declassified CIA Documents show Agency's Control over Mainstream Media 
and Academia

> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_cia42.htm

The document
states that the CIA task force,
"now has
relationships with reporters from every major wire service,
newspaper, news weekly, and television network in the nation,"
and that "this has helped us turn some 'intelligence failure'
stories into 'intelligence success' stories, and has
contributed to the accuracy of countless others."
Furthermore, it
explains how the agency has,
"persuaded
reporters to postpone, change, hold, or even scrap stories that
could have adversely affected
national security interests or jeopardized sources and
methods."
Although it is a
document outlining their desire to become more open and transparent,
the deception outlined by various whistleblowers (example)
requires us to read between the lines and recognize that the
relationships shared between intelligence agencies and our sources
of information are not always warranted and pose inherent conflicts
of interest.
Herein lies the
problem:
What is
"national security," and who determines that definition?
JFK bravely told
the world that the,
"dangers of excessive and
unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighs the
dangers which are cited to justify it."
He also said that,
"there
is very grave danger that an announced need for increased
security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its
meaning to the very limits of official censorship and
concealment."
"National security"
is now an umbrella term used to justify concealing information, but
who makes these decisions?

about our world of secrecy and the Black Budget
here.
Not only
are countless documents classified every single year in North
America, but false information and "fake news" are routinely
dispersed, mainly by mainstream media outlets - a reality that is
clearly conveyed in this document and has been expressed by multiple
mainstream media journalists themselves.
And as with the NSA
surveillance program that was exposed by Edward Snowden, it's a
global problem.
Dr. Udo Ulfkotte,
a prominent German journalist and editor for more than two
decades, is one example. He blew the whistle on public television,
stating that he was forced to publish the works of intelligence
agencies under his own name and that noncompliance with these orders
would result in him losing his job. (source)
Sharyl
Attkisson and Amber Lyon, both well-known mainstream
media reporters and journalists, have also exposed funded movements
by political, corporate, and other special interests, and have
revealed that they are routinely paid by the U.S. government as well
as foreign governments to selectively report and distort information
on certain events. (source)

Let's not forget
about Operation
Mockingbird, a CIA-based initiative to control mainstream media.
The document not
only outlines the CIA's role in media, but also the entire
entertainment industry in general, lending further weight to
revelations offered by celebrities like Jim Carrey.
He appeared as a
guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live, saying that,
"For years now,
talk show hosts, people on television, people in sitcoms have
been, hired by the government to throw you off the tracks, to
distract you, to make you laugh and stuff like that, make you
happy and docile so you don't know what's really going on."
While some
question whether he was merely joking, the facts still remain.
Another celebrity,
who was clearly serious, is Roseanne Barr, who referenced the
CIA's
MK Ultra mind control program - a previously classified research
program through the CIA's scientific intelligence division that
tested behavioral modification and perception manipulation on human
beings.
What we seem to
have here is an attempt to manipulate public perception of global
events through mainstream media and news publications.
But what's perhaps
most interesting is the fact that a lot of people are now waking up
and seeing through many of these lies and manipulation tactics.
Instead of just blindly believing what we hear on television, more
people are starting to think critically, do independent research,
and examine a wide array of sources and information.
So many
opportunities have emerged within the past few years allowing others
to see this more clearly. One was the recent "fake news" epidemic,
where evidence surfaced exposing information that threatened the
global elite.
Wikileaks is
perhaps one of the greatest examples.
For mainstream
media to basically label everything else as "fake news" was quite
ironic, given that it seems the majority of people consider
mainstream media themselves to be the real "fake news," and this is
now even more evident given the information presented above in this
article.
The documents also
touch upon the fact that they are constantly in touch with the
entertainment industry, giving advice on scenes and direction, as
well as how things happened in certain situations.
Personally, I feel
the industry is largely used to push propaganda, like patriotism.
Patriotism is pumped into the population to support a large military
in the name of "national security."
We are being
fooled, wars are not waged for defense, but for offence and to push
forth political agendas.
So you see, there
are multiple reasons for these CIA connections to various
industries.
Academia
From a young age
we're taught that getting an education is the key to living a good
life.
Getting a
decent job, making good money, even finding the right partner - all
depend on following a certain path. Yet many concepts and topics
are, as previously illustrated, kept from public viewing, and this
includes plenty of important science.
The U.S.
intelligence community investigated parapsychology (ESP,
remote viewing, telepathy, etc.) for more than two decades, for
instance.
Russell Targ,
a physicist who has spent several decades working in a U.S.
government program exploring these concepts, recently shared his
experience doing so in a
TED talk that is now approaching 1 million views.
Another great
example of Black Budget science comes from Ben Rich, the
second director of Lockheed Skunkworks, who worked there from
1975-1991.
He's been called
the Father of Stealth, having overseen the development of the first
stealth fighter, the F-117 Nighthawk.
Before his death,
Rich made several shocking open statements about the reality of UFOs
and extraterrestrials.
"We already have the means to
travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in
black projects, and it would take an act of God to ever get them
out to benefit humanity. Anything you can imagine, we already
know how to do it."
"We now have technology to take ET
home. No it won't take someone's lifetime to do it. There is an
error in the equations. We know what it is. We now have the
capability to travel to the stars."
"There are two types of UFOs - the
ones we build and the ones 'they' build."
To read more about
those comments and examine the sources, you can refer to
this article that goes into more detail about it.
Information like
this, including testimony from hundreds of others, suggests that the
"classified world" is much more advanced than our mainstream one.
This particular
document states that the agency exposes administrators of academic
institutions to the agency on a regular basis.
Obviously, as with
any other job, the CIA would be looking for what they consider to be
qualified individuals. But the document does outline its close
relationship with academia in general.
This is because
certain developments and information that stem from academia could
threaten national security and therefore must be kept out of the
curriculum, and the public domain.
Take, for
example, documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
that reveal how the U.S. government has been using a secret system
to withhold the approval of some applications.
This 50-page
document was obtained by Kilpatrick Towsend & Stockton, LLP, who
commonly represent major tech companies that include Apple, Google,
and Twitter (to name a few). You can view that entire document

The program
delaying patent applications is called the Sensitive Application
Warning System (SWAS).
Usually when an
application is submitted for a patent approval, it requires a couple
of examiners who work with the Patent Office to go through their
process of approval.
This process
usually takes one to two years, but applications that are filed in
SAWS must be approved from several people, and can be delayed for a
number of years.
One great example
(out of many) of delayed patent applications comes from Dr.
Gerald F. Ross, who filed a patent application for a new
invention he had devised to defeat the jamming of electromagnetic
transmissions at specified frequencies.
It was not until
June 17, 2014 (almost 37 years later) that this patent was granted.
(source)
It's important to
note (as reported by the Federation of American Scientists -
see annotated bibliography) that there were over 5,000 inventions
that were under secrecy orders at the end of fiscal year 2014, which
marked the highest number of secrecy orders in effect since 1994. (source)
Steven Aftergood from
the Federation of American Scientists reports:
The 1971 list
indicates that patents for solar photovoltaic generators were
subject to review and possible restriction if the photovoltaics
were more than 20% efficient.
Energy
conversion systems were likewise subject to review and possible
restriction if they offered conversion efficiencies "in excess
of 70-80%."
source
This is all thanks
to an act many people are unaware of. It's called the "Invention
Secrecy Act," and it was written in 1951.
Under this act,
patent applications on new inventions can be subject to secrecy
orders, which can restrict their publication if government agencies
believe that their disclosure would be harmful to national security.

Final Thoughts
So, as you see,
science and academia in the mainstream world can only go so far.
We continue to rely
on government institutions to define truth and reality for us, to
outline the limits of what is possible. In many instances, these
places to which we go to "learn" are actually diminishing,
not supporting, our creativity and critical thinking skills.
That's not to say
that there aren't good aspects of the experience, but overall, we
are not accessing our full potential.
When information is
hidden from us as well as manipulated at the same time, it's only
going to spark more curiosity among the people. And that's one
aspect of the current shift in consciousness that's happening on our
planet.
We're beginning to
see the human experience in a different light, and starting
to recognize that the time for change is really here.
What are we going
to do about it?
