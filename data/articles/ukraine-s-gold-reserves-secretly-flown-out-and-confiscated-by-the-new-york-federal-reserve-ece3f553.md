A Russian Internet news site Iskra ("Spark")
based in Zaporozhye, eastern Ukraine,
reported on March
7, that
"Ukraine's
gold reserves had been hastily airlifted
to the United States from Borispol
Airport east of Kiev".
This alleged airlift and confiscation of
Ukraine's gold reserves
by the New York Federal Reserve
has not been
confirmed by the Western media.
According to
Iskra News:
At 2 a.m. this morning [March 7] an unmarked
transport plane was on the runway at Borispol Airport (below) [east of
Kiev]. According to airport staff, before the plane came to the airport,
four trucks and two Volkswagen minibuses arrived, all the truck license
plates missing.
Fifteen people in black uniforms, masks, and
body armor stepped out, some armed with machine guns. They loaded the plane
with more than 40 heavy boxes.
After that a mysterious man arrived and entered
the plane. All loading was done in a hurry. The plane took off on an emergency basis. Those who saw this mysterious special operation
immediately notified the airport officials, who told the callers not to
meddle in other people's affairs.
Later a returned call from a senior official of
the former Ministry of Revenue reported that tonight, on the orders of one
of the new leaders of Ukraine, the United States had taken custody
of all the gold reserves in Ukraine."

Following this disclosure, GATA's Secretary
Treasurer Chris Powell requested
the
'New' Federal Reserve and the US State
Department to indicate whether the NY FED had "taken custody" of Ukraine's
Gold.
A spokesman for the New York FED said simply:
"Any inquiry regarding gold accounts should be directed to the account
holder. You may want to contact the National Bank of Ukraine to discuss this
report."
GATA's similar inquiry of last night to the U.S.
State Department has not yet prompted any reply.
Last night GATA called this issue to the
attention of about 30 mainstream financial journalists and newsletter
writers in the admittedly bizarre hope that they might pose the question as
well.
-
The first rule of mainstream financial
journalism and particularly financial journalism about gold is never to put
a specific critical question about the monetary metal to any of the primary
participants in the gold market, central banks. That is, nearly all gold
market reporting is, by design, irrelevant distraction at best,
disinformation at worst.
-
The true location and disposition of
national gold reserves are secrets far more sensitive than the location and
disposition of nuclear weapons.

While the unconfirmed report regarding Ukraine's
gold reserves has not been the object of coverage by the mainstream
financial news, the story was nonetheless picked up by the Shanghai Metals
Market at Metal.com. which states, quoting a report from the Ukrainian government,
that Ukraine's gold reserves had been,
"moved on an aircraft from
Kiev to
the United States
in 40 sealed boxes" loaded on an unidentified aircraft.
The unconfirmed source quoted by Metal.com, says
that the operation to airlift Ukraine's gold had been ordered by the acting
Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk with a view to safe-keeping Ukraine's gold
reserves at the NY FED, against a possible Russian invasion which could lead
to the confiscation of Ukraine's gold reserves.
On March 10,
kingworldnews, a prominent online financial blog site published an
incisive interview with William Kaye, a Hong Kong based
hedge fund manager at Pacific Group Ltd. who had
previously worked for Goldman Sachs in mergers and acquisitions.
The Spoils of War and Regime Change
Of significance in this interview with William
Kaye is the analogy between Ukraine, Iraq and Libya.
Lest we forget, both
Iraq and Libya had their gold reserves confiscated by the US:
Ben Davies, CEO of
Hinde Capital
Kaye:
"There are now reports coming from Ukraine that all of the
Ukrainian gold has been airlifted, at 2 AM Ukrainian time, out of the main
airport, Boryspil Airport, in Kiev, and is being flown to New York - the
presumable destination being the New York FED
Now that's 33 tons of gold
which is worth somewhere between $1.5 billion - $2 billion.
That would amount to a very nice down
payment to the $5 billion that Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland
boasted that the United States has already spent in their efforts to
destabilize Ukraine, and put in place their own unelected
government.
Eric King: "Whether the United States is
taking down Saddam Hussein in Iraq, or Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, there
always seems to be gold at the end of the rainbow, which the U.S. then
appropriates."
Kaye:
"That's a good point, Eric. The United States installed a
former banker (Arseniy
Yatsenyuk) in Ukraine who is very friendly to the West. He is also a guy
with central bank experience. This would have been his first major decision
to transport that gold out of Ukraine to the United States.
You may recall that
allegedly the logistical requirements prevented the New York FED from
returning the 300 tons of gold the United States stores for Germany back to
Germany.
After a year of waiting, the New York
FED only sent Germany 5 tons
of gold. So only 5 tons of gold was sent from the FED to Germany, and it
wasn't even the 5 tons that had been originally stored with the FED.
Even the Bundesbank has
admitted that the gold sent to them by the New York FED had to be melted
down and tested for purity because it wasn't Germany's original bars.
So how
is it, since logistical requirements are supposedly such a major issue, that
in one airlift, assuming this report is accurate, all the gold Ukraine
possessed in their vault was taken out of Ukraine and delivered to the New
York FED?
I think anybody with any active brain cells
knows that just like Germany, Ukraine will
have to wait a very long time, and very likely will never see that gold
again.
Meaning, that gold is gone..."
