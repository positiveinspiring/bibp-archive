INTRODUCTION
About Svali
Svali used to be a programmer and trainer in the cult of
the
Illuminati.
Both she and her entire family were involved in the cult
group until several years ago, when they finally broke free.
She has been a consultant to an on-line survivors group that helps
people dealing with issues related to cult programming and ritual
abuse.
Svali, a writer and a registered nurse, has self-published a book on
breaking free of cult programming, which several experts in the
field have said has "invaluable information" for the survivor of
ritual abuse.
Her articles are
published online.
She is now married to her second husband and has two children.
