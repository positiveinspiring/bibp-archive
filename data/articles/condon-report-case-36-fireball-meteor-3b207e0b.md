Case 36
South Mountain
Fall 1967
Investigator: Wadsworth
BACK to Chapter 2
Abstract:
Four independent witnesses saw a glowing, rapidly moving object that
was evidently a "fireball" meteor.
Investigation:
A University Professor in the South Mountain area supplied statements
from four apparently independent witnesses of an aerial event for
possible interest.
-
About 9:05 a.m., a man on a golf course six miles east of the city
saw a glowing yellow and blue-green cylindrical object cross the sky
northward at high speed.
-
About 9:00 a.m., a commercial pilot flying about six miles southeast
of the city saw a glowing yellow and blue-green cylindrical object
travelling northward on a descending path at very high speed. It
exploded or deteriorated in midair as it approached the White
Mountain area. He judged it was a meteor.
-
About 9:00 a.m., a rancher and mine-mill worker, north of town, saw a
very bright object travelling at high speed northward on a descending
path. It exploded in the air.
-
About 10:00 a.m. a mining assayer driving west on the highway six
miles east of town saw a cylindrical object glowing a metallic
blue-green as it passed in front of him, travelling northward at
high speed.
Sighting Features:
The four sightings are summarized in Table 5. The preponderance of
similar features indicates a single event. Only in the

fourth sighting is there some reason for doubt. The discrepancies in
distance and size are hardly significant because such estimates are
characteristically inaccurate. Further, these are consistent in that
the ratios of size to distance estimated by witness I and II are
roughly similar. These two witnesses were very near each other, and
their accounts are similar except for the one hour discrepancy in
time. However, witness I was prompted to report his experience by
hearing a report of witness IV's experience on the radio, and so may
have been influenced by it.
The time discrepancy of one hour has not been accounted for. The
preponderance of evidence indicates an error in the time reported by
witness IV, but is just as possible that two meteoric fragments came
in on similar patterns an hour apart.
Reports of the first and fourth sightings were sent to Dr. Charles P.
Olivier of the American Meteor Society, who stated that both accounts
showed "every indication of being rather typical daylight fireball
reports."
Comment:
It is concluded that probably a single event was witnessed by four
observers, and that the object was a "fireball" meteor.
