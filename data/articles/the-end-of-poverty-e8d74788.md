Global poverty did not just happen. It began
with military conquest, slavery and colonization that resulted in the
seizure of land, minerals and forced labor.
Today, the problem persists
because of unfair debt, trade and tax policies - in other words, wealthy
countries taking advantage of poor, developing countries.
Renowned actor and
activist, Martin Sheen, narrates 'THE END OF POVERTY', a feature-length
documentary directed by award-winning director, Philippe Diaz, which
explains how today's financial crisis is a direct consequence of these
unchallenged policies that have lasted centuries.
Consider that 20% of the
planet's population uses 80% of its resources and consumes 30% more than the
planet can regenerate. At this rate, to maintain our lifestyle means more
and more people will sink below the poverty line.
Filmed in the slums of
Africa and the barrios of Latin America, 'THE END OF POVERTY' features expert
insights from:
-
Nobel prize winners in Economics, Amartya Sen and Joseph
Stiglitz
-
acclaimed authors Susan George, Eric Toussaint,
John Perkins,
Chalmers Johnson
-
university professors William Easterly and Michael Watts
-
government ministers such as Bolivia's Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera
-
leaders of social movements in Brazil, Venezuela, Kenya and
Tanzania
It is produced by Cinema Libre Studio in collaboration with the
Robert Schalkenbach Foundation.
Can we really end poverty within our current
economic system?
Think again...
