We will be presenting some of the details from our meeting with Dr Pete
Peterson last weekend (see below) - and Dan Burisch and Marci McDowell
will be presenting archive material never before made public. It may be
quite an event.
Meanwhile, Kerry and I are working through
the material recorded during our
visit to Dr Peterson. We have many hours of testimony.
We're working as fast
as we can to organize all this information and make public what is on
record.
Dr Peterson stated that he was personally convinced that there would be a
'bank holiday' this fall - and, apparently confirming this, we have been
contacted anonymously with a credible report of a shipment of signs to a
depot in California, stating
THIS AREA IS UNDER MARTIAL LAW. We take this seriously, and
are concerned.
On last Thursday's radio show, a medical doctor, named WATERMAN on the
Avalon Forum, phoned in to report a personal meeting with his Senator that
left him in little doubt that mandatory
vaccinations were on their way.
He
also described how he was invited to a pre-release screening of the new
movie, 33 Minutes (below video), in response to his direct question about
the possibility of a nuclear attack on the US.
There are multiple indications (as there were this time last year) that we
may have quite a challenging few months ahead of us all.
We would like to think that the planned events
may be averted or avoided, in total or in part: but it may be wise to take
precautions - each depending on our personal situation.

Kerry, David Wilcock and myself - with a friend
and colleague, 'Doc' Barham - are all traveling back from a particularly
significant trip to interview a key whistleblower, Dr Pete Peterson.
We did our best to give a summary of our experience on the
Camelot radio
show (all of us huddled over Kerry's cellphone in the airport departure
lounge) and we experienced a fair amount of chaos - which I suspect is
directly proportional, in a situation such as this, to the importance of the
information we were trying to impart. (below audios)
We hope the attempted broadcast was not too chaotic for listeners to endure:
we'll do rather better on Thursday with no interference or noise, and on a
good connection. In the meantime, stay tuned: we'll write up our report
soonest. We believe this may be the most significant interview we've yet
done.
Dr Peterson is an extremely well-informed insider - and a most remarkable
and brilliant scientist - who has come forward to talk with us publicly on
video because he feels the issues he cares deeply about, and knows about,
are too important to keep silent about. We salute his courage.
The nature of his testimony, as he described to us in a preliminary phone
conversation, was so extraordinary that I immediately flew to the US for the
weekend, where Kerry and I were joined by David Wilcock - the first time the
three of us have interviewed a witness together.
Among the many things Dr Peterson spoke about at length was his strong,
informed belief,
-
that there will be a
melt-down of the global economy - and
US infrastructure - within months
-
that
Obama is planning to
disclose the
reality of ET contact by the end of the year
-
that most, but not all, of
the ET visitors are friendly.
There is much, much more, but I am writing
this in the departure lounge of the same airport, and I have no more time as
my flight is being called.
More later in the next few days, and our thanks
again to all who helped make this possible.
