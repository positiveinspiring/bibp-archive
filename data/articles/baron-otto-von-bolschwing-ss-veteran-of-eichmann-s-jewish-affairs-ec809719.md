The
Long-hidden report: CIA created safe haven for Nazis in the US
obtained by the New York Times November 13, 2010, may be the most concrete
account yet of the role that prominent members of Germany's Nazi party
played in the early, formative years of the CIA, following World War II.
The report alleges the CIA created a "safe
haven" for Nazis believed to be of use to the US' Cold War efforts. [1]
Notice the words alleges and believed to be of use to the US' Cold War
efforts.
The report confirms, what some refer to as a pathetic chapter in our
nations history. The "experts" our intelligence people recruited were just
a bunch of criminals and losers that never provided any useful intelligence
about the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Lieutenant Richard Hallock had a
breakthrough in 1943 when he deciphered the codes of the Red Army
intelligence.
The Venona Project
One part of the report addresses the story of Otto Von Bolschwing, an
associate of Adolf Eichmann, who was instrumental in drawing up plans for
ridding Germany of Jews. [2]
Below is an excerpt by Christopher Simpson about Otto Von Bolschwing
from Simpsons
Blowback America's recruitment of Nazis,
and its disastrous effect on our domestic and foreign policy, Page 252:
The story of U.S. intelligence relations
with criminals such as Brunner is of necessity fragmentary, for both the
CIA and Brunner himself have taken extensive measures to keep such
affairs hidden. It is clear, however, that Brunner was not an exception
to the rule who managed to ingratiate himself with the Americans through
guile or through an oversight.
There is, in fact, at least one other known
case of U.S. recruitment Baron Otto Von Bolschwing, an SS veteran of
Adolf Eichmann's "Jewish Affairs" office, the elite committee that
served as the central administrative apparatus of the Nazis' campaign to
exterminate the Jews.
Notice he worked in Eichmanns elite "Jewish
Affairs" office, not in the Third Reich's elite Soviet Affairs office.
Von Bolschwing, deeply involved in
intelligence work, and in the persecution of innocent people for most of
his adult life, was a supreme opportunist who succeeded in traversing
the whole evolution of U.S. policy toward Nazi criminals. He had
profited during the war from the Nazi confiscation of Jewish property,
then later from the defeat of Nazi Germany itself. Von Bolschwing
enlisted as a CIC informer for the Americans in the spring of 1945.
Von Bolschwing joined the Nazi party at the age of twenty-three, and in
the years leading up to 1939, he was a leading Nazi intelligence agent
in the Middle East, where he worked under cover as an importer in
Jerusalem.
One of his first brushes with Nazi espionage
work, according to captured SS records, was a role in creating a covert
agreement between the Nazis and Fieval Polkes, a commander of the
militant Zionist organization Haganah, whom von Bolschwing had met
through business associates in the Mideast.
Under the arrangement the Haganah was
permitted to run recruiting and training camps for Jewish youth inside
Germany. These young people, as well as certain other Jews driven out of
Germany by the Nazis, were encouraged to emigrate to Palestine.
Polkes and the Haganah, in return, agreed to
provide the SS with intelligence about British affairs in Palestine.
Captured German records claim that Polkes
believed the increasingly brutal Nazi persecution of the Jews could be
turned to Zionist advantage - at least temporarily - by compelling Jewish
immigration to Palestine, and that the Haganah commander's sole source
of income, moreover, was secret funds from the SS.

What if there was another reason
the CIA
created a safe haven for Nazis?
Von Bolschwing, it is reasonable to assume, had access to the secret
memorandum written on June 21, 1933, from the German Zionist Federation to
the Nazis which stated in part:
All German Jewish organizations, it was
declared, should be dominated by the Zionist spirit."
In 1941, the "Stern Gang," among them Yitzhak
Shamir, later Prime Minister of Israel, presented the Nazis with the
fundamental Features of the Proposal of the National Military
Organization (NMO) in Palestine:
The NMO, which is well-acquainted with the
goodwill of the German Reich government and its authorities towards
Zionism activity
is of the opinion that: the NMO in Palestine
offers
to actively take part in the war on Germany's side.
The Iron Wall, London 1984, pp.195-197,
The Wall Street Journal December 2, 1976
Concentration werent the only camps set up by
Hitler and the Gestapo.
During the 1930s, in cooperation with the German
authorities, Zionist groups organized a network of some 40 camps where
prospective settlers were trained for their new lives in Palestine. The
Transfer Agreement between Hitlers Germany and international Zionism,
implemented in 1933 and abandoned at the beginning of WWII, allowed German
Jews to immigrate to Palestine. [3]
As an Eichmann insider in the "Jewish Affairs" office, Von Bolschwing could
have had access to other secret memoranda that would explain why the
Jew-Hating Nazis were making deals with a commander of the militant Zionist
organization
Haganah, that allowed Jews to get emigrate
to Palestine instead of being gassed in a concentration camp.
Providing a "safe haven" for Von Bolschwing and Nazis who could connect two
World Wars and
the Holocaust to the Modern State of Israel
would be a small price to pay to keep them from talking about
The Key to the Secret of the Universe.

[1] A report the Justice Department has been
trying to hide for the past four years offers the most detailed account
yet of the CIA's efforts to protect known Nazi war criminals in the
United States. Eric Lichtblau, http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/us/14nazis.html?_r=1
[2] Doctor Kubovy, from the Tel Aviv "Documentation Center", admitted in
1960,
"There is no document signed by Hitler,
Himmler or Heydrich which speaks of exterminating the Jews... and in
1981, Walter Laqueur, author of The terrible secret, admitted,
"Until now, we have never found Hitler's order to destroy the
European Jewish community, and in all probability the order was
never given."
There is no order because Hitler used the
term Entfernung of the Jews removal or expulsion.

Brenners introduction:
The Nazi era is the most discussed
period in history, yet most Jews and others are unaware of the
interaction between Zionism, Hitler and Mussolini. What happened to
the Jews is constantly utilized in Zionist propaganda as
justification for the creation of the Israeli state, the silver
lining around the dark cloud of desolation.
