U.S. Air Force Considering Building
Network of Tunnels
for Mobile Doomsday Trains.

The Air Force wants to upgrade its aging nuclear
missiles and the hundreds of underground silos that hold them.
One idea its exploring: the construction of a
sprawling network of underground subway tunnels to shuttle the missiles
around like a mobile doomsday train. As one does.
As first reported by Inside Defense,
the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center will
award several study contracts next month worth up to $3 million each to
research the idea.
A broad agency announcement from the Air Force describes the
hair-raising concept, intended to keep the weapons secure through 2075, as a
system of tunnels where nuclear missiles are shuttled around on rails or
some undefined trackless system.
The advantage of the worlds deadliest subway:
During an atomic holocaust, mobile missiles are harder for an adversary to
target than a static silo.
Missiles could be positioned at launch holes
placed at regular intervals along the length of the tunnels.
The tunnel concept mode operates similar to
a subway system but with only a single transporter/launcher and missile
dedicated to a given tunnel, stated the notice.
The tunnel is long enough to improve
survivability but leaving enough room to permit adequate rattle space
in the event of an enemy attack.
The Air Force hasnt given specifics on where
the tunnels could be built, or how long theyd need to be.
But theyll probably have to be jumbo-sized
to minimize impact from attack during all phases of
missions/operations, the notice stated.
}The Air Force requires that all
research proposals address ways to minimize likelihood that
unauthorized persons could sneak in, while keeping the system working
safely and not sacrificing the doomsday trains ability to conduct
world-wide operations.
The project would likely be gigantic, expensive
and take decades to build - all things that cut against cut against these
relatively lean times at the Pentagon.
But the U.S. silo-launched nuclear arsenal of
420 Minuteman III ballistic missiles are some of the oldest weapons
still in service with the military, and theyre only getting older.
(Not to mention the upkeep the military has to
perform on the other two legs of the nuclear triad, submarine-launched
Trident
II missiles and the air-dropped
B61 nuclear weapon.)
The Air Force has
spent
billions upgrading the Minutemans guidance systems, rocket motors and
power systems to keep them serviceable through 2030.
In a March 5 posture
statement to the House Armed Services Committee, U.S. Strategic
Command chief General Robert Kehler said the Minuteman IIIs are,
sustainable through 2030 and potentially
beyond with additional modernization investment.
But to sustain the missiles until 2075, the
service has to come up with new ideas.
The subway of doom isnt the Air Forces only
option for revamping its silos. Others include super-hardened silos, or
ground-based transporter erector launchers - really large trucks that can
haul nuclear missiles around the country, including on public roads and even
off-road.
The trucks have their downsides:
who knows how
well they can cross bridges; people would freak out if they encountered
nuclear missiles on their morning commute; and theyre way more
expensive than silos.
Last year, nuclear analyst Jeffrey Lewis estimated that building a fleet of 500 such mobile launchers
would cost about $52 billion.
Apparently,
building a 200,000 pound truck with rad-hard electronics and capable
of withstanding nuclear blast effects is expensive, he blogged.
Lewis also noted that the mobile nuclear
launchers were too expensive during the Cold War when, yknow, full-scale
nuclear war was a big threat.
Hans Kristensen, a nuclear analyst at the
Federation of American Scientists, thinks the Air Force is stuck with plain
old static silos.
The nuclear subway ICBM is, I think, a pie
in the sky and more included to have a review process entertain a range
of options so it can land on the most sensible, Kristensen tells Danger
Room.
The costs associated with developing and
operating such a system would be enormous and completely out of sync
with the fiscal realities of this nation. Even a mobile system is
probably unrealistic. I think the most likely, and probably only
realistic option short of scrapping the land-based leg of the deterrent,
is to simply extend the life of the existing Minuteman III ICBM.
Then again, maybe the Air Force defies logic and
builds the death tunnels that it says it wants.
Tomorrows Armageddon could ride to work on
rails.
