Venezuela admitted as
full member of the MERCOSUR
On June 29, 2012, Venezuela was
accepted as full member of
MERCOSUR, while Paraguay was formally
suspended due to
the June 22 putsch.
MERCOSUR is an EU-styled agreement between
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay; Venezuela had signed a membership
agreement in 2006, but was unable to join since the extremist, right-wing
Paraguayan Congress refused to ratify the agreement.
Yesterday, Paraguay was suspended until
democratic elections take place; these are planned for next year.
After the suspension, the remaining MERCOSUR
members had ratified Venezuelas joining agreement, thus in the same session
- held in Mendoza, Argentina - it was announced that Venezuelas official
inauguration to the trade bloc will take place on July 31 in Río de Janeiro,
Brazil.
Does that mean that the American-backed putsch
failed?

Paraguayan Putsch Leader
American-Backed Putsch
The Paraguayan putsch was odd since it came just a few months ahead of
general elections.
It was performed by a Machiavellian manipulation
of the Paraguayan Constitution adopted after the end of the appalling
military dictatorship of General Stroessner, who was a close ally of
the USA. After the impeachment process was begun, a new law was rushed
through to allow the lightning-fast procedure. Incredibly, the impeachment
began on Thursday and was over on Friday.
What was the rush?
President Lugo was successfully
implementing reforms that were opening the Paraguayan society, an
oligarchy run by landowners. Former American President George W. Bush
is among these.
The parliamentary putsch was initiated after the
occupation of lands by landless farmers
in Canindeyu, an area in the fertile
northeastern part of the country, ended in violent clashes with the police
on June 15.
Eleven farmers and six policemen died in the
incident.
Landowners decided to restore the old order
before it was too late.

The fact this was a putsch run by the landowners
was evident even while the parliamentary crime was being perpetrated.
Federico Franco, who was Vice President
at the moment - found time to give an outrageous interview to the CNN.
Is it true that 2% of the Paraguayan people
own 80% of the countrys lands?
The CNN reporter asked in what looked like a
question requested by Mr. Franco himself.
That is not true! 10% of the people own 80%
of the land, countered the soon to become president.
Not surprisingly, the CNN report was highly
partial; the shooting at protesters next to the Congress and the brutal
takeover of the Paraguayan Public TV by the police were not reported by the
American network.
Following the successful impeachment, the former
Vice President runs the country until the elections scheduled for next year.
The militaristic Colorado party - which in the past was led by General
Stroessner - is expected to return to power then.
The no-reaction - at least no-condemnation - of the putsch by the American
government - which on paper supports democracy - is odd, especially
considering that soon the power in Paraguay will be handed to the
militaristic party which was an important ally of the USA during
Operation Condor and other events related
to the Cold War.
One must seriously consider the option that
this was an American-backed putsch, in the best fashion of the 20th
century.
Then, there is the Bush involvement...
Bush Involved in the
Putsch?
Guarani Aquifer, Natural Gas,
and Bush Lands
It is difficult to find reliable reports on
George W. Bush land ownership in Paraguay.
The data brought here was compiled from the
British Guardian - a respectable enough source - and from various South
American media sources.
On
October 23, 2006, The Guardian reported,
Rumours of Mr. Bushs supposed forays into
South American real estate surfaced during a recent 10-day visit to the
country by his daughter Jenna Bush.
Little is known about her trip to Paraguay,
although officially she travelled with the UN childrens agency UNICEF
to visit social projects.
Jenna Bush
Photographers from the Paraguayan newspaper
ABC Color tracked her down to one restaurant in Paraguays capital
Asunción, where she was seen flanked by 10 security guards, and was also
reported to have met Paraguays president, Nicanor Duarte, and
the US ambassador to Paraguay, James Cason.
Reports in sections of the Paraguayan media
suggested she was sent on a family mission to tie up the land purchase
in the chaco.
Chaco is the name of the semi-arid lowland
divided between Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina; the first two fought a
bloody war over it in the 20th Century.
The war was encouraged by oil-companies, which
sought control over hypothetical oil fields.
Erasmo Rodríguez Acosta, the governor of
the Alto Paraguay region where Mr. Bushs new acquisition supposedly
lies, told one Paraguayan news agency there were indications that Mr.
Bush had bought land in Paso de Patria, near the border with Brazil and
Bolivia, the newspaper added.
There are reports also involving Neil Bush,
brother of the former American President, in the purchase. There is no need
to rely on newspapers; official sources also commented on the issue.
In 2006, Luis D. Elia, Undersecretary for the Social Habitat in the
Argentine Federal Planning Ministry, issued a memo partially reproduced by
digital
INFOBAE.com, in which he spoke of the purchase by Bush of a
98,842-acre farm in northern Paraguay, between Brazil and Bolivia.
He considered this Bush step counterproductive
for regional power policies expressed by Presidents,
He added that,
it is a bad signal that the Bush family is
doing business with natural resources linked to the future of MERCOSUR.
The farm is not only large; it sits atop a vast
field of natural gas. Moreover, it is near the Guaraní Aquifer, one of the
worlds largest fresh water reserves. It is so large that it could provide
100 liters of water to every human for 200 years!
As of now, the farm is inactive.

This is just another
Conspiracy Theory!
The fact that
the Bush family owns a ranch in Paraguay
doesnt make it part of a local putsch.
That is for sure; yet, there are worrying
signs that the landowners hit on democracy may have been influenced by
this case. Paraguayan newspaper Ea reported in September 2011 on an
ongoing investigation regarding the illegitimacy of the purchase.
Apparently, the farm was bought with the silent
help of the militaristic Colorado party which was in power back then. A
fence was placed all around the farm, trapping native groups inside the
area.
The farm is inactive, and thus it violates the
Paraguayan Constitution.
In other words, the land belongs to the native
groups and to the Bush family. Eventually, had the recently deposed elected
government been allowed to implement its policies, the ranch would have been
confiscated from the Bush family.
Is that a good-enough reason for an
American-backed putsch in Paraguay?
