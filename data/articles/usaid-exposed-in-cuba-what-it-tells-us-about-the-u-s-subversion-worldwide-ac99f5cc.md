Thailand
Supporters of
ousted mass murderer and dictator,
Thaksin Shinawatra
and Shinawatra himself have benefited from years of U.S.
backing, including extensive lobbying efforts in
Washington and USAID/NED funding for so-called
"activists" who attempt to pose as impartial "academics"
or "rights advocates," but clearly and
consistently
back Shinawatra and his
political machine.
It was revealed that Chiang Mai University "academic" Pinkaew
Laungaramsri and her "Book Re:public" (an
alternative book shop in Chiang Mai) was
funded by both USAID and convicted financial criminal
George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
Sawatree Suksri, of the so-called "Nitirat Group" or
"Enlightened Jurists" of Thammasat University, is
likewise deeply involved in programs run by U.S. NED.
She took part in a U.S. State Department "exchange
program," contributed to a NED Freedom House report used
annually in coordination with subversion efforts to
stack global public opinion against targeted nations,
and even hosted Thaksin Shinawatra's corporate lobbyist,
Robert Amsterdam, in the front row of one of Nitirat's
public forums.
Perhaps most troubling of all is her ties to
Thailand's Prachatai website - funded millions of
baht a year by NED, USAID, and Open Society.
Prachatai,
like those involved in the Cuban scandal, after first
denying being funded at all, now denies their work and
their extensive U.S. funding is used for anything but
"civic" programs. While they were forced to publish
their extensive U.S. funding in 2011, they have not
updated it since, nor have they ever published the
funding in Thai for their Thai readers.
They are
ceaseless proponents of Thaksin Shinawatra and his
political machine, including his so-called "red shirt"
street movement and the various disingenuous,
U.S.-funded academics described above.
Syria/Iran
In
one particular 2009 U.S. policy paper titled, "Which
Path to Persia?" by the Brookings Institution regarding
the
overthrow of Iran, it is stated specifically that:
One method that would have some
possibility of success would be to ratchet up covert
regime change efforts in the hope that Tehran would
retaliate overtly, or even semi-overtly, which could
then be portrayed as an unprovoked
act of Iranian aggression.
Here, U.S. policymakers are openly
conspiring to covertly provoke a nation through
political subversion.
The resulting "act of aggression"
would be portrayed as "unprovoked," and used to place
increasing pressure on the targeted country. The policy
paper also openly talks about the particulars
of fomenting political unrest.
Under a section called
literally, "Finding the Right Proxies" it states:
One of the hardest
tasks in fomenting a revolution, or even just
unrest, is finding the right local partners.
After openly admitting the goal of
"fomenting a revolution" or "unrest," it then details
what support to provide these proxies:
...students and other
groups need covert backing for their demonstrations.
They need fax machines. They need internet access,
funds to duplicate materials, and funds to keep
vigilantes from beating them up. Beyond this,
U.S.-backed media outlets could highlight regime
shortcomings and make otherwise obscure critics more
prominent.
The United States already supports
Persian-language satellite television (Voice of
America Persian) and radio (radio Farda) that bring
unfiltered news to Iranians (in recent years, these
have taken the lions share of overt U.S. funding
for promoting democracy in Iran).
U.S. economic
pressure (and perhaps military pressure as well)
can discredit the regime, making the population
hungry for a rival leadership.
The report also mentions the use of armed
groups supporting U.S.-engineered sedition:
Some who favor
fomenting regime change in Iran argue that it is
utopian to hold out hope for a velvet revolution.
Instead, they contend that the United States should
turn to Iranian opposition groups that already
exist, that already have demonstrated a desire to
fight the regime, and who appear willing to accept
U.S. assistance.
The hope behind this course of
action is that these various opposition groups could
transform themselves into more potent movements that
might be able to overturn the regime.
In this 2009 document, we see verbatim
the same methodologies exposed by AP in use in Cuba.
We
also see additional steps including the use of armed
groups to carry out subversion and regime change.
Such
violence was employed in the above mentioned Southeast
Asian nation of Thailand in 2009 and 2010, also
admittedly in Iran, and most obviously
in neighboring
Syria where a now 4 year war has been waged by
U.S.-backed terrorists and has devastated the
country.
Ukraine
These
elements of political subversion were also all to
be
seen in Ukraine - a nation in which America and
NATO's incessant meddling is a matter of long-standing
public record.
The Guardian would
admit in its 2004 article, "U.S.
campaign behind the turmoil in Kiev,"
that:
...while the
gains of the orange-bedecked "chestnut revolution"
are Ukraine's, the campaign is an American creation,
a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived exercise
in western branding and mass marketing that,
in four countries in four years, has been used to
try to salvage rigged elections and topple unsavory
regimes.
Funded and organized by the U.S.
government, deploying U.S. consultancies, pollsters,
diplomats, the two big American parties and U.S.
non-government organizations, the campaign was
first used in Europe in Belgrade in 2000 to beat
Slobodan Milosevic at the ballot box.
Richard Miles, the U.S. ambassador in Belgrade,
played a key role. And by last year, as U.S.
ambassador in Tbilisi, he repeated
the trick in Georgia, coaching Mikhail Saakashvili
in how to bring down Eduard Shevardnadze.
Ten months after
the success in Belgrade, the U.S. ambassador in
Minsk, Michael Kozak, a veteran of similar
operations in central America, notably in Nicaragua,
organized a near identical campaign to try to defeat
the Belarus hardman, Alexander Lukashenko.
That one failed.
"There will be no Kostunica in Belarus," the Belarus
president declared, referring to the victory in
Belgrade.
But experience
gained in Serbia, Georgia and Belarus has been
invaluable in plotting to beat the regime of Leonid Kuchma in Kiev.
The operation -
engineering democracy through the ballot box and
civil disobedience - is now so slick that the
methods have matured into a template for winning
other people's elections.
Not only has Ukraine
suffered because of this admitted U.S.-backed political
destabilization over the years, but as revealed by the
Guardian and other sources, all of Eastern Europe has
fallen prey to this brand of foreign-backed subversion,
manipulation, and regime change.
Putting an End to U.S. Subversion
America's global wrecking ball of subversion, torture
dungeons, death squads, proxy wars, and outright
military aggression is today's most pressing threat to
global stability, peace, and progress.
Wall Street and
Washington's pursuit of global hegemony has left
millions dead and entire nations in ruins.
Stopping this
enterprise requires a concerted effort by nations,
states and provinces, local communities, and individuals
themselves to begin boycotting and permanently replacing
with viable alternatives the corporate-financial
monopolies driving this destructive hegemony.
To combat political
subversion specifically, Cuba and China have set a
series of good examples.
For Cuba, ignoring the West's
"human rights" racket, constructed specifically to serve
as cover for and to protect their agents of subversion
from prosecution, has allowed them to search for and
seize incriminating evidence used to expose USAID and
their proxies thus turning Cuban public opinion against
them.
China likewise has done a masterful job exposing
the foreign ties and illegitimacy of the "Occupy
Central" movement, their true backers and their true
agenda.
For most of these
movements, they represent an obscure minority the U.S.
has attempted to artificially magnify both within their
respective countries and upon the global stage. It is
important for nations to address legitimate grievances
and to reserve searches and seizures for agents of
subversion only.
Social upheaval and perceived
injustices simply give the U.S. and its networks of
subversion a greater foothold to seize upon.
