Of all the courageous warriors for truth to whom
we pay tribute on these pages, Svali is an exception. Her name is a
pseudonym, and it is not known whether she is dead or in hiding. But her
testimony is so shocking, and of such critical importance, that in our view
it is utterly clear that we must honor her here.
Svali is, or was, an American woman born into an Illuminati bloodline.
When
she was twelve years old, she was taken to
the Vatican for a ceremony she
was told would be very important. What she witnessed - an actual child
sacrifice (the child was 3 or 4 years old, and appeared to be compliant) on
an obsidian slab over a large pentagram in a basement catacomb - is told in
her extraordinary interview with Greg Szymanski.
Everyone visiting our site
must hear this:
All Illuminati children are heavily conditioned to be obedient, patient,
self-controlled, and totally loyal to
the "family".
Some are groomed for the
military or politics; others are prepared for business - or even
'businesses' such as prostitution. Marriages are arranged, one reason being
to strengthen ties between different bloodlines.
All the members of the
families have respectable fronts as "normal" people to the degree that
no-one who is not in the group would ever suspect the duality of their
character and of their life. Meetings often occur at night. In these
meetings children are "trained" using drugs, hypnosis, and shock-reward
conditioning.
They can, in Svali's words, all handle and fire a weapon with
deadly accuracy by the age of 8.
Higher levels of politics are heavily Illuminati occupied and controlled, in
all western countries. In the United States, the population is about 1%
Illuminati or Illuminati assets. Do the math: that's about 3 million people.
You may even know some of them, and have never suspected.
Svali is also an exception in that very few Illuminati members ever leave.
The conditioning is just too great... and to leave means abandoning spouse,
parents, children, house, money, everything. Very few people make the break. Svali reports that she was only able to leave after it dawned on her that,
because she was telling lies to the Illuminati children as an Illuminati
"trainer" (her role or job in
the "family"), she must have been lied to
herself when she was young.
She converted to Christianity ('real'
Christianity: she described various Christian churches as heavily Illuminati
controlled) and this gave her the strength to leave.
She gave one major
radio interview, and had a website (suite101.com) which has now been taken
down.
She wrote prolifically for a while, but has not been heard from since
2006.
The simplest summary of the entire Illuminati agenda and net of control is
probably Henry Makow's 2002 article here. It is reproduced in "Illuminati Defector Details Pervasive Conspiracy"
