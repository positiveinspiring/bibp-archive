# U.S. Senate to Declare "International Martial Law" - Give President 
'Unlimited' Military Powers

The U.S. Senate is poised to give
President
Obama and the next
president unprecedented war powers that amount to declaring
martial law upon the entire world.
Majority leader Mitch McConnell
surprised almost everyone last week by saying
he has a war resolution ready to be voted
on at any time. The resolution is a new
authorization for use of military force (AUMF)
for declaring war on ISIS.
It would give the president even
more power than the AUMF granted
to Bush after 9/11,
which is still in place today.
"The AUMF put forward by
McConnell would not
restrict the president's use of ground troops, nor have any
limits related to time or geography.
Nor would it touch on the issue
of what to do with the 2001 AUMF, which the Obama
administration has used to attack ISIS despite that
authorization's instructions to use force against those who
planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks."
Considering what Bush and Obama did
with the 2001 AUMF:
-
invading and occupying
countries in "pre-emptive" war
-
CIA black sites
-
extrajudicial killings
-
inventing the term "enemy
combatants" to bypass international law
-
new forms of torture
-
drone bombing women and
children
-
assassinating U.S. citizens,
The specter of a new and expanded
AUMF is truly frightening.
"This resolution is a total rewrite of the War Powers Clause
in the U.S. Constitution,"
said Sen. Chris Murphy
(D-Conn).
"It is essentially a declaration of international martial
law, a sweeping transfer of military power to the president
that will allow him or her to send U.S. troops almost
anywhere in the world, for almost any reason, with
absolutely no limitations."
McConnell's resolution is more than
what Obama asked for last year, but this is of little relevance
since Obama has been carrying out a war against ISIS, including
the use of special forces, with no authorization.
The administration has refused to
put forward a legal framework, insisting that the 2001 AUMF is
enough.
As the New York Times
pointed out, ISIS was created
long after 9/11 and is actually a competitor to al Qaida, which
means that Obama's war on ISIS is not justified under the 2001
AUMF.
Even members of Congress recognize
that current military operations have no legal basis.
"I
believe the war is illegal,"
said Sen. Tim Kaine.
"I
don't think there's a legal justification for it. And I
think the greatest danger we end up doing is allowing the
president to wage a war without Congress weighing in."
Using this rationale, Tim Kaine
and others in Congress are thrilled to know that a new AUMF
could be voted on at any time.
Some would prefer more restrictions,
but the bottom line is that it represents and abdication of
constitutional duties that would give vast military powers to
one person.
Sen. John Cornyn expressed
the usual platitudes in cheering for the vote, saying,
"the
people we send in harm's way need to know that the country
is behind them" and "we
also don't need to tie the hands of the next president by
restricting what the president can do."
For some lawmakers, it's more about
giving the next president unlimited power than it
is about Obama.
McConnell's about-face from
December, when he expressed no interest in voting on an AUMF,
may also be a ploy to make the issue a major talking point in
the presidential election.
There's nothing like talk of war to
whip up fear in the masses and distract them from substantive
issues.
It is no coincidence that just days
ago, Defense Secretary Ash Carter
said about the fight against ISIS,
"We're
looking for opportunities to do more and
there will be boots on the
ground and I want to be clear about that."
Since ISIS is partially a product of
American intervention in the Middle East,
being cultivated from the Salafist sect to
foment regime change in Syria, "boots on the ground"
would complete another cycle for the merchants of death and
destruction.
The Hegelian Dialectic - create the
problem, stoke the reaction, offer the solution - is a tried and
true method for endless war...
We have already seen the extremely
tenuous connections that war-makers use to justify their death
and destruction waged around the world and on their own people.
McConnell's AUMF would clear away
any feeble barriers that still stand in the way of a military
dictatorship.
