CHAPTER 5
SCIENCE NO. 5 -
THE SKILL OF LYING,
THE ART OF DECEIT
The rule of thumb that the
programmers/handlers go by is that they will say anything to get the job
done. A CIA handler will tell his agent in the field whatever will work
to get the field agents cooperation on a mission. There is no height
nor breadth nor length to these peoples deception. They have
successfully kept some deceptions active for decades, if not for
centuries.
THE USE OF FICTION
The history behind the
Wizard of Oz programming is interesting. It suggests that the Wizard of
Oz has had an important part in the occult world all along. One of the
secrets of the Mystery Religions, especially the Egyptian Isis mystery
religion was the ability to use drugs and torture to create multiple
personalities. The word Oz is known to have been used by its author as
an abbreviation for Osirus. Monarch victims have the golden penis of Osirus placed into them. The Grimm brothers, who were cabalistic
Jews,
gathered the folk occult stories together. Their stories are full of
spells, trances, and drugs. Sleeping Beauty is put to sleep, and the
trigger to wake her is a kiss on the lips. These are serious hints that
the occult world didnt stop programming people with dissociative states
and triggers when the ancient Egyptian empires fell. Instead of using
modern lingo such as hypnotize, they would say cast a spell. Later
in Freemasonry, the Right Worshipful Master would charge (meaning
hypnotize) an initiate.
The occultist Baum, a member of the
Theosophical
Society, was inspired by some spirit who gave him the magic key to
write the Wizard of Oz book, which came out in 1900. The books
story is full of satanic activity and satanic thinking. The story was
chosen in the late 1940s to be the basis for the Illuminati/Intelligence
communitys trauma-based total mind control programming. As a way of
enhancing the effect of the programming, Monarch slaves are conditioned
to place trigger items into their lives. When the movie was made, Judy
Garland, who had lived a life touched by the occult worlds abuse, was
chosen to act as Dorothy. Judys later husband, Mickey De Vinko was a
satanist and the chief assistant to Roy Radin, a rich satanist who
worked with the Illuminati, and who controlled the Process church
covens which had as members mass murderers Berkowitz and Monarch slave
Charlie Manson. There are several members of the Carr family, who are
also tied into both De Vinko and Radins Process Church and the
Illuminati.
With the numerous long term connections between the
Wizard of Oz books, and movie to the highest levels of the occult
world, it is not without reason that one can theorize that the original
series of 14 Oz books had an ulterior motive behind them.
The 14 books
of the Oz series are:
1) The Wizard of Oz,
2) The Land of Oz,
3) Ozma of Oz,
4) Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,
5) The
Road to Oz,
6) The Emerald City of Oz,
7) The Patchwork Girl of Oz,
8) Tik-tok of Oz,
9) The Scarecrow of Oz,
10) Rinkitink in Oz,
11) The Lost Princess of Oz,
12) The Tinman Woodsman of
Oz,
13) The Magic of Oz,
14) Glinda of Oz.
These books
are still being sold, and are being read to children who are being
programmed with trauma-based total mind control. The 14 books came out
in various editions. The originals came out in 1900 and shortly
thereafter. In the 1930s, the 1940s, and the 1950s the words
were retype set and given different pages. (When working with a survivor
it might help to identify what decade the edition the slave was
programmed with, because the pictures and the page numbers varied from
edition to edition.)
Of course, having good pictures is an asset in
programming, because the child will visualize off of the pictures when
building its internal world. In addition to this, large Wizard of Oz
theme parks are being built by the Illuminati to provide places to carry
out programming and to reinforce the programming which traps the minds
of Monarch slaves. The best example of this, is the audacious MGM Grand
complex in Las Vegas, although other theme parks around America also use
a Wizard of Oz theme. If you have read Fritz Springmeiers Be Wise As
Serpents you will know how the Theosophical Society ties in with
Freemasonry, Satanism, and
Lucis Trust.
Several famous members of the
Theosophical Society include:
-
Adolf Hitler (a Satanist who practiced human sacrifice, & who had HPBs
book at his side)
-
Mahatma Gandhi (a Hindu guru considered a god by some of his followers.
Gandhi was successful with the British in part because of the
Theosophical Society)
-
H.P. Blavatsky (The founder of the Theosophical Society. She referred to
herself as HPB. She was initiated by Illuminatus Mazzini into
Carbonarism , a form of Freemasonry, illumined by the Great White Lodge
in 1856, was part of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, and spent lots
of time with the Eddy Illuminati family in Vermont, who were well known
mediums. She also was a member of the occult fraternities the Order of
the Druses, the Adoptive branch of the Ancient & Primitive Rite of
Freemasonry, & the hermetic masonic rites of Memphis and Mizraim. She
was trained to handle live snakes by Sheik Yusuf ben Makerzi, the chief
of the Serpent Handlers, and she was hypnotized by occultist Victor Michal and to some degree from 1866 under his influence.)
-
Alice Bailey (head of
Lucis Trust)
-
Henry Steel Olcott (an important occultist)
-
Elvis Presley (a
Monarch slave)
-
Manly P. Hall (an Illuminati Theta Programmer, and at least a Grand
Master within the Illuminati who sat on the Grand Druid Council.)
Frank Baum
The man who wrote the
book The Wizard of Oz was a member of the Theosophical Society.
L. Frank Baum lived in South Dakota and created The Wizard of Oz
book as a theosophical fairy tale incorporating the ancient wisdom of
the Mystery Religions. The books have so much material from inside the
secret world of the Illuminati, that the few who understand the
Illuminati wonder if Baum wasnt an insider. The moral of the book is
that we must rely upon ourselves, for we alone have the power to save
ourselves. This was part of the original lie of Satan in the garden.
Satan has simply dressed up the same original lie into different
packaging and is distributing it worldwide as the most popular American
fairy tale. L. Frank Baum explained how he came to write the book,
It
was pure inspiration.... It came to me right out of the blue. I think
that sometimes the Great Author has a message to get across and He has
to use the instrument at hand. I happened to be that medium, and I
believe the magic key was given me to open the doors to sympathy and
understanding, joy, peace and happiness.
(Hearn, Michael P. ed., The
Annotated Wizard of Oz. NY: Clarkson N. Potter, 1973, p. 73.)
In
Baums time, the head of the Theosophical Society, H.P. Blavastsky had
been putting out her journal called Lucifer. In other words, I
highly suspect Baum knew what the Theosophical Society was all about,
and that he himself was deeply into the occult. The book The Wizard
of Oz came out in 1900. (It wasnt until 1939 that the movie was
made.) This next section will cover the numerous parallels between the
Wizard of Oz material and the occult world and the occult worlds
programming. This is broken up into 3 sections:
PARALLELS BETWEEN:
A. THE WIZARD OF OZ BOOK &
OCCULTISM
B. THE WIZARD OF OZ MOVIE &
ILLUMINATI RITUALS
C. THE WIZARD OF OZ SERIES
OF BOOKS AND MONARCH PROGRAMMING
For those readers who are
unfamiliar with the occult world, some of these parallels at first may
seem stretched. When one sees how many parallels there are, then occult
nature of the books begins to sink in. The authors could provide the
reader with more parallels between Satanism and The Wizard of Oz
book, but we believe the following will suffice. (Some parallels may
also apply to the movie.)
A.THE WIZARD OF OZ
BOOK & OCCULTISM
-
Auntie Em represents HP Blavastskys Mulaprakriti
and Uncle Henry represents HPBs Unmanifested Logos.
-
The carnival huckster (later seen as the Wizard) is advertised as being
connected to the royal families of Europe. The Royal families of Europe
are secret Satanists, from powerful occult bloodlines.
-
Dorothy is brought to Oz by a cyclone. The word cyclone originally was
the greek word cyclone which means both a circle or the coil of a snake.
In other words, the snake takes Dorothy to Oz.
-
Dorothys three companions represent the mental, emotional, and physical
bodies that HPB wrote about. Dorothy acquired these three companions
just as Theosophy says we will when we come into incarnation. To quote
HPB There is no danger that dauntless courage cannot conquer; there is
not trial that spotless purity cannot pass through; there is no
difficulty that strong intellect cannot surmount. (Algeo, John. The
Wizard of Oz: The Perilous Journey, The Quest, Summer 1993.
Wheaton, Il.: Theosophical Society in Amer.,p. 53.)
-
In the book, the Tin Woodsman was an ordinary being
of flesh, but a wicked witch casts a spell on him. He kept chopping off
parts of his body, which were then replaced by a tinsmith, until he
became the first bionic man, with a completely mechanic body. Boy,
hasnt the Illuminati been trying to do this one!?
-
In step with Wizard of Oz mind-control programming, the wicked witch &
naughty children cannot stand water but dissolve. Robotic clones are
created in the minds of Monarch slaves which can only be mentally
dissolved by mentally placing water on them.
-
Dorothy goes questing in Oz. Theosophists (New Agers, Satanists, etc.)
go on quests.
-
Oz is shaped like a Mandala with Emerald City in the center, an
impassable barrier, four-sidedness, 4 symbolic colors, the circle and
the center. The colors and directions given in Oz may also have other
symbolic meanings in the occult. For instance, Emerald City is green and
green is the fourth point of the Eastern Star (womens Freemasonry) &
Satans color. A The route that Dorothy follows in Oz has the shape of a
T with its 3 points defining an inverted triangle.
-
The Yellow Brick Road suggests gold, the perfect metal. Gold is
considered to be divine & the source of wisdom by the Illuminati. HPB
had written There is a Road, steep and thorny, beset with perils of
every kind, but yet a Road, and it leads to the very heart of the
universe. This was the yellow brick road that Baum the Theosophist
sought to portray in his fairy tale. The book contains a great deal more
perils and adventures on the road than the movie.
-
The article shows that the great teacher
is a humbug but Dorothy and her own companions have the abilities to
help themselves if they only will realize their own powers through the
help of the good witch of the south. This is in line with the
Theosophical Societys, the Church of Satans, and other occult groups
teachings which teach that the individual has the capabilities within
themselves to achieve anything. One of the Theosophical Societys
publications states, Prepare thyself, for thou wilt have to travel on
alone. The teacher can but point the way. (The Voice of Silence
as quoted in The Wizard of Oz article, Quest, Summer, 1993
p. 54.) Part of the mind set of Satanism is that reality and
fantasy become blurred. This blurring has been part of the brainwashing
that is being systematically given to American children.
Within Monarch
slaves they have an incredibly difficult time trying to differentiate
between reality and fantasy because of all the mind programming they
have been subjected too. There are several techniques which will
determine for Monarch survivors if their memories are real. In the board
game called Illuminati!, put out by people connected to the
Illuminati, the game states, Dont believe any of this, it is all
true. These are the type of double-bind self contradictory statements
that Satanists love to spew out. Monarch slaves are programmed full of
double-binds. With the Satanists penchant for blurring reality in mind,
read the following quote where the President of the Theosophical Society
admiringly describes the Wizard of Oz, Part of Baums joke is that
things are never what they seem.
Dorothy seems to be a simple and
harmless little girl, but it is she who kills the wicked witches of both
East and West. The Scarecrow seems to lack brains, but he has all the
ideas in the company. The Tin Woodman seems to lack a heart, but he is
so full of sentiment that he is always weeping. The Cowardly Lion seems
to be a coward, but he takes brave action whenever it is called for. The
Wizard seems to be great and powerful, but he is actually a humbug. Oz
seems to be a glorious and delightful land and Kansas to be dry, gray,
and dull--but Oz is a world of illusion and Kansas is really home.
Things are not what they seem, in Oz or Kansas.
B. RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN THE MOVIE &
ILLUMINATI RITUAL
-
The close relationship between Dorothy
and her dog is a very subtle connection between the satanic cults use of
animals (familiars). Those who read Vol. 1, may remember the example
written about on how Illuminati Kingpin Alfred I. du Ponts dog Mummy
served as Alfreds familiar spirit. Animals are very often used in
ritual. This connection is very subtle, perhaps too subtle for it to be
worthy of mention, except that those in Satanism will see the
significance, even though others wont. What is trivial to one person
may not be to the next. A Monarch slave as a child will be allowed to
bond with a pet. The child will want to bond with a pet anyway because
people are terrifying by this point. Then the pet is killed in porn to
traumatize the child. This
happens quite frequently.
-
The Rainbow--with its seven colors have long had an occult significance
of being a great spiritual hypnotic device. Constance Cumbey, in her
book The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, which exposes the New Age
Occult Movement, correctly writes, The Rainbow (also called the
Antahkarana or Rainbow Bridge). This is used as a hypnotic device.,,
(p.261) The Supreme Council of the 33rd0 of Freemasonry has
used the rainbow on the cover of their magazine. In a book teaching
Druidism (as in Illuminati Druidism), The 21 Lessons of Meryln, the Rainbow is described as A true sign of Magic...it exists in both
worlds at once!
-
Elvira Gulch is a woman who owns 1/2 of the county where Dorothy lives
in Kansas. She is shown later in the Land of Oz transformed as a witch.
Many of the Illuminati elite are rich and lead double lives. People who
meet them at a ritual will see the dark side of these rich people. At
the rituals, people are tranced from drugs, chanting, and mind control;
they are over the rainbow.
-
Professor Marvel uses a crystal ball which he claims was used by the
Priests of Isis. Isis and Osirus are both part of the Ancient Egyptian
Mystery religion and modern Satanism.
-
Kansas is black & white, Oz is in color.
Reality is downplayed in witchcraft and satanism. Make believe is
considered more colorful than reality.
Also as an escape from this world,
Satanists use drugs to enhance their perception of colors. Some of the
famous writers took drugs which put them into altered states of
consciousness in order to release their creativity.
-
Both good and bad witches in Oz carry staffs. In Satanism & the
Illuminati, Priestesses also carry similar staffs. Also the idea that
there are good and evil witches -- white and black magic is straight
from the occult, and follows the Illuminatis gnostic beliefs.
-
Several scenes involve transference of power via transference of
slippers from a witch. In Illuminati ritual, to transfer power, a
Matriarch, or Mother of Darkness will kill the person in a position of
authority with a strike on the forehead with a special mace like staff,
and then put on their slippers. Ruby colored slippers are actually used
as a symbol of authority at the Matriarch level in the Illuminati. The
shoes are said to be golden at the Mothers of Darkness level in the
Illuminati.
-
The bad witch uses poison, poisoned apples and poisoned brew. Satanic
covens in real life do this same thing.
-
The wizard is portrayed as someone who rules and is benevolent. In
witchcraft, wizards do rule (even though in some groups wizards are
simply called witches.)
-
Winged monkeys in the haunted forest, harken back to the pagan cultures
which placed wings on various animal idols.
-
The trees are alive like animals in the film. The Illuminati believe
that the trees have spirits. In one of the Oz films, even the stones
have personality and talk. This comes straight out of Druidism.
-
The Tin Man is a person which has been part of Illuminati ceremonies.
The first initial ceremony that children of the Illuminati may remember
is where a Tin Man with an ax watches over their presentation to the
coven.
-
If the parent presents the child, nothing
is done, but if
the parent refuses to present the children, then the Tin Man in the
ritual will use his axe to sever the childs head on a chopping block.
(The Tin Man will also appear in Tin Man programming, and a Tin Mans
Castle may well be built in the Monarch slaves head, but the point here
is that the Tin Man is also part of ritual.)
-
Dorothy kills the wicked witch of the
west by a sharp blow to the forehead with the witchs staff.
This is what is done in the
Illuminati, when an elderly witch is being replaced. In both cases,
whether in the movie or in real life in the Illuminati, when a witch is
killed the people have a ceremony. In real life in the secret world of
the Illuminati, a scroll is used to certify that the witch is dead both
physically and spiritually. (The movie had this in it.) Just one example
of the thousands of Illuminati Grande Dames killed in ritual like this
is the recent billionaires Dorris Duke, who was ritually killed in 1993
on Halloween, also called All Hallows Eve, in the Beverly Hills, CA
area. The Illuminati method for killing a Grande Dame and passing her
spiritual power on is done with reverence. No blood is to be spilt out
of respect for the elderly woman who gives up her life willingly.
At
death, the last breath is inhaled by the replacement to transfer the
power. There may be as many as 2,197 Grande Dames at such a coronation.
The Grande Mothers (whose Systems are mistresses for Satan and hierarchy
leaders) and the next rank, the Grande Dames, are often veiled in ritual
and would wear robes with different colored lining. The different colors
of linings show the different grades. A typical Grande Mother vestment
or robe is a black satin & velvet dress with a draped neckline, and
ritual symbols down the center of the robe. After someone like Dorris
Duke willingly gives her (their) life, her head is served on a silver
platter at a banquet. For the deeper alters of a high level slave, this
is part of their way of life; they are told it is
their birthright and heritage. Such alters will not be able to identify
with the culture at large. To give up their programming, means giving up
their magickal powers and their culture, which they have had to work
hard for.
To leave they would need to see something that they
perceive as better. They are locked into their slavery due do to their
exposure to only a secret Illuminati culture and value system. Because
of their dissociation with the rest of their own System of alters, they
dont perceive a need to change their lifestyle anymore than a Bushman
would be able to feel a need to wear shoes. Why should the Bushman want
shoes, if he has gotten along without them? Why should a high level
slave want change, when they have gotten along without it? Experience
shows that during deprogramming most of the lower level alters will want
to escape their abuse, but the higher level ritual alters are so
separated from the abuse they dont want to give up their status and
culture.
-
Throughout the movie, scrolls are used. As stated,
Moriah continues to
use scrolls for their official ritual functions.
-
The wicked witch of the west says that her question was not to kill or
not to kill Dorothy?, but rather HOW to kill Dorothy for these things
must be done delicately. This is exactly the attitude displayed within
the Illuminati.
-
The film has occult items such as crystal balls in several scenes,
haunted castles, magic and a benevolent wizard.
-
At one point the Lion says, I do believe in spooks [ghosts], I do, I
do, I do, I do. (Today, intelligence agents are also called spooks.)
-
The Lion, Tinman, Dorothy and the Scarecrow must prove themselves worthy
to receive the benevolence from Oz. The occult is full of rituals where
the participant must prove himself worthy.
-
The phrase seeds of learning is used in Illuminati ceremonies. Staffs
like the movie has are used by various occult groups. These staffs often
serve as stun guns, so that shocks can be applied during ceremonies. The
shocks may be applied so that the victim doesnt remember the ceremony.
C. PARALLELS BETWEEN THE
WIZARD OF OZ SERIES OF BOOKS AND MONARCH PROGRAMMING
The following are parts of
the Wizard of Oz Monarch Programming, which is a base programming put in
when the child is very young. Some of the slaves know portions of the
Wizard of Oz script word-for-word.
-
Dorothy is told she doesnt have a brain if she has gotten into trouble.
-
Dorothy is looking for a place where
there is no trouble which is a place over the rainbow. To escape pain,
alters go over the rainbow.
(This is a.k.a. in Alice In Wonderland
Programming as going through the looking glass.
-
Dorothy becomes unconscious, the world begins spinning, and then she see
disjointed pictures. This also happens to Monarch slaves. Later in the
film, Dorothy states, My! people come and go so quickly. This is
exactly what happens to the Monarch slave whose multiple personalities
come and go. When the multiple personalities switch in and out very fast
a spinning process can start which can be dangerous if it doesnt stop.
Just like most hiccuping stops on its own, the rapid uncontrolled
switching (which can be triggered by stress) usually stops on its own.
Systems which subconsciously know they are going to be tortured and used
may out of a subconscious fear begin this revolving switching. It is
said that the Monarch victim will become comatose if the rapid spinning
goes on too long. Personalities are switched in what are called tornado
spins or tornado spinning and personalities called spin off
personalities come up according to the number of revolutions the slave
is commanded to spin. By spinning the slave, the master can choose what
sexual perversion he wants as each spin off personality has been
trained to carry out a different perversion.
-
Over the rainbow in Oz is for the Monarch
slave to be in a trance, and into a certain area of the programming. To
be fluctuating at both ends as an observer and not a participant or to
go to the other extreme and become a participant.
The theme song of the movie goes,
Somewhere over the Rainbow... theres a land where the dreams that you
dare to dream really come true. These lyrics are a method to
hypnotically confuse the brain to perceive that the over the Rainbow
experience (which is usually horrible abuse) is a dream. The
dissociative mind is only too happy to call the trauma a dream, which is
lived as a reality for a moment, but is nevertheless recorded by the
mind as a fantasy. The term for this is cryptoamnesia, which means the
process where the proper functioning of memory is hypnotically messed
up. The slaves internal world becomes reality and the external real
world becomes the Land of Oz which is perceived as make-believe.
-
Dwarfs are used in the internal programming. (Hollywood hired a large
number of them for the movies cast. They are called Munchkins in the
movie.) Mengele, known as the programmer Dr. Green, was especially
interested in experimenting traumas on dwarfs.
-
For bona-fides & recognition signals, the Monarch slaves wear diamonds
to signify they are presidential models, rubies to signify their Oz
programming for prostitution, and emeralds to signify their programming
to do drug business. Rings are also used to signify what activity the
slave is doing, and what rank or level they are in the occult.
-
Monarch slaves are taught to follow the
yellow brick road. No matter what fearful things lie ahead, the Monarch
slave must follow the Yellow Brick Road which is set out before them by
their master. For some slaves used as track stars, their Yellow Brick
Road was the track they had to run.
The Yellow Brick Road is the runway in
which alters were trained to fly off from to exit their internal world
and take the body. The Yellow Brick Road also pertains to the assignment
that an alter is given. To follow the Yellow Brick Road is to go down
the road that has been assigned by command. The Yellow Brick Road
programming is placed into the childs mind via the Yellow Brick Road of
the Wizard of Oz story. Remember the key words, Follow the Yellow Brick
Road.
To get someone onto the Yellow Brick Road you must know the
access code to get them through the poppy field. The color codes are
important to get an alter through the field of poppies. Fiddler is
important word to get to the yellow brick road (it signifies the
programmer in the context of the programmer is here, go over the
rainbow) and then the alters eat what is variously called MUSIC or a
SCRIPT or A LETTER which are words meaning instructions. In the 1900
edition of the book on page 31-32 says (programming cues are in caps),
She closed the door, locked it, and put the KEY carefully in the pocket
of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, SHE
STARTED ON HER JOURNEY. THERE WERE SEVERAL ROADS NEAR BY, BUT IT DID NOT
TAKE HER LONG TO FIND THE ONE PAVED WITH YELLOW BRICK. Within a short
time she was walking briskly toward the EMERALD CITY, HER SILVER SHOES
tinkling merrily on the hard, YELLOW ROADBED.
The sun shone BRIGHT AND
THE BIRDS SANG SWEET and Dorothy did not feel nearly as bad as you might
think a little girl would who had been SUDDENLY WHISKED AWAY FROM HER
OWN COUNTRY AND SET DOWN IN THE MIDST OF A STRANGE LAND....The houses of
the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings,...ALL WERE PAINTED BLUE, for
in this country of the EAST BLUE WAS THE FAVORITE COLOR.. .FIVE LITTLE
FIDDLERS PLAYED AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AND
SINGING, while a big table nearby was loaded with DELICIOUS FRUITS [the
programs] and NUTS, PIES, and cakes, and many OTHER GOOD THINGS TO EAT
[scripts to ingest].
-
Monarch slaves are threatened with fire,
like the Scarecrow. They also see people dismembered like the Scarecrow
was dismembered. For them it is not an idle threat.
The front alters also have hearts full of
pain like Scarecrow.
-
Certain alters are not given courage and most have their hearts taken
from them. The alters who are programmed not to have hearts are
hypnotically told the same thing the Tin Man says, I could be human if
I only had a heart. (See Chapter 4, where it discusses hypnosurgery.)
-
Some alters are taught they are stupid and have no brain. Scarecrow is
asked the question, How can you talk without a brain? Scarecrow
answers, Some people without a brain can do a lot of talking.
-
Emerald City is used in programming. Emerald City in the programming
will be well guarded and hard to reach. Several important things will be
placed inside the Emerald City, including the deeper Illuminati alters.
-
Castles are used in the programming. Lots of castles, either in the
minds imagery or purely demoniac are placed into the slaves mind.
-
Winged monkeys are able to watch in the movies somewhat as spy
satellites. Winged monkeys are used in the programming to create a fear
of always being watched.
-
The Flowers used in the movie and books, are also used in the
programming. The witch uses poppy flowers to put the lion and Dorothy to
sleep. Opium and cocaine are used to tranquilize Monarch slaves. An
alter of a slave will get trancy when they enter the poppy field.
(Heroin and cocaine come from poppies.) In the film, Dorothy says, What
is happening? Im so sleepy. She and the lion get sleepy for no
apparent reason very quickly. Monarch slaves do the same thing. Waking
up with snow in the movie is nothing less than an allusion to cocaine
which is a common substance given to Monarch slaves to help make them
dependent.
-
Dorothy states at one point in the movie that she doesnt remember.
She then follows this up with I guess it doesnt matter.
-
Hour glasses appear in the movie in
several spots, and they also occur in various contexts in people who
have been programmed by the Monarch programming. Some victims of the
programming have hour glass configurations each created around a
separate axis. The hour glasses have the ability to be rotated which
causes certain alters to be brought forward.
Monarch slave masters have also used hour
glasses to indicate to their slaves that death was imminent and that
time was running out. This is the way the wicked witch used the hour
glass on Dorothy, who happens to be saved just as the hour glass runs
out. Some Monarch slave masters actually have large hour glasses
(sometimes 3 high) like in the movie. (In Cathy OBriens autobiography
of her life as a Monarch slave
Transformation of America she has
a photograph of Sec. of Defense Cheneys hour glass on his desk with him
seated. This hour glass was used to threaten her as a slave.)
When a
Monarch slave sees an hour glass they may switch, but basically it is a
reminder that the slave masters have the power to run a persons time
out. One slave was told, The sand that sifts through the hourglass is a
measure of your worthiness to live or die. The hour glass shape is
basically two triangles which touch at their peaks, or an X
configuration with the tops of the X having lines. The childs mind is
to visualize this configuration as a compass, as the four points N, S,
E, W, they are to see the X configuration also as an x, y axis upon
which a city is structured. The hour glass then is tied to several other
concepts which integrate themselves well with the basic X shape of the
hour glass. Circles with Xs are stacked on top of each other to form
the different worlds which contain the alters.
The two pie shaped pieces
of the hour glass will hold one world, while the hour
glass configuration made by the other two adjacent pieces hold the
looking glass mirror images of each alter. Each hour glass is called 2
quadrants. To remove 4 quadrants would of course take both alters and
mirror images with it. In mathematics, it could be stated that
regular alters are in quadrant x,y and -x, -y. And that the looking
glass people--the mirror images, early splits made from each alter as a
copy, are in quadrants -x, y and x, -y. (See the chapter on how to
structure a System)
-
Click your heels together and be there in a snap is both in the movie
and in the programming cues. Military Monarch slave models are
especially taught to click their heels together. (Joseph Mengele,
Dr.
Black, Michael Aquino and others also liked to click their Nazi boots
together while they programmed children.)
-
SILENCE! is both in the movie and a command of the Oz Programming.
This word SILENCE stands for a code of no talk which runs deep in the
mind of the slave.
-
As in the movie, certain slave alters will talk to their masters as
Dorothy did, If you please, Sir...
-
The keys (and triggers) to control the switching of personalities and to
give orders are frequently based on Wizard of Oz material. A Monarch
slave owner might use cues based on the Wizard of Oz such as
-
THERES A PAIR OF MAGIC
SHOES TO WEAR WITH YOUR DRESS...SOMETHING IN LIGHTENING...TO TRANSPORT
YOU FASTER THAN THE OL RUBY SLIPPERS. (Quote from OBrien, Cathy.
Operation Carrier Pigeon, Monograph, pg. 2.) A cryptic death threat
given to Cathy as a slave by handler Sec. of Defense Cheney to kill her
daughter by taking off her daughters ears was then backed up by the
hypnotic command based on Wizard of Oz programming, ILL GET HER, MY
PRETTY. . .YOUR LITTLE GIRL.
-
The programming that is related to the Tin Man produces a monarch slave
which is
-
described as A WELL OILED
MACHINE by the handlers. U.S. Sen. Allen Simpson, one of the
perpetrators of the Monarch Program, referred to the Tin Man programming
when he told a slave THESE ARE BUT EMPTY SHELLS OF THE LIFE THEY WERE
ONCE POSSESSED. LIKE YOU ARE--EMPTY AND VOID OF LIFE.
-
Phrases like troubles melt can be found in both the movie and in the
programming.
Lets now cover what
programming is based on the Oz books, that isnt found in the movie. A
great deal of the Oz programming comes from the books, of which only the
first book was used for the movie. The public is familiar with the movie
which is based on the first one, but in general doesnt know the other
books exist. We will not go
through the scripts of all 14 books--there isnt room for that, but by
going through a few of the books, the reader will begin to see the
massive amount of material which was used for programming scripts in the
Oz books. It is one thing to say, the Wizard of Oz was used as a
mind-control programming script, but that doesnt convey the extent of
it. Large sections of the 14 books are almost perfect for mind-control.
If you take the trouble to read these quotes, you may find yourself
startled at what you thought at first glance was a nice child story!
pg. 38 Book 1 The Wizard of Oz,
That is true, said the Scarecrow. You see,
he continued, confidently, I DONT MIND MY LEGS AND ARMS AND BODY BEING
STUFFED, BECAUSE I CANNOT GET HURT. IF ANYONE TREADS ON MY TOES OR
STICKS A PIN INTO ME, IT DOESNT MATTER, FOR I CANT FEEL IT. This is
teaching dissociation. The slaves actually do have pins & needles stuck
into them, or toothpicks under their fingernails, etc. If anyone asks
the slave a question they can say according to the script, I dont know
anything. The infant slave will be taught words like this STICKS &
STONES MAY BREAK MY BACK, BUT WORDS WILL NEVER HURT ME, BECAUSE IM NOT
HERE.
pg. 41 Book 1 The Wizard
of Oz, It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick him up
and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing merrily
at his own mishap. This is teaching the programming ITS O.K., IT
DOESNT MATTER, NOTHING WRONG HERE that the slave is taught to tell the
world.
pg. 40 Book 1 The Wizard
of Oz, nest of rats in the straw, ...at the scarecrow. The mice in
a Monarch System which control the turning of the quadrants clock, hide
from the scarecrow. pg. 42 Book 1 The Wizard of Oz, fewer fruit
trees... If the slave eats the fruit [code for programs] without
permission, the dwarf munchkins will beat the alter with their clubs.
Also on this page HOME is called KANSAS, and it is described as how
gray everything was there. In other words, reality isnt as great and
colorful as the make believe internal world you can build in your mind
to escape this hell were giving you.
pg. 43 Book 1 The Wizard
of Oz, The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered, My
life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was only
made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that time
is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the
first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going
on. This is the script read to new alters, to help them have a clean
slate before programming them with another new script. This is coupled
with the Wizard of Oz theme that the Wizard gives brains (what to think)
to the Scarecrow. The alters are hypnotically programmed that if they
think on their own--then they are empty headed like the Scarecrow. They
can only have something in their head if they let the Wizard give them
what to think.
pg. 45 Book 1 The Wizard
of Oz, It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,
having been made such a little while before. This is part of the script
read a new alter.
pg. 48 Book 1 The
Wizard of Oz, So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they
reached the cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves
in one corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her, soon fell
into a sound sleep. the Scarecrow who was never tired, stood up in
another corner and waited...
This was used to program part of a script
for an Illuminati ceremony.
pg. 57 Book 1 The
Wizard of Oz, So the old woman went to the wicked Witch of the
East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the
marriage. Therefore, upon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I
was chopping away...the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.
This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man
could not do very well as a woodchopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had
him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was
used to it; but my action angered the wicked Witch of the East, for she
had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl.
When I began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg.
Again I went to the tinner, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After
this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but,
nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The wicked Witch
then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that
was the end of me. But the tinner happened to come along, and he made me
a new head out of tin. This is an Illuminati ceremony script done by
Dr. Mengele with children at a very young age. It was a blood oath to
Green that if they let anyone touch the programming they would cut
themselves.
pg. 58 Book 1 The
Wizard of Oz, ...splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinner
came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms...But
alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin
girl... I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was
the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and
so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one.
pg. 66 Book 1 The
Wizard of Oz, The Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and Dorothy expect
that the Wizard of Oz can give a brain, a heart, and send Dorothy back
to Kansas. Under
programming the Master as the Wizard can give alters what he wants
including sending them back to Kansas (their internal reality). pg. 77
Book 1 The Wizard of Oz, ...they could see the road of yellow
brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted
with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of
delicious fruits. This is used for the imagery of the yellow brick
road.
pg. 87 Book 1 The Wizard
of Oz, Scarlet poppies...their odor is so powerful that anyone who
breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from
the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did
not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that
were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she
must sit down to rest and to sleep. This is an important part of the
programming. This is the story line for trancing deep. pg. 112 Book 1
The Wizard of Oz, Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own
glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace. Taking a
big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate, and they
all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald
City. This is helpful imagery in setting up the internal Emerald City
and its guards.
BOOK 3. OZMA OF OZ
pg. 20 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
But the wind, as if satisfied at last with its mischievous pranks,
stopped blowing this ocean and hurried away to another part of the world
to blow something else; so that the waves, not being joggled any more,
began to quiet down and behave themselves. Used to create protective
programming, notice how the wind is personified.
pg. 23 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
So she sat down in a corner of the coop, leaned her back against
the slats, nodded at the friendly stars before she closed her eyes, and
was asleep in half a minute. Alters may be trained to trance when
placed in a corner.
pg. 27 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, No, indeed; I never care to hatch eggs unless Ive a nice
snug nest, in some quiet place, with a bakers dozen of eggs under me.
Thats thirteen, you know,
and its a lucky number for hens. So you may as well eat this egg. This
has been used often to get 13 splits when torturing. Many Illuminati
Systems were set up on 13 grids.
pg. 30 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
Next to the water [programming cue to build Atlantis] was a broad
beach of white sand and gravel [programming cue to build Troy], and
farther back were several rocky hills, while beyond these appeared a
strip of green trees [programming cue to build a green forest] that
marked the edge of a forest. But there were no houses to be seen, nor
any sign of people [programming cue for alters to be invisible] who
might inhabit this unknown land. This page along with others near it,
have been used to build the structures in the internal world of
Illuminati slaves. In brackets are a sample of how it could be used when
building an internal world.
pg. 34 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
Why eating live things....You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Goodness me! returned the hen, in a puzzled tone; how queer you are,
Dorothy! Live things are much fresher and more wholesome than dead ones,
and you humans eat all sorts of dead creatures. This is used to
encourage cannabalism.
pg. 35 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, ...a large sized golden key. To encourage the imagery of
golden keys, which are used frequently in the internal system. The next
chapter Letter in the Sand has singing trees in it, which have been
popular items for the Illuminati due to their druid beliefs.
pg. 39 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, Bye, bye, and bye, when she was almost in despair, the
little girl came upon two trees that promised to furnish her with plenty
of food. One was quite full of square paper boxes, which grew in
clusters on all the limbs, and upon the biggest and ripest boxes the
word Lunch could be read, in neat letters. The tree seemed to bear all
the year around, for there were lunch-box blossoms on some of the
branches, and on others tiny little lunch-boxes that were as yet quite
green, and evidently not fit to eat.
Boxes are built internally in the slaves
mind and a box will contain a program. The food is the programming that
the slave is to eat and digest. The programming in the box might be
songs, nursery rhymes, or a poem or anything. (On page 41, there is a
full page picture of a girl picking a lunch-pail from a tree limb to eat
it.)
pg. 40 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
The little girl stood on tip-toe and picked one of the nicest and
biggest lunch-boxes, and then she sat down upon the ground and eagerly
opened it. Inside she found, nicely wrapped in white papers, a ham
sandwich, a piece of sponge-cake, a pickle, a slice of new cheese and an
apple. Each thing had a separate stem,... The lunch-boxes on the tree
are the programs which the programmers put in. The stems are what link
the programming stories together in the childs mind.
pg. 42 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
I had a pair of silver shoes, that carried me through the air.
..said Dorothy. In the programming silver shoes are used as cues to go
into altered states (i.e. through the air.)
pg. 44 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
embroidered garments of many colors Color programming for the
ribbons.
pg. 47 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
Well get you in time, never fear! And when we do get you, well
tear you into little bits. Why are you so cruel to me? asked Dorothy.
Im a stranger in your country, and have done you no harm. No harm!
cried one who seemed to be their leader. Did you not pick our
lunch-boxes and dinner pails? Have you not a stolen dinner-pail still in
your hand?...it is the law here that whoever picks a dinner-pail without
our permission must die immediately. The programming message to all of
this is that no one had better touch the dinner-pails which represent
the programs or they are to die immediately. Armies like in the story
guard the internal programming of the slave.
pg. 51 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
these pages describe a crack in rocks that is a door. This is used
for Petra programming.
pg. 52 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, golden key...within the narrow chamber of rock was the
form of a man--or, at least, it seemed like a man...his head and limbs
were copper. Also his head
and limbs were copper, and these were jointed or hinged to his body in a
peculiar way, with metal caps over the joints, like the armor worn by
knights in days of old. These are a Systems robots which are said by
the programmers to be friends, and which are invisible. You can see
other peoples robots but not ones own internal robots.
pg. 53 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, This copper man is not alive at all. The clone robots are
made to think they are not alive, but just robots. In reality they are
little child alters suited up to think they are robots.
pg. 55 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, ...back view of the copper man, and in this way discovered a
printed card that hung between his shoulders, it being suspended from a
small copper peg at the back of his neck. The robots are put in by a
combination of several stories. The deep sea divers of 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea, and the Wizard of Ozs Copper Man reinforce each other.
Extra Responsive Mechanical man fitted with our
special clock-work attachment. Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything

sign is part of the robotic programming the clone robots receive. Notice
that they are drilled into total obedience--all infringements will be

pg. 56 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
DIRECTIONS FOR USING
For THINKING: --Wind the
Clock-work Man under his left arm, (marked No. 1)
For SPEAKING: --Wind the
Clock-work Man under his right arm, (marked No. 2)
For WALKING: --Wind
Clock-work in the -middle of his back, (marked No. 3)
N.B.--This Mechanism is
guaranteed to work perfectly for a thousand years. These instructions
were used to build Dr. Greens (Mengeles) boxes and the robots.
pg. 58 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
The words sounded a little hoarse and creakey, and they were uttered
all in the same tone, without any change of expression whatever; but
both Dorothy and Billina understood them perfectly. This was used to
program the internal robots to speak in unison and to repeat themselves.
pg. 60 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
Af-ter that I re-mem-ber noth-ing until you wound me up a-gain. The
internal robots forget and then are prepared again for war.
pg. 62 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
From this time forth I am your o-be-di-ent servant. What-ev-er you
com-mand, that I will do will-ing-ly--if you keep me wound up. This is
used to teach the internal robots obedience to their programming.
pg. 67 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
Within the pail were three slice of turkey, two slices of cold tongue,
some lobster salad, four slices of bread and butter, a small custard
pie, an orange and nine large strawberries and some nuts and raisins.
Singularly enough, the nuts in this
dinner-pail grew already
cracked, so that Dorothy had no trouble in picking out their meats to
eat. This is given to front alters as the front programming so that
they see the programs as only fruit.
pg. 68 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
Do the lunch-box trees and the dinner-pail trees belong to the
Wheelers? the child asked Tiktok, while engaged in eating her meal.
Of course not, he
answered. They belong to the roy-al fam-il-y of Ev, on-ly of course
there is no roy-al fam-il-y just now be-cause King Ev-ol-do jumped in-to
the sea and his wife and ten children have been trans-formed by the Nome
King...you will find the roy-al E stamped up-on the bottom of ev-er-y
din-ner pail. The Nome
King in the programming became the ruler of the demons/system within the
Monarch system. Several story lines from a number of sources are
overlapped to reinforce the programming scripts. The programmers will
use other stories to introduce themselves into the system too. In case
readers dont know, a Monarch system will have hidden powerful alters
that are made in the image of their programmers, that serve as personal
representatives of the programmers.
pg. 79 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
I am only a ma-chine, and can-not feel sor-row or joy, no mat-ter
what hap-pens. This is teaching mechanical dissociation, and coincides
with Tin Man programming.
pg. 83 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
For the Princess Langwidere is a different person every time I see
her, and the only way her subjects can recognize her at all is by means
of a beautiful ruby key which she always wears on a chain attached to
her left wrist. When we see the key we know we are beholding the
Princess. That is strange, said Dorothy, in astonishment. Do you
mean to say that so many different princesses are one and the same
person? Not exactly, answered the Wheeler. There is, of course, but
one princess; but she appears to us in many forms, which are all more or
less beautiful. Doesnt this sound like MPD! Did Frank Baum know about
MPD?
pg. 90 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, Princess Langwideres sitting-room was panelled with great
mirrors, which reached from the ceiling to the floor; also the ceiling
was composed of mirrors, and the floor was of polished silver that
reflected every object upon it.
So when Langwidere sat in her easy chair
and played soft melodies upon her mandolin, her form was mirrored
hundreds of times, in walls, and ceilings and floor, and whichever
way... This is the mirror programming that has been done to so many
victims!
pg. 91 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
Now I must explain to you that the Princess Langwidere had thirty
heads. Isnt this story line convenient for programming?
pg. 94 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
...Langwidere to a position in front of cupboard No. 17, the
Princess unlocked the door with her ruby key and after handing head
No.9, which she had been wearing, to the maid, she took No. 17 from its
shelf and fitted it to her neck....There was one trouble with No. 17;
the temper that went with it (and which was hidden...)was fiery, harsh
and haughty in the extreme, and it often led the Princess to do
unpleasant things which she regretted when she came to wear her other
heads. Does the reader see how this is programming to switch
personalities. And personality No. 17 is locked up--which is a common
programming methodology. The fiery, harsh anger--those are the demonic
imps that the victim is coached to accept as normal which are layered
in. (See chapter 10).
pg. 98 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
To hear is to obey, answered the big red colonel, and caught the
child by the arm.
pg. 99 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
...the colonel had by this time managed to get upon his feet again,
so he grabbed fast hold of the girl and she was helpless to escape.
pg. 102 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, Once a cyclone had carried her across it, and a magical pair of
silver shoes had carried her back again.
pg. 103 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, Fist came a magnificent golden chariot, drawn by a great
Lion and an immense Tiger, who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted
along as gracefully as a well-matched team of thoroughbred horses. And
standing upright within the chariot was a beautiful girl clothed in
flowing robes of silver gauze and wearing a jeweled diadem upon her
dainty head. She held in
one hand the satin ribbons that guided her astonishing team, and in the
other an ivory wand that separated at the top into two prongs, the
prongs being tipped by the letters 0 and Z, made of glistening
diamonds set closely together. The way this was used for programming is
that guard alters are made out of kittens, who believe they are fierce
tigers and lions and other wild cats. Ozma, represents the Illuminati
Queen Mother with her crown and scepter.
pg. 104 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, On this page we see Ozma of Oz, the Scarecrow, the Saw-Horse,
the Tin Woodman, and soldiers. These characters were used in the
programming. Toward the bottom of the page is something that was built
into the Systems so that alters would stay in place in their internal
world, ...the green carpet rolled itself up again...In order that their
feet might not come in contact with the deadly, life-destroying sands of
the desert.
pg. 117 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, Dorothy took the key to Tiktok from her pocket and wound up the
machine mans action, so that he could bow properly when introduced to
the rest of the company.
pg. 119-120 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, Let me introduce to you a new friend of mine, the Hungry
Tiger....he displayed two rows of terrible teeth and a mouth big enough
to startle anyone.
Dreadfully hungry,
answered the Tiger, snapping his jaws together with a fierce click.
This is programming for deeper cats in an alter system. The next page
tells how this is used to teach the child alter cannibalism. ...the
tiger. For my part, Im a savage beast, and have an
appetite for all sorts of poor living creatures, from a chipmonk to fat
babies. How dreadful! said Dorothy. Isnt it, though? returned the
Hungry Tiger licking his lips with his long red tongue. Fat
babies! Dont they sound delicious? ...If I had no conscience I would
probably eat the babies and then get hungry again, which would mean that
I had sacrificed the poor babies for nothing....For it is the nature of
tigers to be cruel and ferocious, and in refusing to eat harmless living
creatures I am acting as no good tiger has ever before acted. This part
of the book is used to help teach the child alters which think they are
tigers to be cannibalistic and actually participate in eating babies.
This is all filmed to be used against the mind-controlled slave.
pg. 130-3 1 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, No one knows, exactly, replied the Princess. For the
King, whose name is Roquat of the Rocks, owns a splendid palace
underneath the great mountain which is at the north end of this kingdom,
and he has transformed the queen and her children into ornaments and
bric-a-brac with which to decorate his rooms. Id like to know, said
Dorothy, Who this Nome King is?
I will tell you, replied
Ozma. He is said to be the Ruler of the Underground World, and commands
the rocks and all that the rocks contain. Under his rule are many
thousands of the Nomes, who are queerly shaped but powerful sprites that
labor at the furnaces and forges of their king, making gold and silver
and other metals which they conceal in the crevices of the rocks, so
that those living upon the earths surface can only find them with great
difficulty. Also they make diamonds and rubies and emeralds, which they
hide in the ground; so that the kingdom of Nomes is wonderfully rich,
and all we have of precious stones and silver and gold is what we take
from the earth and rocks where the Nome King has hidden them....the
Ruler of the Underground World is not fond of those who live upon the
earths surface, and never appears among us. If we wish to see King
Roquat of the Rocks, we must visit his won country, where he is all
powerful, and therefore it will be a dangerous undertaking....the
furnaces of the Nome King....a single spark of fire might destroy me
entirely. The furnaces may also melt my tin, said the Tin Woodman;
but I am going. I cant bear heat, remarked the Princess... This is
used to program in the dwarfs who mine the jewels (programs). The dwarfs
are often demonic imps or gnomes, rather than being real alters. Notice
that the story line fits in beautifully with the Hell Pit that the
- Programmers so often put
at the basement of peoples minds. The Hell Pit would have programming
to make someone burn. If someone approaches where the Dwarfs live (which
is deep underground--deep in the mind) they will burn. Notice again the
words diamonds, rubies, emeralds, silver and gold which are all parts of
programming codes.
pg. 139 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, But I know enough to obey my masters, and to gid-dup, or
whoa, when Im told to. This is teaching obedience. Lower down the
table were the twenty-seven warriors of Oz.
This was used to create alters within the
internal world.
pg. 147-148 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, The form was that of a gigantic man built out of plates of
cast iron, and it stood with one foot on either side of the narror road
and swung over its right shoulder an immense iron mallet, with which it
constantly pounded the earth. These resounding blows explained the
thumping sounds they had heard, for the mallet was much bigger than a
barrel, and where it struck the path between the rocky sides of the
mountain it filled all the space through which our travelers would be
obliged to pass.
Of course they at once
halted, a safe distance away from the terrible iron mallet. The magic
carpet would do them no good in this case, for it was only meant to
protect them from any dangers upon the ground beneath their feet, and
not from dangers that appeared in the air above them. Wow! said the
Cowardly Lion, with a shudder. It makes me dreadfully nervous to see
that big hammer pounding so near my head. One blow would crush me into a
door-mat.
The ir-on gi-ant is a
fine fellow, said Tiktok, and works as stead-i-ly as a clock. He was
made for the Nome King by Smith & Tin-ker, who made me, and his du-ty is
to keep folks from find-ing the un-der-ground pal-ace.
Is he not a great work of art?... No,
replied the machine; he is only made to pound the road, and has no
think-ing or speak-ing at-tach-ment. But he pounds ve-ry well, I
think....
Is there no way to stop his
machinery? On-ly the Nome King, who has the key, can do that,
answered Tiktok....Meanwhile the giant continued to raise his iron
mallet high in the air and to strike the path terrific blows that echoed
through the mountains like the roar of cannon. This was used as the
script to place in Thor, a giant who protects the programming. Very
severe split brain headaches are programmed to occur to the victim,
whenever the internal Thor pounds his hammer. If the programming is
threatened, Thor and the imps (demons) appear, to protect it. There are
an entire series of events using programming and obedient alters that
takes place to protect the programming, if it is ever threatened.
pg. 159 Book 3
Ozma of Oz, There was no reply, except that the shifting Nomes upon
the mountain laughed in derision. You must not command the Nome King.
said Tiktok, for you do not rule him, as you do your own people. The
purpose of this part is to prepare the childs alters to accept that
internal Queens and other leading alters do not rule the demons that are
placed into their system, and are not to order them around.
pg. 163 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, In the center of this room was a throne carved out of a solid
boulder of rock, rude and rugged in shape but glittering with great
rubies and diamonds and emeralds on every part of its surface. And upon
the throne sat the Nome King.
pg. 167 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, on this page is a picture of the Nome King telling Dorothy and
Ozma that, They belong to me and I shall keep them. In other words,
the imps and their jewells belong to the king of the demons. Around his
throne are steps with gems, and this imagery was used to build the
internal gems in a system, with Satan/the AntiChrists throne at the top
of the stairs.
pg. 170 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, Although this army consisted of rock-colored Nomes, all squat
and fat, they were clothed in glittering armor of polished steel, inlaid
with beautiful gems. Upon his brow each wore a brilliant electric light,
and they bore sharp spears and swords and battle-axes if solid bronze.
It was evident they were perfectly trained, for they stood in straight
rows, rank after rank, with their weapons held erect and true, as if
awaiting but the word of command to level them upon their foes. This,
siad the Nome King, is but a small part of my army. No ruler upon Earth
has ever dared to fight me, and no ruler ever will, for I am too
powerful to oppose. This was to help build acceptance within the child
of the layering of armies of demons.
pg. 180, Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, For upon the edge of the table rested a pretty grasshopper,
that seemed to have been formed from a single emerald. The next page
has a picture of a grasshopper wearing a hat and many shoes. This was
used to help the victim take the hypnotic suggestion that their
programmer was a grasshopper, a cricket. Mengele used a clicker which
helped with this hypnotic suggestion too.
pg. 182-183 Book 3 Ozma
of Oz, ...the King returned to his throne.... they were greatly
disheartened by...the knowledge that she was now an ornament in the Nome
Kings palace -- a dreadful, creepy place in spite of all its
magnificence. Without their little leader they did not know what to do
next, and each one, down to the trembling private of the army, began to
fear he would soon be more ornamental than useful....Never mind, said
the jolly monarch. If he doesnt care to enter the palace...Ill throw
him into one of my fiery furnaces.
pg. 184 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
...twenty-six officers filed into the palace and made their
guesses---and became ornaments. Story line used to program parts to
become useful ornaments. ...he wore a heavy gold chain around his neck
to show that he was the Chief Steward of the Nome King... Many of the
abusers signify their power to the slaves, by wearing a gold chain
around their neck.
pg. 186 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
on this page it states that some magical power gave the King the ability
to know all that took place in his palace. By crediting their abilities
to an occult magical dimension, the programmers enhanced their
appearance of power to the child victim. pg. 192 Book 3 Ozma of Oz, on
this page and the surrounding pages, the people who have become
ornaments are also assigned colors. The Queen of Ev are all ornaments
of a royal purple color. and all those people from Oz into green
ornaments.
pg. 194 Book 3 Ozma of Oz,
If I wore the magic belt which enables you to work all your
transformations, and gives you so much other power....What color will
you make the Kansas girl? asked the Steward. Gray, I think, said his
Majesty. And the Scarecrow and the machine man? Oh, they shall be of
solid gold, because they are so ugly in real life. This was the script
to bring in the color programming. Color programming is discussed in the
Structuring chapter (7) and the Internal Controls chapter (11) dealing
with the internal computers, and in chapter 4 where the codes are given.
pg. 192 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, What more do you want? demanded the King. A fat baby. I want
a fat baby, said the Hungry Tiger. A nice, plump, juicy, tender, fat
baby. When the alters are forced to accept that they are tigers and
other cats, then they are encouraged (forced) into cannibalism.
pg. 200 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, So Tiktok touched a yellow glass vase that had daisies painted
on one side, and he spoke at the same time the word Ev. .... In a
flash the machine man had disappeared,... This was part of the
programming to introduce daisies and switching.
pg. 201 Book 3 Ozma of
Oz, Next she touched the image of a purple kitten that stood on the
corner of a mantel, and as she pronounced the word Ev the kitten
disappeared, and a pretty, fair-haired boy stood beside her. This is
teaching the switching of alters and their color programming.
**We will stop our
coverage of the Ozma of Oz book here. We have only partially covered
only two of the 14 Oz books, all of which were used as programming
scripts. There are many more sections in this series of 14 books that
served as programming scripts, but the reader has got the basic idea.
It is still important to go
over how some of the other books were used in programming, so that the
reader begins to see how the story lines assist in programming, and how
the story lines are so frequently tied together from perhaps 12
different stories to reinforce one alters programming.
ALICE IN WONDERLAND
Alice Through the Looking
Glass
I cant believe that! said
Alice. Cant you? the Queen said in a pitying tone. Try again: draw a
long breath, and shut your eyes. Alice laughed. Theres no use
trying, she said. One cant believe impossible things. I dare say
you havent had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I
always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes
Ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. The
chapter Which Dreamed It in Alice Through the Looking Glass has
sexual programming, the Red Queen is purring. The story where Walruses
make believe it is oysters is used for programming. Other sexual
programming occurs in the chapter Its my own invention where the
Knight In Crimson (& White) Armor are prisoners which dual for her.
Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum is used for S&M programming, which has a hand
signal involving rotating the thumbs of a clasp hand. Alters go through
the looking glass, and fall down an oak tree by falling into a deeper
and deeper trance. Monarch programming is a reflection of how
Satans mind works. Lewis Carrolls book with its inversion themes fits
in with this type of thinking. Lewis Carroll loved the humor of logical
contradictions. In the book, Alice wonders if cats eat bats or bats eat
cats, and she is told that to say what she means is not the same as
meaning what she says. When she eats the left side of the mushroom, she
grows large; the right side has the reverse effect. These changes in
size are in themselves reversals.
A large girl and small puppy end up to
be a large puppy and a small girl. In Sylvia and Bruno, we are presented
with an antigravity wool that can be placed into a parcel to make it
weigh less than nothing, a watch that reverses time, a black light, and
a projective plane with outside inside and inside outside. The slave
learns that E-V-I-L is simply L-I-V-E backwards. In the looking glass
world, the Red Queen knows of a hill so large that compared to it the
hill in question is a valley. Also she knows of dry biscuits which
quench thirst, a messenger who whispers by shouting, and Alice who runs
as fast as she can to stay in one place. (Sometimes it seems we really
do have to run fast to stay in place.) The King of Hearts thinks its not
unusual to write letters to nobody, and the White King compliments Alice
on having keen enough eyesight to see nobody at a great distance down
the road. Can you see why this book was so good to program us?
In the
book Through the Looking Glass all asymmetrical objects (that
means all objects which cant be superimposed on their mirrored image)
go the other way. There are left-right reversals. Tweedledee and
Tweedledum are mirror image twins. The White Knight sings about
squeezing his right foot into a left shoe, and there are several
mentions of corkscrews. A Helix (a corkscrew) is an asymmetric structure
with distinct left and right forms. The books type of thinking was
extended beyond asymmetrical objects to asymmetrical relations of all
types. For example, Alice walks backward, in the railway carriage the
guard tells her she is traveling the wrong way. The king has two
messengers, one to come and one to go. The White Queen explains the
advantages of living backward in time, the looking glass cake is handed
around first, then sliced. Odd and even numbers, which are equivalent to
left and right or on and off are worked into the story at several
points.
For instance, the White Queen requests jam every other day.
Going through the looking glass takes us to a world where the ordinary
world is turned upside down and backward. Things go every which way
except the way they are supposed to go. Anti-matter is a mirror image.
Anti-matter milk will explode Alice, but an Anti-matter Alice on the
other side of the looking glass can drink the anti-matter milk. In
Chapter 11 Alice captures the Red Queen. It results in a legitimate
checkmate of the Red King, who has slept through the entire live size
chess game without moving. The checkmate ends the dream, but leaves open
in the story the question of whether the dream was Alices or the Red
Kings. The programming has so often been only a dream to us.
The
outside world was so often just an unreal dream to us. What was real and
what was not real? The real world (for other people)
was full of contradictions, and the unreal world (our internal world)
was consistent. Everything was upside down, forwards and backwards. In
the Looking Glass book, one shuttles back and forth mysteriously between
real and dream worlds. So, either Ive been dreaming about life
or I only dream that life is but a dream. As a slave breaks away from
the programming, life becomes a bewildering confusion as the slave is
pulled between two worlds. The internal world has everything the alter
needs, the external world is a harsh cold reality that doesnt have much
to offer. People in the external world can help make it real for a
slave. The handlers will never do this.
Alters will need a reason to
want to come out of the internal reality which they are programmed to.
believe in. For so long much of life was seen as a dream. It will be
hard to get a grasp on what was real and what was the lie. Many of the
lies are more real than the truth. Life was sometimes like the parallel
dreams of the Red King and Alice, like two mirrors facing each other.
The TALL Book of MAKE
BELIEVE
This book was published by
Harper & Row in 1950 and was indeed tall, the pages being 4 x 9 1/2.
On page 14, the programmer would read the first paragraph of the poem
and then say sleep, sleep, sleep. Have you ever heard of the
Sugar-Plum Tree? Tis a marvel of great renown! It blooms on the shore
of the Lollypop Sea in the garden of Shut-Eye Town; The fruit that it
bears is so wondrously sweet (As those who have tasted it say) That good
little children have only to eat of that fruit to be happy next day.
Sleep, Sleep, Sleep.
On page 16-17, there
is a story about how a child is dragged under the kitchen door and
becomes flat. There is a picture of a child being pulled under a door
and coming out flat on page 17. This was used as part of the script to
make the ribbons for the slaves.
The ribbons in a system can go under
doors and through the entire system.
On page 23, Rosa the flat person
(pancake person) is shown again. This is ribbon. The top of the page has
a large cricket like creature that was said to the child to be the
programmer (Dr. Mengele). All of the stories in The Tall Book of Make
Believe were used one way or the other in programming. We will just
touch on some notable points.
On page 38 is a poem about a Mr. Nobody.
The programmers like to have alters identify themselves as nobody.
On
page 39 is a poem/story about someone who comes tapping...but it is
only the cricket whistling. This was used to help program in that the
3 taps were the cricket (the cover image for the programmer.)
On page
50, is the story of a girl who when she lays down becomes a different
person Mrs. Brown.
On page 67 is a poem Foreign Lands, where the child
sees the skys blue looking glass and then ends up to where the roads
on either hand lead onward into fairyland.. .and all the playthings come
alive. In other words, what is in effect being communicated is: take
the hypnotic image of flying into the sky in Papas silver plane (as the
plane goes up the trance goes higher -deeper) and then
go into a fantasy land where all your
wishes can come true--so that you can escape the hell us
programmers are giving you.
On page 79 is the story of a ghost
named Georgie who would run home and warn people at home when things
were broken. This was part of the fix me programming--so that
ghost-like alters, known as reporting alters, call HOME to PAPA if
the programming is touched.
On page 84 is the story How they bring back
The Village of Cream Puffs When the Wind Blows it away. This story has
several programming words in it, these words and their meanings are as
follows: In programming the Village of Liver-and-Onions is a code word
for the coven. Prairie means ceremony site, and in another story
picnic means ritual. Its doubtful that most alters would remember
these meanings, but they helped the abusers confuse the child. Imagine
the victim trying to describe a ritual and telling someone that a
village of liver & onions had a picnic.
ALIEN PROGRAMMING SCRIPTS
There are numerous scripts
for the Alien programming. Recent novels and Hollywood movies provide a
non-ending pool of programming resources for the Programmers. Visual
reality headgear and other high-tech methods can easily be incorporated
into an alien abduction theme. The following are samples of some of
the people who the author Fritz has spent time with, who on one level
knew they needed help, but didn'tt know just what they felt uneasy about.
PERSON 1. Had been
abducted by aliens since she was a small child. Different types of
aliens took her. Her
mother worked for the CIA at
Area 51. Her mother was abusive to her. One
of her best friends is a Monarch slave. When the aliens come a bright
light appears and then they abduct her. The aliens she works with the
most look exactly like people, and in their handwriting show severe
abuse. These benevolent aliens have taken her fetusus several times. She
has time-travelled to their planet. She is dissociative. The
government authorities are constantly monitoring and tracking her, and
have made an effort to besmudge her record, so that it appears like she
is looney tunes. This is the type of cases that this book's co-author
has spent time working with. Doesn't this sound more like human
mind-control than real aliens?
PERSON 2. This person hears
aliens within his head (which when described sounds like a case of MPD
(DID)). The aliens would take him and force him to have homosexual
activities even though he didn't want to participate. But that was O.K.
to him, because they were a superior race and if these benevolent
aliens which are so far advanced beyond us, want to have sex with him,
that is their prerogative. This person has a lot of depression. This
person wonders why the authorities seem to keep track of him.
PERSON 3. This person worked
at Area 51. Has a photographic memory throughout his entire MPD system.
He realizes that he is MPD. His best friend claims to be an alien, a god
of sorts, and is known by both this person & Fritz to be part of Naval
Intelligence. This best friend acts more like a handler than an alien,
and this Area 51 worker gives his best friend total allegiance. This man
has all kinds of alien type stories, which sound in many cases like
programming. This person admits that his family is Illuminati, and the
front alters say he has watched Illuminati rituals as an adult, but
hasn't participated.
He shows signs of severe abuse. He is afraid to
talk about trauma-based mind-control, but loves to talk about aliens. In
fact, all three of the persons discussed on this page shied away from
talking about Monarch mind-control, as if it were something not
important, but they all love to talk about aliens.
And the list of interesting
people like this could go on. When Mind-controlled slaves who have alien
programming are being abducted by the intelligence agencies for their
use and for programming here are some of the details of how and what
occurs: A bright light is shined into their house. They have been
hypnotically conditioned to view this light as a Flying Saucer, whether
it is a helicopter or something else. As the NWO does have Flying
Saucers, sometimes the real thing is used. Men in Black (just like in
SRA cases) are often associated with the abductions. And the slaves
frequently speak about "shadows in the mind." The slaves are taken to
rooms where examining tables with white sheets and
X-ray machines, Headgear and medical equipment is in place.
The alien
equipment has gotten more high-tech over the last 40 years. The
aliens wear suits that are full of occult symbology. The people are
restrained with clamps and electrical shock and energy is used on them.
They are told that they are receiving information. They are given
tracking implants and other implants. All of the 3 above persons,
receive information from the aliens regularly. Almost all of the
elements of Monarch trauma-based mind-control appear in these abduction
accounts, especially in the psychological features of the victim. The
victims of alien abduction programming feel suicidal after they talk
too much. They have headaches, sleep difficulties, nightmares, obsessive
thoughts, a fear of hypnosis, trapped feelings, and paranoia. During
their abductions the aliens use drugs, thought transfers, and painful
medical procedures.
The aliens use language that parallels the
messages given to SRA victims, just change the language from Satan is
in charge to the Aliens are in charge . Cattle mutilations where the
blood has been drained are associated with abductions. There are documented
accounts where cattle mutilations have been connected to Satanic cults
using helicopters. The victims of aliens are forced to be impregnated
and then the fetus is repeatedly taken. The aliens are repeatedly
telling these victims that a holocaust is soon to come. Another strange
phenomena, that others and this author have noticed is that these
victims of alien abduction seen to know each other, much in the same
way that victims of Illuminati mind-control seem to know each other. And
the aliens seem to know everything about the victims. The victims have
amnesia of their abductions.
The memories of their abductions are hidden
in altered states of consciousness, that hypnosis sometimes can pull up.
Most victims are afraid of hypnosis or can't be hypnotized (they have
been hypnotized not to allow anyone else to hypnotize them.)
To give credit where
due, Bowart's Operation Mind Control Researcher's edition, (1994) has an
excellent appendix with charts which compare SRA mind-control victims
and alien abduction victims. The charts reveal how similar the two
groups are. In preparing these paragraphs, we have used his charts as as
a basis for how we wrote these last two paragraphs up.
However, the
co-authors` experiences in working with abduction victims match the
findings of Bowart. Do aliens from another planet exist? They may or may
not. It is not a real issue, we have to face what is already on this
planet. Fritz has several tapes of aliens of different types talking
(which were obtained from abduction survivors) and their voices sound
demonic and they are saying that they have been alive on this planet for
many years.
One said something like
he's been here on earth 500,000
years. If an alien has lived on this planet for 1/2 million years, when
does he get residence status. My! If that is true, he is no alien--we
are! But one thing is certain, this planet contains some very slimy evil
creatures who are either real non-humans or very deceptive dark humans.
The Bible calls them demons and reprobate men. The four most popular
origins of supposed aliens on earth are all star groups relatively close
to our solar system.
They are: the
Pleiades, known as the 7 or 9
sisters, because there are 9 stars of which 7 are visible; Sirius, the
dog constellation; the Orion constellation; and the twin stars of
Zeta Reticulli, which twin stars were amazingly charted by Chinese
astrologers in 3,000 B.C.! Fritz, the co-author of this book kept an
open mind on the issue, could there be any benevolent aliens? Some
abductees believed that their aliens were benevolent, but when they are
debriefed they admit that mind-control and sexual molestation is carried
out by the aliens. Fritz, has concluded with other investigators on this
question, there are no benevolent aliens, in fact the only aliens that
may be around are what have been known as demons.
People who have
participated in high level Illuminati ceremonies report the presence of
creatures that look like the various aliens. (This whole subject is
dealt with in another book by Fritz Springmeier.) Some points might be
briefly brought out. Fritz has amassed a great deal of evidence that the
elite have human-built Flying Saucers.
Notice how the
controlled media always link aliens with Flying Saucers and
UFOs? This
is an entire book in itself, however, the bottom line is that at least
most (if not all) of the alien abductions are simply part of the NWO's
mind-control. It is obvious
that for various reasons (including the goals set down in the secret
Iron Mountain government report), the government (including cooperating
agencies like NASA) decided to use an alien abduction theme rather than
a Satanic Ritual Abuse theme to their mind-control programming. The
major differences in the programming methodology is that the blood
rituals of the SRA are no longer used.
The reason why blood rituals are
no longer needed is that the high-tech harmonic machines (which implant
thoughts-see chap. 6) and other high-tech methods eliminate the need for
the blood traumas. The victims of alien abductions are taken at random,
where the Illuminati victims are abducted more frequently around ritual
dates. The person who believes in UFOs and aliens is going to receive
the same type of treatment as those who believe in Satanic Ritual Abuse.
The legal system and society at large are conditioned to treat them as
nuts. This protects their abusers. An Illuminati hierarchy member
described their magic goal of pursuing a spiritual path through the
finer frequencies of outer time. The alien programming is one way to
experience this.
ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS
This is a child's book by
Scott O'Dell. The people of an island have both an everyday name and a
magical name. When the chief gives his magical name to a Russian captain
named Orlov, he and his warriors end up being killed in battle. The
alters of Monarch slaves have names they can give outsiders and then
their access code names which must be kept secret. Part of the story is
to stay in line with what one's ancestors have done. Other items in the
book, such as the four winds from the four directions fit in with
programming too. The book is just one of many that the programmers want
the children to hear so that they naturally adopt the correct
programming scripts.
THE LORD OF THE RINGS
Some Illuminati survivors
are always looking for a ring. Rings play a significant part in the
lives and programming of slaves. One section that is coding/programming
found in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is One Ring to rule them
all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the
darkness bind them.
THE MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAMMING SCRIPT --
THE LESSER KEY
One of the most important
scripts for the Illuminati Mind-control Programmers is the Lesser Key of Solomon Goetia, The Book of Evil Spirits. The Illuminati Doctors Green,
Black, White and Blue (that is Mengele, Wheeler, Cameron, and
Mueller)
were fully knowledgeable about The Lesser Key of Solomon Goetia. In
fact, all those who go beyond the initial levels in the Illuminati are
required to study the entire book. It's an important ritual book.
It is very out of fashion to
believe in demons. It is in fashion to believe in aliens, in ghosts, in
the internal psychological wizard that guides you , and other things
which to those high in demonology secretly know are simply covers for
what used to be called demons. Both the high level
Illuminati and the alert Christians are saying many of the same things
concerning demons. Is magical phenomena real? Do the programmers
really believe in it? In the
Lesser Key of Solomon Goetia it
answers,
I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all
magical phenomena; if they are illusions, they are at least as real
as many unquestioned facts of daily life; and... they are at least
evidence of some cause. (p.10)
The author of the Lesser Key of
Solomon Goetia (L.W. De Laurence) then points out that all our sense impressions of the
universe are dependent upon changes in the brain. Reality is a
perception of the mind. So the author states,
...we must include
illusions, which are after all sense impressions as much as realities
are, in the class of phenomena dependent on brain changes. Magical
phenomena, however, come under a special subclass, since they are
willed, and their cause is the series of real phenomena called the
operations of ceremonial magic.
In other words, when the Illuminati
practice ceremonial magic, their magic to them is as real as life, but
they do not feel a need to defend its reality. People in the occult
encourage children to fantasize. Fantasy is looked at with favor.
Whether the power and healing and mind-control of demonology stems from
illusion or Jungs autonomous power of the human psyche to attract &
manifest archetypes through the human soul or some other source is not
an issue for Satanists.
They are seeing results, power, healings and the
destruction of their enemies by demonology. Within the Illuminati
illusion, myth, and perception are all esteemed. Are they alone? Are
they alone? No, they are not alone. The myth that the United States is a
democracy is probably a far stronger reality in the minds of Americans
than the actual reality that it is a tightly controlled secret oligarchy
with a republican front. But in this case, which is the greater real
reality? The American believes his myth enough that he dies for it. He
fights the war to end all wars and then the war to save the world FOR
DEMOCRACY (to quote some popular world war slogans). In the American
mind, he achieves victory even though he has fought and died for a myth.
And even when the mythical goals he fought for arent even achieved, he
believes he has achieved a victory. The first world war never brought
everlasting peace and the war to save the world for democracy ended
after victory with more of the world under stronger totalitarian rule
than before the war began.
The bottom line is that myths and illusions
make up a large part of the reality of most peoples lives.
Movie actors
have repeatedly found out that they incur their fans wrath if they try
to reveal their real selves to the public.
The point also is that the
person practicing ceremonial magic will not be impressed by the average
person, even if he be a minister,
who has structured his life on myths
and illusions, who will tell him that his ceremonial magic is not real.
The magician will naturally ask, Who IS living in a world of reality?
Ceremonial magic is a very strong reality to the Illuminatis
mind-controlled slaves, because the programmers make great efforts to
develop the five impressions listed on page 11 of The Lesser Key,
which are:
(1) Sight. The circle,
square, triangle, vessels, lamps, robes, implements, etc.
(2) Sound. The invocations.
(3) Smell. The perfumes.
(4) Taste. The Sacrements.
(5)
Touch. As under (1).
These are reflected upon by
the person, and these 5 produce unusual brain-changes. Later two more
senses are also highly developed. Programmed multiple-slaves have visual
and auditory accuity far beyond the normal person. The Lesser Keys of
Solomon Goetia goes on to say, The Spirits of the Goetia are
portions of the human brain. Their seals therefore represent methods of
stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye).
The names of God are
vibrations calculated to establish:
(a) General control of the
brain....
(b) Control over the brain
in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit)
(c) Control of one special
portion. (Name of Spirit.)
The perfumes aid this
through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend to control a large
area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabet
enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirits name.
(p. 12)
Did the reader grasp that?
The most important script for the programmers is to use ceremonial magic
which uses the names of God to establish GENERAL, & SPECIFIC CONTROL
(via a hierarchical arrangement of demons) over a persons mind. More
will be covered about this in Chapter 10. But while we are on the
subject lets go just a little bit farther. If, then, I say, with
Solomon: The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic, what I mean is: Those
portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may be
stimulated and developed by following out the processes called The
Invocation of Cimieries.
And this is exactly
what the programmers do.
They invoke via many rituals all types of specific demons (or demonic
energy) to enhance the particular mental functions they want. For
instance, Typhon and Choronzon (also Horonzon) are demons who are
essential in building the structure of a programmed multiple. They must
be invoked before the early start of dividing the mind. Michael Bertieaux heads up the
Horonzon Club, an unofficial part of Kenneth
Grants OTO.
The demon Horonzon (or Choronzon) looks like a grey alien,
and was conjured up by Sir John Dee, who was Queen Elizabeth Is genius
advisor and court sorcerer. Transyuggothian magic is carried out in
order to reach Transyuggothian Space (also known as Trans-Plutonian
Space and Universe B). The existence of these dimensions is kept very
secret. The ancient cult of the Star Sirius, from which supposedly we
are now getting aliens, had rituals to get one into the celebrated
Universe B. Sirius B (the binary twin star that exists with the actual
Sirius A star) represented the god Ra Hoor Khuit. Sirius A represented
the Egyptian devil. Lets reflect on all this demonic illusion. As
stated, an American will die for the myth that America is saving the
world for democracy.
This made sense to psychologists at the time.
However, if a slave dies for what he sees as the reality of voodoo
magic, the psychologist dismisses it as unimportant--a mere coincidence.
Since voodoo magic doesnt exist in the psychologists mind, the
psychologist believes that magic carries no threat to its intended
victim. Likewise, because the psychologist doesnt believe in demons,
demons supposedly pose no threat to the mind-controlled slave.
The
psychologist is really projecting his perception of reality upon someone
else, and it doesnt work. The Illuminati programmers are counting on
the therapists ignoring demonology. In Bowarts in-most-respects
excellent book
Operation Mind Control, (Researcher Edition, Ft.
Bragg, CA: Flatland, 1994, p. 249.) asks the reader to self-hypnotize
himself by several times looking into your minds eye. To Bowart, he
sees the trance state as merely looking into your minds eye. He does
not attribute any demonic activity to be involved with such things.
No
wonder, Bowart writes very disparagingly and critically about Christians
who are trying to do demonic deliverances to slaves. But then as far as
I know Bowart hasnt freed anyone of their mind-control either, he is
just a reporter. Both ministers and psychologists have contempt for each
others excesses. We must bear in mind that the victims of this total
mind-control have their bodies, minds, and spirits enslaved. The body,
mind and spirit need to be simultaneously liberated. A great deal of the
success of the Programmers is that ministers have
rejected the study of the mind (psychology) and therapists have rejected
spiritual things.
The victim is left without a way to heal both spirit
and mind. Partial freedom is still slavery. And not only that but
both therapists and ministers seem to feel the actual physical threats
to the slaves body to be outside of their jurisdiction, and by default
it is left up to the victim to provide. Which again without the body
safe and healed, the mind and spirit are not fully free. There are
therapists and others who pontificate about how evil Christian ministers
are for trying to deliver mind-controlled slaves from their demonic
possession. This is not the problem.
The problem is that the Illuminati
have skillfully separated the various therapeutic elements both
functionally and legally. The answer to the enslavement of body, soul,
mind and spirit is a team of people who will address all the issues
together. Both the psychologists and ministers see the excesses of each
other, but a little humility would go a long way, for both sides to
recognize each others value. God works through all people, even those
who resist Him. That is why he can rightly be called Almighty God.
THE USE OF LIES EXTERNALLY &
INTERNALLY, THE USE OF COVERS AND FRONTS, & THE ART OF HIDING THINGS IN
A SYSTEM
EXTERNAL DECEPTIONS
There seems to be no
end to the lies that are involved with the Monarch programming. The old
adage that nothing is as it appears, is generally the rule. However,
once one catches on to the common tactics of deceptions, the tactics
themselves become red flags which can alert a thinking person to what is
hidden. This is similar to
those Russians who could read between the lines when reading communist
propaganda and figure Out the truth. The deception begins with covering
up the identity of the slave. Within the Illuminati, the art of hiding
genealogies is a fine art. Children are swapped and placed with foster
parents. Mothers all of a sudden have babies, when no one has noticed
them being pregnant. Investigators like Fritz Springmeier, who have been
investigating court house records and other primary documents have seen
court house records altered overnight, to cover up genealogical and
financial information.
COVERS FOR INDIVIDUAL SLAVES
The individual slave is
usually given a good cover. A good cover will be one that cannot be seen
through, and still allows the person the freedom to get their job done.
When building a cover, the following questions will be asked: how much
will this cover allow this person to spend? what kind of people can this
person associate with? where can this person go? and what kind of hobby
can he or she have? By now, the Illuminati have their secret slaves in
so many places that they have their bases covered in all fields. True
life examples include: a Monarch programmer who appears to be simply a
middle class housewife.
A Monarch computer programmer who appears to be
a deaf and dumb mute when in the presence of the public, but the deeper
brilliant alters work secretly at programming computers during the day.
An international spy, who is a programmed multiple, who has a totally
different set of I.D. and wigs, so that when they switch to certain
alters used for the intelligence agencies--they not only act different,
they look different, and have different valid I.D. An apparently dumb
blond may be a very intelligent highly trained Monarch slave. Within the
intelligence world Monarch slaves will function as Agent Provocateurs,
which are people who join groups with the purpose of leading the group
to do things that will cause it harm. The neo-Nazis are full of
Agent Provocateurs as are some of the Patriot groups.
Some Monarch slaves are what is called clean agents -- that is they
have never been used in intelligence work, so they have no record of
use.
Monarchs are great for being used by this or that group on a
limited basis without anyone suspecting any connection. The Intelligence
term for the elaborate cover histories they give one of their Monarch
slaves to operate as an agent is called a legend. Supporting documents
will be placed into the appropriate government files to support the
legend. The intelligence agencies may have several intact legends for
different personalities of a slave. The intelligence term is NOTIONAL.
It roughly means a fictional entity for the sake of an intelligence
operation. Notional organizations are created to steal strength away
from sincere organizations. If a church (or non-CIA KKK group etc.) gets
too sincere and powerful, a well-financed notional rival will start up,
and then later fold under scandal. The net effect is to destroy the
entire cause. At least half of the therapists helping Monarch slaves in
the authors area are programmed multiples themselves! The therapeutic
community is heavily infiltrated. The help lines for women in crisis are
all dirty. Some of the Christian groups that claim to help SRA victims
are really fronts.
One recovering Monarch slave
tells about how her father was the mayor of an important city in
Pennsylvania. He was part of the Illuminati and he introduced drugs
into his area, and had a monopoly on illegal drugs in the area. As mayor
he established the first drug hot line, so that people could inform
authorities about drug trafficking. He staffed the drug hot line with
his own people and this allowed him to get tips to eliminate his
competition. The intelligence agencies which are using mind-control are
hiding their drug trafficking and criminal activities. One of the ways
they do this is the so-called War on Drugs. The situation is so bad and
widespread that even the controlled media has had news where they
reported CIA agents smuggling drugs seized in South America into the
U.S. using government channels.
When a slave is being
programmed, the abusers will use schools, churches, Big Brothers, Boy
Scouts and other activities to carry out the abuse and programming.
Children pulled from classes will be given back-up amnesia so that they
forget that they forgot. In other words, they are totally unaware that
they have lost time when they were pulled out of the classroom.
The teacher gives them a test
score, and they are told they took a test during the missing time. How
can the front alters deny it, when they have been hypnotized to believe
it and they can see the test scores? Alter boys and boys at catholic
orphanages have a record of being used by dirty priests.
Recently,
numerous priests have been discovered molesting children, and hundreds
of lawsuits are underway, but it is still not coming out that this abuse
is connected to trauma-based mind-control. In the past, if the parents
who were part of the Illuminati elite, but were not religious wanted
their boy programmed, they could send him off to a military school run
under the cooperation of the Catholic church and units such as the 6th
U.S. Army, which became one of the primary infiltrated units. The 6th
army uses the magical hexagram as its logo. This would provide the
programmed child with a religious front. He could say, I went to
catholic school. The programming could be disguised as discipline, etc.
The establishment media have
worked propaganda wonders for the abusers of the Monarch Mind-control.
Britain is extremely repressive in their information control. If any
news medium tries to leak the most simplest of information a secret
document called a "notice will be sent at any time of day to them from a
D-notice committee, and the media will have to stop whatever reference
is deemed a secret. In the U.S. it in effect works as tight, it just is
not officially as tight. The abusers know that they
also have an Incredulous Factor that can assist them.
Who would
believe that a sweet child drinks blood and is cannibalistic? The more
that they can do that is far fetched, the less credibility the child has
if they do talk. Some children do try to talk. One Monarch slave talked
at age five, and her entire family came down hard on her and blamed the
childs talking for the death of one of the abusers. What kind of proof
can a child bring that adults will accept? In the McMartin Preschool
case about 800 children were witnesses whose stories corroborated the
SRA and programming that was done, but the media, and the judicial
system were able to cover up the abuse and make it look on television
that the abusers were the victims! It wasnt until after the case was
over and the property sold, that the tangible proof (the secret tunnels
with paraphernalia) were found, and then the news media has covered that
up too. The abusers will often wear masks and costumes.
Lets say a
programmer wears a Mickey Mouse outfit, and the child would remember and
tell, Mickey Mouse hurt me. Now who is going to believe the child? The
child has told the truth, but will be reprimanded for telling the truth.
It doesnt take long for a severely abused child, who has been
programmed to keep silent, to learn that no one wants to hear the truth
anyway.
THE USE OF RELIGIOUS FRONTS
A great deal of Monarch
programming and slave abuse, (as well as the drug trade) is done under
three major covers or fronts:
-
Religious Fronts
-
the
Front of National Security and the Military, and the Entertainment
fields, especially the Country Western Industry, the Rock Music Industry
and Hollywood
-
The religious fronts were popular for centuries,
especially when groups like the Jesuits, the Assassins, and other groups
held immense power
-
Religious fronts are still being used such as J.Z.
Knight, Elizabeth Claire Prophets CUT church, the Church of
Scientology, the Charismatic movement, Jim Jones & Jonestown, and David
Koreshs group etc.
-
Billy
Ray Moores Lords Chapel is entirely a mind-control operation
-
There is
a nondenomination Pentecostal church in southern Washington whose entire
membership is Satanists under mind-control
-
Various overseas
missionary groups are covers for the CIA & mind-control
It would take
a book to explain how these religious fronts are part of the total
trauma-based mind-control and how they operate to protect mind-control,
however there are publications which go into some of the CIA connections
to these groups. It is suggested that interested persons read these
publications. Some of the deceptions such as the lone assassin idea have
been used for centuries as a cover for assassinations planned by the
occult hierarchy. If we are going to really reveal how the Monarch
Mind-control is done, we will have to explain how the deception is done.
If one describes a chameleon only by saying it is like a lizard,
without mentioning the camouflage, then the most important part has been
overlooked.
Religious fronts are an important part of the Illuminati
program for making slaves. In fact, due to their gnostic philosophy of
balancing their good deeds with their bad deeds, it is almost essential
to have a religious front through which one can do good deeds. Even
though adding this section to the book will spur some to blindly lash
out at the book, still the whole story needs to come out. When we, the
authors of this book, write that the Monarch-type total mind-control
threatens everything this nation stands for, we are not exaggerating.
The Monarch Mind-control program has not been used just to program
slaves--but it has been part of a much bigger deception.
When this
deception is realized by this nation, it will shatter the very fabric of
trust that Americans have in their institutions. If Americans will begin
to understand the power structure behind their institutions, and who
controls this structure, they will begin to see the
lies in the scripts that they have been fed since infancy. And YOU, the
reader of this next section in this book, if you love the truth, can
help begin the healing process to overcome some of the devastation that
is going to rock this nation when the truth comes out.
This next section
will help both Christian and non-Christian reader. The therapist can
learn about what is happening so that they can better deal with what the
SRA survivors are beginning to reveal. The grooming of the American
people to believe massive amounts of lies did work, UNTIL a few loving
therapists, ministers, and doctors began to liberate victims of the
Monarch trauma-based mind-control. These programmed multiples began
revealing a horror story of deception unparalleled in history.
For the reader to deal with the next section means courage. It means
that the reader will have to muster up some of the same type of love of
truth that the mind-control survivors must muster to free themselves of
the lies of their satanic programming. What we see and hear can be
programming, in the same way SRA victims are deceived.
Everyone in the
Illuminati of any significance has participated in grooming the public
to believe that Billy Graham is a great man of God. Graham has stood
beside each of the Presidents and the Pope. The Illuminati dont just
program individuals, they program whole nations. The public has been led
to believe in a television image. But what if the secular medias image
of Billy Graham is not real? For Christians it means that they can quit
trusting in a man, and place their trust fully on God. For secular
readers, they can begin to see the extent of how Americas institutions
have been corrupted by the horrible trauma-based mind-control. The
heart-beat of the Body of Christ is crying out that something is
terribly wrong. We will address that.
All of us, whether Christian or
not, must step out of the lies and look clearly out into the darkness
and see every facet of this evil mind-control. When men who worship the
god of this world place In God We Trust on the Federal Reserve bank
notes, we who know the truth must step out of our dream world and
realize that they mean Lucifer. (By the way,
the Federal Reserve is not
a government agency, but a private banking institution of the
Illuminati. This has been documented in a number of writings.) The issue
at hand in this next section is to show how the institution called the
Christian church, and the world in general has been deceived by a
programmed multiple and this trauma-based mind-control.
Secular readers
will be shown that the doctrines that Christians want to believe in,
have been subtly destroyed under the disguise of building them up. This
is no different than the destruction of the positive values which hold
any group together. (After the repeated collaboration by essentially all
the Christian churches worldwide in many activities as the NCC, the
Billy Graham Crusades, the Promise Keepers and other programs, the
Christian churches, Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant & non-denominational
can be considered one institution.) The infiltration and control of the
Christian religion has been one of the easiest tasks of the Illuminati.
The Christian churches are what the intelligence agencies called SOFT
TARGETS.
THE DECEPTION OF BILLY
GRAHAM, A MIND-CONTROL FRONT
In 1992, Billy Graham
broadcast all over the U.S. his radio show called Embrace America 2000.
In the Louisiana area, it came over the KJAM Lafayette Station. During
the show, Billy Graham told the American people we need to embrace the
New World Order. Billy Graham is also on record stating that people can
have salvation through paganism (another name for witchcraft). For
instance, in McCall Magazine (Jan. 1987) Graham stated,
"I used to believe that pagans in far-off countries
were lost--were going to hell. I no longer believe that. I believe that
there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God--through
nature, for instance."
Pagans believe that salvation can be
obtained through nature. This is not a pleasant story. Billy Graham has
been built up to be the most respected popular person in America, Who
wants to find out they have been deceived? We will try to give you the
facts, or evidence, and may God grant you wisdom as you read this. This
section is not propaganda for our own personal views. Years ago, when
Fritz set out on his search, he had no final outcome in mind. Fritz
isnt concerned with concealing facts one way or the other. There is no
desire to stampede our readers any where. We do want to clarify many
issues. We do want to help the truth seeker. But the co-authors
personally have no battle to win, except that truth be brought forth.
The issues at stake are not trivial. Historically, Billy Grahams
deception is one of the "greatest" deceptions that has ever been
perpetrated.
Some might argue the greatest, making Benedict Arnold,
Quisling, and the Trojan Horse pale into insignificance. Allow us to
introduce you just briefly into the world of the Illuminati, All top
hierarchy Satanists are required to have covers, The Illuminatus will
have multiple personalities, and he or she will have one personality
that is particularly shown to the outside world. They (the Programmers,
handlers and the Illuminati councils) try to get the best covers that
they can. They like to be clergymen, but they are also mayors of big
cities, lawyers, doctors, etc.
A Christian psychiatrist who has worked
with numerous victims of Satanism and Multiple Personality Disorder
wrote this observation after having worked with a large number of
ex-multi-generational programmed Satanic multiples, "Some satanists have
invaded the church as it is the perfect cover for them. They masquerade
as angels of light and gravitate towards positions of leadership in
order to have more influence. Because much of what they say is sound
doctrinally, they are rarely detected. Most survivors whom I have worked
with had satanist parents who were in high positions in churches; many
were pastors." (Dr. Fox, Loreda. The Spiritual and Clinical Dimensions
of Multiple Personality Disorder. Salida, CO: Books of Sangre de Cristo,
p. 196.)
Let us repeat what Dr. Loreda Fox said,
"Most survivors whom I
have worked with had satanist parents who were in high positions in
churches; many were pastors."
She didnt say "some," she said
MOST.
Independently, we have discovered the very same thing. People dont
grasp that just because a preacher can sincerely preach what seems a
"perfect sermon," doesnt mean that he cant also be part of the Satanic
hierarchy. What is happening with the Illuminatis ability to create
programmed multiples is that we are getting perfect preachers who are
secret hierarchy members.
Some of their "perfect sermons" are full of
slides, such as "the Christian people need to get involved in the voting
process. Christians love to hear such things, it tickles their ears, but
the truth is that the entire voting process has been captured and
corrupted. Voting machines have repeatedly been exposed to have been
rigged, and the controlled media and public denial have prevented
Americans from giving up their myth that the common mans votes run this
nation. (The subject of election corruption is dealt with in Fritzs
newsletters, etc.)
In Fritzs Be Wise As Serpents book (which exposed
Billy Graham as a Luciferian in 1991), it is explained that high level
Satanism is Gnosticism which requires that "the Force" of these great
satanic magicians be balanced. In other words, in high level Satanism
your good deeds must balance your evil deeds. People do not realize that
unless someone does "good" deeds they cannot be a high level Satanist.
That is why some of the greatest philanthropists are
also our leading national satanists, To see Billy Graham do something
commendable does not disqualify him from satanism. In fact, it is a
requirement if hes been part of the Illuminati, such as
ex-insiders/witnesses say he was. In fact, it wasnt until working on
this book that an eyewitness to the mind-control abuse of at the hands
of Billy Graham offered to help contribute to this section of the book.
In other words, an eyewitness helped write this.
This eyewitness
account by the Co-author matches what the list of eyewitnesses that
Fritz assembled in 1993 have said, But the eyewitness went further and
exposed B.G. crusades skillful use of Monarch slaves to launder drug
money. Several police officers have stated that today, there is for all
practical purposes no police training helping police to understand
Satanism. They are highly trained in many areas, but Satanism is
avoided. When an SRA case involving multiplicity in Olympia, WA recently
happened, the police who investigated the case found that they were
treated as international experts in satanism by other policemen.
They
themselves knew that they knew very little. Where are the experts to
teach us about how the Illuminati functions? Where are the experts who
know who are in the Illuminati? There is no college open to the public
that teaches Advanced Illuminati Studies 401, and gives degrees in
Satanism. The expert witnesses are those who have managed to leave the
Illuminati and Satanism, and stay alive long enough to talk. But the
other side will argue, how can we verify the testimony of your witnesses
Fritz? Remember what happened to over 100 people who had some type of
knowledge about the Kennedy assassination? Jim Marrs in his book
Crossfire on the Kennedy Assassination lists 103 people who were key
figures in knowing about the assassination who have died, many in
circumstances that indicate assassination.
The story we are dealing with
here is just as sensitive to the elite as Kennedys assassination,
because it involves their preparations for the creation of a false
Christ, called by Christians
the AntiChrist, who will be the master
handler/programmer. The LIST OF known & credible WITNESSES If the
authors were to call my list of witnesses up to the witness stand -- which
I cant for it would be a death sentence to many of them, the list would
include:
-
1 Council of Foreign Relations member, who is secretly against the New
World Order
-
1
National Security Agency person, who is against the New World Order
-
1 CIA high level administrator
-
2 Satanists, still in covens, but unhappy enough with the situation to
talk
-
4 ex-Satanists, 3 of which are eyewitnesses, all Christians now
-
2 ex-New Age leaders who worked with the Conspiracy, both became
Christians
-
1 ex-33° Mason, now a Christian
-
Various Christians who have worked with Billy Graham, Pastors, etc.
-
Various therapists working with SRA victims The man who ran Security at
the Sacramento Crusade
-
Alice Braemer, a woman who worked as a secretary for Jeanne Dixon
None, except for a couple of exceptions, none of these people knew
anything about what the other witnesses (sources) had said.
The high degree of
validation and collaboration that separate testimony by witnesses who
have never seen each other and live in different parts of the country is
very powerful. There are several questions that pop up into peoples
minds who are not familiar with who Fritz is, and are not familiar with
these witnesses.
The type of worries some readers could be naturally
having might be: But how are we, the readers, to know how accurate these
people are? Are they trustworthy? Do they have a reputation for honesty?
Could they possibly be giving false information to discredit a great man
of God? These kind of questions can be natural questions for people
unfamiliar with how this information was obtained. But we assure you,
that what we pass on from these eyewitnesses can be relied upon. None of
these worries have any substance to them, because the manner in which
Fritz came to find out about Billy Graham has generally been while he
was researching other things related to the Illuminati. The author has
not been out to build a case, the case has built itself from numerous
detached witnesses who have nothing to gain by telling what they know.
These witnesses have not come to Fritz to feed him bogus information.
Just the paper trail on Billy Graham is very revealing in itself.
Generally the information of these witnesses has been confided by these
witnesses to their trusted friends. Initially, these witness have had no
idea that the information they confided in their trusted close
associates would go beyond their most trusted friends. These trusted
friends then have had permission to let me contact them or find out
their information. The reason why these people are believable is that
the information they reveal could get them killed, and second, the
manner and circumstances of how the information has originally unfolded
has never been in any fashion or method that could be construed as an
attempt to give false information.
CLARIFYING WHAT IS LOOKED FOR IN PROOF?
Too
many people are considered guilty unless proven innocent--which means
that a legitimate search for truth has NOT taken place.
On the flip side, we must bear in mind
that hidden information that has laid dormant for years may totally
reverse our understanding of something. Exceptional circumstances may
surprise us, If some item does not lend itself to totally irrefutable,
totally unqualified claims, then knowing this, the proper investigator
uses words like "almost certainly" and ,,most likely". If the
investigator feels strongly that everything is totally clear, he may
declare that something is correct "without qualification." This is the
nature of proof. We need to understand the qualifications and
reservations that often are attached to evidence or conclusions.
But we
certainly do want to press our investigations as far as possible to get
as many "unqualified" conclusions as possible. Of course, by the time we
write this, we have already done our investigating, and have one
conclusion without any qualification: Billy Graham is working for the
Satanic Hierarchy. We want to try to introduce the material in such a
way that you will get some sense of the search, so that you will not
simply accept our conclusion but will make rational spirit-led
critically-thought-out decisions about Billy Graham. So for the sake of
the readers investigation, please, let us unshackle ourselves from our
prejudices and preconceived labels. Let us suspend our judgment about
Billy Graham one way or the other, until we have thoroughly studied,
prayed and gained discernment about this. It might be interesting to get
some of the Masons, who casually without realizing what they were
saying, have talked about Billy Grahams membership, or other aspects of
his Masonic involvement.
Its doubtful that such men would be of any
value on the witness stand. Their numerous Masonic oaths to lie and
conceal Freemasonry under penalties of gruesome death would tend to have
more influence on them than swearing on a Bible. (See Duncans Masonic
Ritual book, p. 30 for the 1st Degree oath.) This type of witness,
because they talked accidentally and casually are very valuable witnesses
to whoever accidentally hears them, but unfortunately they must be assumed
to be still loyal to the Masonic Lodge and would be hostile witnesses
that will not cooperate. If this were an actual court of law,
depositions of Billy Graham s staff could be taken, so that it could be
revealed to the court how many times they have lied.
By showing their lies, their testimony would be impeached and Christians
would realize that Billy Grahams staff have played a major role in the
deception.
This article will put forth evidence that impeaches the
testimony of Billy Grahams staff. We must refer readers to the
Be Wise As Serpents book and other writings of Fritz for more
information. Also some other books will be named too. Because these
leaders are corrupt, they have been participating in the mass deception
of the world about what Billy Graham does and who he is. In fact, if
this were a court of law all types of people could be subpoenaed to
take depositions, and we might find out many more things than we already
know.
THE MOTIVATION OF THE CO-AUTHORS
Many people, who like Billy Graham, have imputed evil motives to anyone
exposing Billy Graham. As the Scripture say at one point, "Am I to
become your enemy because I tell you the truth?" The story about Billy
Graham and his life-long career for the Illuminati is not an easy thing
for us to write. We do not enjoy speaking negative things against
people. We do enjoy speaking positive things about people. And yet no
man, no servant of God is above reproach. We can personally have an
inner peace that what we have done was what we should have done.
Something needs to be done to wake mankind up before its too late.
CLARIFYING WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE TESTIMONY
In
some subjects, going to the encyclopaedia or almanac will settle
questions. In dealing with the Illuminati and high levels of the occult
world -- unless the investigator is willing to listen to eye-witness
testimony, he or she will get nowhere. There is rarely any written
record of their secret activities. But how much stock can be put in
eye-witnesses? Many people up to now have criticized Fritz for using
eye-witnesses. But remember that if we did manage to get some paper
trail or books on the subject, that book paper trail would not be
acceptable in court, or even if allowed would not be as important as our
eyewitnesses. In court, the written records can be introduced along with
the person who recorded them.
In other words, the personal witness is
still important even with written documents.
The testimony of our
eyewitnesses expose Billy Grahams mind-control activities. Still, we
want to bear in mind that witnesses have varying degrees of credibility
and knowledge. The qualifications of witness in relation to what they
are testifying is important. But to simply dismiss all these witnesses
because they are not paper is simply to cut ourselves off from many
valuable sources of information. In accumulating evidence, the
researcher will come upon two types of information. One is prearranged
evidence and the other is called casual evidence.
Casual evidence is
evidence that has just happened to appear by accident. An actual example
is when friends of mine met a total stranger who happens to be a Mason
and he offhandedly talks about Billy Graham being a Freemason. Casual
evidence is simply evidence that happens without the interested party
having anything to do with it surfacing. Finding casual evidence is
generally "luck", In this case, Fritz has bumped into a great deal of
casual evidence, simply because he had his eyes open and has been
investigating this area for several years. Because of the situation
today in this nation, there is little chance to get a proper hearing of
this information. In terms of the future, indeed, the backlash from this
book may silence us. The truth will still remain, even if we and the
other witnesses dont. We can draw conclusions about ducks from studying
various types of ducks.
I can not draw conclusions about radios from
studying ducks, I can generalize about American made cars, but I cant
include in my generalization about American cars an ox-cart in India.
This may sound basic, and it is, yet people try to generalize by lumping
the generational Satanists in with everybody else, and it just doesnt
work. They also try to draw conclusions about the Freemasons on the
basis of what the Rotary Club they belong to is like and it just doesnt
work. In terms of trying to get a proper hearing today, one of the
barriers is that people use their own experiences to draw conclusions.
People have nothing in their experience to allow them to draw
conclusions about the Illuminati programmers/handlers who are moral
degenerates and programmed multiples, who will do anything, in spite of
their nice fronts.
The policies of DECEPTION by
the Billy Graham Crusade staff
In 1992, a Christian named
Richard Bennett, a friend of Fritzs confronted the Billy Graham Crusade
staff. What he was concerned about was the Billy Graham crusade policy
(that has been in place since the 50s) of sending Catholics that come
forward back to Catholic churches. Documentation shows that the
deception is worse than that, new believers that have never gone to any
church are sometimes referred by the Billy Graham counsellors to the
Catholic Church. Now, why would Richard and Fritz be concerned about
the
Catholic Church?
Richard Bennett was a priest from Ireland who worked at
the Vatican, before giving his life to Christ. He knows how the Catholic
hierarchy prevents people from realizing what they have in Christ. For
those who have read Fritzs Be Wise As Serpents book chapter 2.2 you
know that Fritz is very concerned when anyone gives their allegiance to
a power structure that is part of the NWO and part of its Monarch
trauma-based total mind control. Not everything about the Catholic
church is wrong. Yet, the Billy Graham Crusade could never get the
support it gets from conservative Christians if Billy Grahams staff
didnt lie about where Crusade converts are sent.
What Richard and Fritz
were concerned about was that new Christians would be sent to Catholic
churches, which now are teaching Zen Buddhism, New Age things, not the
salvation by grace that these new Christians need. Granted the
enthusiasm of these new Christians might infuse some life into the
Catholic church, but a babe in Christ is defenceless. He needs nurture,
and the chance to grow. It isnt meant for new Christians to be thrown
to the wolves. Anyway, last Spring and Summer, the Billy Graham Crusade
Executive committee was confronted face to face with the evidence of
what the Billy Graham Crusade in Sept. 93 was going to do. Actually,
more people than Richard did confront them, but Richard is one of the
most knowledgeable ministries to the Catholics in this area.
What the
Billy Graham Crusade Executive Committee told Richard Bennett was that
he had nothing to worry about. That the crusade would never send anyone
to a Catholic church, but that if new converts wanted to go there on
their own, that was their own choice. Four Catholic leaders sat on the
Executive Committee for the 92 Portland Crusade -- Chancellor Mary Joe
Telly, a deacon and two priests. On the Catholic radio station, (and we
have it recorded,) Mary Joe Telly of the Billy Graham Executive
Committee along with another Bishop Wall Schmidt told the Catholic
listeners not to worry that if they came forward they would be
guaranteed that they would be referred back to a Catholic church. They
gave the assurance four times in that talk show. They said that the
decision to send people who came forward to Catholic churches was firm
because it had come right from the very top. This was 6 p.m KVDM
Portland station.
Our recording of this is a record of just one of
thousands of lies that the Billy Graham Crusade people have told
Christians over the years. In fact, from the evidence it appears the
Billy Graham Crusade people say whatever they have to, regardless of the
truth. In the North Star Baptist, Nov. 1964 there was article by Japheth
Perez, who as a convert in the NY 1957 Billy Graham Crusade and a
brand-new Christian, was sent to a Catholic church by the Billy Graham
Crusade. Ian Paisley wrote this comment about Billy Grahams staff: "Dr.
Graham did not reply. He never does reply to letters like this. He
states he never defends himself. He does have a staff, however, who are
paid to defend him and who are never hampered by facts or bothered by
ethics or logic in carrying out their duties. One of the group, George
L. Edstrom, replied. The Jesuits themselves could not give a finer
example of casuistry than his. It is thoroughly dishonest and deceitful,
...
However, since this technique of deceit by misdirection, this
failure to face up to the issues, this disregard of fact, and this
blasphemous attempt to identify Dr. Grahams official connection with
infidels and his flattery and endorsement of them with our Lords
ministry to publicans and sinners is so typical of the Graham
organization..." In Fritzs June 93 Newsletter From A Christian
Ministry, a letter from Graham s staff was reproduced with a point by
point exposure of its lies. Christians are really not well aware of what
the Billy Graham Crusade does. We quote a paragraph from a letter sent
to Billy Graham clear back in the 1950s by a Pastor who, grieved by what
Billy Graham was doing to the harvest field, said: "Some people say that
if you have just one convert in an evangelistic campaign, it is worth
the meeting. That is not true.
The evangelist, as the pastor and
teacher, is given to the Body of Christ. The real test of an
evangelistic campaign is not how many people are converted but what kind
of a spiritual condition does it leave in a community. Billy Graham is
not only failing in the number of people he leads to the Lord Jesus
Christ in this day when hearts are hungry and most people are afraid of
what may happen in the world and when it is easier to get people
converted than it ever has been in my lifetime, but Billy Graham is
pulling the limbs off of the evangelistic trees and the orchard is being
left in bad condition. As we have often said, the real test of an
evangelist is not just how many converts he has but does he leave the
orchard in condition so it will keep bearing fruit."
