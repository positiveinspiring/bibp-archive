The source of most if not all our woes, revealed
(from the present to the past):
Connecting the dots through ~3000 years of
revisionist human history, spanning from the time of the pharaohs, all the
way up to the present dynasties creating the
New
World Order, in a quest to perfect the enslavement of mankind.
From pirates to banksters, to
the
ruling elite, who run the
world's finances,
the media and cover both side of nearly
every conflict or war: the world may make more sense after watching this.
A marathon of an education, that weave a solid
quilt from history-as-we-didn't-know-it.
Learn who really controls the "Empire of the
City"; take an eye-opening journey into the life and times of Jesus and a
crash course in REAL American history.
As huge as the terrain of this
ambitious documentary is, its creator (a
Woman...!) does a breathtaking job of
bringing world history into perspective - from bloodlines to banksters to
today's billionaires.
