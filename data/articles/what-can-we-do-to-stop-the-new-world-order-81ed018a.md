What
can we do to stop the NWO?
(knowledge is Power, Spread
the Knowledge)
Knowledge is Power, Spread the Knowledge
This Awareness indicates this is
the big $ 64.00 question. There is no sentence, there is no paragraph, there
is no reading that will serve as an answer to that question. This Awareness
indicates what is stopping them right now is the fact that the masses still
have some 75 million guns and that the masses do not fully trust the government,
do not trust the government to represent the people, and the Patriot groups
are growing stronger.
These are the main things that are
stopping the New World Order planners. They are desperate trying to find ways
to diffuse the information coming out against them. They are also trying to
find ways to disarm the militia and the citizens of the country. This Awareness
indicates that it is still a struggle, and it cannot simply be answered by
a question to this Awareness. It is something that is happening.
This Awareness indicates this is
likened unto asking during the middle of World war ll: "What can be done
to end this war?" The question seems to be meaningful, but there is not
some answer for such a question. The answer that, "Well, they're working
on an atomic bomb" would not actually answer the question as it was intended,
for the ending of World war ll, because it is not a question of what will
end this war, or what will be done in the conclusion of this war; it is a
question: "What can be done to end this war?" with the implication
being: "What can we as entities do?"
Each person
becoming aware adds to the power of the masses
This Awareness indicates that each
entity, by being aware, adds to the power of the masses. Entities who are
not aware are simply uninvolved bodies, human meat on the hoof, as they would
say, and they contribute nothing to, or nothing of value to the ending of
the crisis, or to the resolution of the crisis. They are simply there, like
a tree, like a bush. The bushes and the trees in battle, do not play much
of a part. They may be used for entities to hide behind, or they may be slaughtered
during the war, but the bush and the tree have no motivation to do anything
in regard to a battle.
Likewise, entities who do not know
what is going on, who are not aware, are much the same. They may be used,
and they may be slaughtered or victimized, but they do not know why, and they
do not know what they are doing, if they do anything. If they hide the enemy,
if they help the enemy, if they fight the enemy, then perhaps, out of personal
frustration, they may end up doing something to support the masses, but they
do not know what is going on.
The writings
of Thomas Paine helped America win its freedom
This Awareness indicates it is not
the first time that writing, the pen, is used to win a victory. Thomas Paine
and his writings helped to win the Revolutionary War, helped to turn the tide
against the supporters of Britain, and in favor of the Colonies and their
independence.
Knowledge is power:
Get these books!
This Awareness reminds you of two
books:
Treason: The New World Order by Gurudas, and the book
by David Icke:
And the truth shall set you free; these two
books have powerful information. Knowledge is power, and knowledge can help
entities to better improve their lives, and with these books, entities can
help others to have more power also, and the empowerment of the masses is
essential in throwing off the yoke of tyranny.
This Awareness indicates that entities
should not despair, for there is an enormous numbers of people whose interests
lie in preserving the good life for each other, and those who would enslave
the masses are very few, and though they have many who work for them do so
more out of fear than out of desire. They do not desire to enslave their fellow
associates, but will do so because they are afraid that if they do not, they
themselves will suffer greater ills.
This Awareness indicates that gradually,
as the masses awaken, they begin to recognize who their true enemies and oppressors
are, and as these masses awaken, those who reside in positions in between
will come to recognize the power of the masses as being greater than that
of the masters, and their allegiance will change, not to support the masters,
but to work for the masses.
This Awareness indicates that therefore,
it does appear, although it is perhaps too early (reading published in
Revelations of Awareness 94-2 issue no. 428) to say, it does appear that
the masses in the end, will remain in charge and regain the power that has
been designed to them by the Constitution, and those who would destroy the
Constitution and enslave the masses will be out of luck, and will have exposed
themselves for what they are.
A war of
information is occurring
This Awareness indicates that it
does appear that this should not be construes as telling people that they
can forget and relax, that all is well, for all is not well yet. You are involved
in a war of information, it is not a shooting war as yet. It may ever become
a shooting war, for the information that is spread to awaken the masses may
be sufficient to ward off any shooting war, and to keep the masses free from
oppression.
This Awareness indicates changes
occur, decade after decade. They occur so slow and so subtle, that sometimes
entities are not aware of the changes until they look back over months, years
or decades and see how much has occurred in the way of change. This Awareness
indicates that entities should not be discourages, should not be depressed
by the continual threats of conquest by those who would subjugate the masses,
for this has always gone on in humanity, but there are always those shining
moments and pages in history where entities have thrown off the yoke of oppression
and found moments of glory and freedom and expression, and these have grown
more and more frequent as the centuries have passed.
