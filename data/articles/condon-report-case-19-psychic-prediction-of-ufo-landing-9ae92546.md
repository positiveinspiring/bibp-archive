Abstract:
A project investigator was at the site of a predicted UFO landing. The landing did not occur.
Background:
This investigation was made in response to a unique sighting prediction based on alleged telepathic contacts with UFOs. The prediction came from a man who claims to have psychic abilities. He declared that his past predictions had been accurate, and he was confident that this one would produce positive results, specifically an UFO landing at a racetrack on a given day at 11:00 a.m.
On the night before leaving for the site, Wadsworth telephoned the predictor to get any additional information he might have. He confirmed the exact time and location of the predicted landing and stated that he had received "a very strong indication" that the event would occur. He assured us that we would not be disappointed. The purpose, he claimed, was "just to show us" that UFOs are real. He said that only one "saucer" would appear.
Investigation:
Wadsworth was met in the state capital city by two officers of the highway patrol. Patrol cars and a small aircraft were provided for the trip to the site.
Weather in the capital was clear; however, a squall front was moving into the racetrack area. When the party arrived at the racetrack at 10:15 a.m., the weather was still clear. The patrol plane was circling overhead. Wadsworth decided that the best place to wait would be the center of the large circular track. (There are two tracks at the raceway: one is straight and runs NW-SE; and adjacent to it is a large circular track which, as seen from the air,
would be a possible target area.) Before landing the plane, the pilot directed the patrol car to the center of the circle by radio. The predictor had been very definite about 11:00 as the time for the event to occur. In his own words, the UFO would appear exactly at 11:00 a.m.
At 11:00 nothing unusual was noted. The front was still moving in; rain began at 12:00 noon. At 12:30 p.m. the group left the area.
