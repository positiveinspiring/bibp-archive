Introduction
As an amateur researcher and writer, with perhaps too much time on his hands, I am fortunate to be able to devote many hours a day reading books and online articles relating to what I will call in this essay the Luciferian Conspiracy.
I make no pretensions that what follows is in any way original or even innovative.
Most of it excepting my own personal observations can be found in much greater detail elsewhere, and for that purpose, I have included a full bibliography and reference section at article's end.
What I have tried to do here is collect information gleaned from reading the work of such exceptional researchers as

...and create a condensed summary of evidence which will show that as it says in the Bible verse above, Lucifer is amongst us, and the mayhem and chaos we are now experiencing on an international scale in this the first decade of the 21st century, is due to the culmination of many millennia of plotting and planning by the eternal adversary as mentioned in the holy scriptures. If only four years ago, someone had made a similar assertion to me as that above, I would have raised an eyebrow or two, and politely or not, dismissed the idea.
But all of my research these past few years has led me to believe just that; That Lucifer is real, and is here on earth, in this dimension, and through those who descend directly from his line, and their puppets, he is causing havoc and chaos in an attempt to seat himself, or his proxy on the throne of a World State, and to inaugurate a New Religion with himself it's sole deity. During my investigations into the Illuminati Brotherhood and their diabolical machinations to cull and enslave mankind, I had until quite recently been oblivious to an aspect of the Global Conspiracy which in it's breadth, depth and scope is like no other. I am speaking about the New Age Movement and it's plan to introduce a World Religion.
I have tried to be as brief and to the point as possible, and hope the reader will have the patience to stick with me.
My ultimate intention here is to lead people to the work of those dedicated men listed above, which in turn will help others to truly come to terms with the realisation, that for all it's mystical hype and apparent diversity, what many now refer to as 'The Rainbow Conspiracy' is in reality the 'Luciferian Conspiracy'. Below, I have tried to connect as many of those 'dots' as an article of this type allows, in order to draw a red line through each of the many interconnecting aspects of what the New Age terms 'The Plan' and what Freemasonry calls 'The Great Work Of Ages'.
Call it what you will, by 'essay's end' , it should become obvious that what we are dealing with is Lucifer's rebellion against God.
The Far Pavillions
During the 1960s and '70s, large numbers of disillusioned intellectuals, alienated students and others from the West, traveled to India and other points east seeking "truth, wisdom, enlightenment, and good karma" from a ready made supply of gurus, swamis, yogis, and other self styled "Illuminated masters."
Few understood that they were merely following in the footsteps of a woman who a hundred or so years earlier had trodden a similar path and set out the foundations for the present occult revival being experienced globally, and whose work is pivotal to the spiritual character of the United Nations today and the cause of a World Religion. That woman was Helena P. Blavatsky (1831-1891), widely regarded as the high priestess of the modern New Age Movement. Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society in New York in 1875, and during her lifetime, established close relations with Freemasonry, receiving the Certificate of the 'Rite Of Adoption' from Mason John Yarker in 1877.
Blavatsky's Theosophy taught arcane "knowledge" (Gnosis), the universal brotherhood of mankind, and unity among all religions, except the monotheistic religions, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism , which she insisted could not be reconciled with what she termed "individual enlightenment." Blavatsky damned Yahweh as a "capricious and unjust." God. In her view, he was the God of the Israelites and nothing more. She insisted that the Holy Scriptures were wrong, it was really Lucifer who was the 'Good and Just God', victimized by the harsh and unjust Yahweh. Blavatsky maintained that the the name Satan, belonged by right to the first and cruelest "Adversary" of all other Gods, and not to the serpent which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom.
She somehow reasoned that Satan/Lucifer is GOD the creator, the Savior, the Father; and that Jesus is "the first born brother of Satan."
She wrote,
"Satan, the Serpent of Genesis, is the real creator and benefactor, the Father of Spiritual mankind. For it is he ... who opened the eyes of the automaton (Adam) created by Yahweh, as alleged.... An adversary to him ... he still remains in Esoteric Truth the ever loving messenger ... who conferred on us spiritual instead of physical immortality."
She claimed to have had experience with astral projection and the ability to communicate with the spirit world.
Her books, 'Isis Unveiled' and her three-volume, 'The Secret Doctrine' were supposedly channeled through her by the "Masters of Wisdom," Tibetan 'holy men', which any Christian, Jew or Muslim should recognize as being synonymous with demons. In her book, 'The Secret Doctrine' Blavatsky wrote,
"Lucifer represents life, thought, progress, civilization, liberty, independence. Lucifer is the Logos, the Serpent, the Saviour" and "It is Lucifer who is the God of our planet and the only God".
She continues,
"The celestial Virgin which thus becomes the Mother of Gods and Devils at one and the same time, for she is the ever loving beneficent deity, but in antiquity and reality, Lucifer or Luciferius is the name. Lucifer is the divine and terrestrial light, the Holy Ghost and Satan at one and the same time".
When Blavatsky died in 1891, Annie Besant, a militant feminist, co mason, and a member of the Fabian Socialist Society of England took over the reigns of leadership.
As a close friend of George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and other leading Fabians, she was in an excellent position to disseminate theosophical ideas in some very influential circles.
She took part in revolutionary street riots and wrote numerous occultic works to complement those of Blavatsky. After Besant, came Alice Bailey and her husband, Foster Bailey, a 32nd Degree Freemason. Having assumed the leadership of the Theosophical Society together, they formulated and built the foundations of what we now refer to as the New Age Movement. They made no effort to conceal their demonic sympathies, and created the 'Lucifer Publishing Company', along with the theosophical periodical 'Lucifer'.
Acknowledging that the Christian world at that time, had not been sufficiently undermined for their open preference for the Satanic religion, they renamed their project the 'Lucis Publishing Company'.
In 1922, they set up 'Lucis Trust', which continues to serve as the umbrella organization for a multitude of One World Government/New Age/Occult sects, cults, organizations and programs that are the main players in the emerging new world religion.
These include the:

The 'Plan' as revealed by her 'Ascended Master' Djwhal Khul, is documented in her twenty four books, which she says were channeled through her by Khul whilst she was in a trance state. This 'Plan', was to usher in the "Harmonic Convergence," also known as the Omega, Mind Convergence, Fusion or Turning Point, which can occur only when nations put aside their differences in a "New World Order" of global unity. When world government and religion are finally realized, the New Age, or the Age of Aquarius, will have dawned. Only then will the Avatar appear, and the implementation of the New World Order fully begin.
This "Christ" is also known as Lord Maitraya (see below), said to be awaited also by Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, and Hindus, though he is known by these believers respectively as the Messiah, Imam Mahdi, the fifth Buddha, or Krishna. Bailey makes it very clear that there is to also be a world religion:
"The spirit has gone out of the old faiths and the true spiritual light is transferring itself into a new form which will manifest on earth eventually as the new world religion. ...Judaism is old, obsolete and separative and has no true message for the spiritually-minded which cannot be better given by the new faiths...the Christian faith also has served its purpose; its Founder seeks to bring a new Gospel and a new message that will enlighten all men everywhere".

In his book 'Terrorism & The Illuminati', Canadian author, David Livingstone's own investigations revealed that the Lucis Trust is run through an international board of trustees, whose membership is said to have included:

When one examines and researches the claims of the New Age Movement, it is all too easy to be skeptical and dismissive, but those leading the way forward in this modern day version of what is in truth 'Mystery Babylon' renewed, are working hand in glove with the great and the powerful.
Some of the most wealthy and influential men and women on our planet are openly identifying themselves with the New Age. From Bankers, Industrialists, Politicians, Celebrities, it seems everyone is going 'New Age' and they are bringing huge swathes of the population along with them.
This 'spiritual awakening' may be only one aspect of the Illuminati's goal towards One World Government, but it is a major one and may in time prove to be the core element in their plan. It would be foolhardy indeed to ignore the growing influence of the New Age, Occult, Satanist, Wicca, and Hedonist phenomena manifesting themselves all around us, without acknowledging that if these trends persist, the day will not be too far off when these forces will be able to make good on their aims. As G.K. Chesterton once observed,
"If man will not believe in God, the danger is not that he will believe in nothing, but that he will believe in anything."
'The Christ Is Now Here!'
On April 25, 1982, millions of people across the world read the above headline in their daily newspapers, and that,
"Throughout history, humanity's evolution has been guided by a group of enlightened men, the Masters of Wisdom, a Spiritual Hierarchy at the center of which stands the World Teacher, Lord Maitreya, known by Christians as the Christ."
We were told "The Christ" was at that that very time living in the world and would within two months reveal his identity to all mankind. At the same time, the British Theosophist Benjamin Creme commenced a worldwide speaking tour and announced himself spokesman for "the Christ."
In numerous interviews and speeches, he explained that it was not Jesus Christ he was acting on behalf of, but the "Master of Wisdom," of whom Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, and others are disciples. Creme's messianic campaign was coordinated by his New Age religious organization, the Tara Center, from its offices in Los Angeles, New York, and London. As Creme's "Lord Maitreya' failed to appear, one would have expected that he and his 'Christ, along with all his euphoric Aquarian propaganda would have become completely discredited and irrelevant.
But we do not live in an age of reason.
Mr Creme is still revered as a leading light of the vast New Age network, and his arcane gospel can be found around the world at UN conferences and programs where the Illuminati Elite of the,

Many critics of the United Nations have described it as a modern day 'Tower of Babel'. Most were referring to man's act of spiritual arrogance that the book of Genesis tells us earned God's displeasure.
To support such an unflattering characterization today, one might draw attention to the confusing and combustible assortment of tongues, cultures, ideologies, and politics for which the "house of peace" has become justly infamous. The UN, along with its programs and policies, is ever more worthy of comparison to the Tower of Babel, as rampant idolatry and militant paganism thoroughly permeate the organization. The UN is gradually becoming the center of a New World Religion, a strange and evil convergence of New Age mysticism, pantheism, aboriginal animism, atheism, communism, socialism, Luciferian occultism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc...
The followers and disciples of this new faith include:

The Rio Earth Summit
"Thus, the environmental movement, while helping to advance the cause of the oil industry, is an extension of the Aquarian conspiracy, incepted by Alice Bailey, designed ultimately to foster the acceptance a one-world-religion, based on the occult, or the New Age, as it is called". David Livingstone.

David Livingstone.
In his book 'Global Tyranny Step By Step', William F. Jasper writes,
"At the June 1992 UN Earth Summit in Brazil, the official UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) together with the Global Forum "Peoples Summit" showcased a blending of pagan aboriginal rites with an ecumenical collective of 'mystical' and spiritual tenets from East and West to bring into being an unintelligible form of what was called a 'Universal Faith'."
Across the globe, the world media referred to the Rio Declaration and the 800-page blueprint for government action titled Agenda 21 as "sacred" texts.
Al Gore, the leader of the U.S. Senate delegation, called for a new spiritual relationship between man and earth. Actress Shirley MacLaine was in attendance in order to add her own strange brand of psychic spirituality to the proceedings.
Those Ministers from the World Council of Churches present, were there because of their affinity to the ecumenical "spirit" that uses the Hegelian Dialectic to combine a form of Christianity as thesis, with a pagan spiritualism as antithesis, resulting in a synthesis very akin to the Babylonian Mystery Religions.
Another group at the summit, The Union for Natural Environment Protection, an environmental association based in Sao Leopoldo, Brazil, surprisingly declared the following about the true purpose of the W.C. of C's involvement:
"The environmental movement is being used as a cover to promote a return to the creed of the Ancient Mysteries, in the form of the worship of mother-nature, a pagan notion that equates the goddess with earth, known among the ancient Greeks as Gaia. Originally, she is the Babylonian Ishtar, known to the bible as Astarte, or the Egyptian Isis. This pantheistic idea has its origins in ancient paganism, and is central to the Kabbalah and all Western occult tradition, including Freemasonry and the Illuminati. Plato wrote: "We shall affirm that the cosmos, more than anything else, resembles most closely that living Creature of which all other living creatures, severally or genetically, are portion; a living creature which is fairest of all and in ways most perfect." Known as Anima Mundi, the "Soul of the World", it is related to the concept of the Neoplatonists, the Logos, or the Word, also known as the "Son of God", or the ancient dying God"

It should be apparent to the reader that a 'nexus' has been formed, connecting the major players in the push towards the One World Dictatorship, with the United Nations, The New Age Movement, and the 'Greens' all interlocking at the top, with the 'hidden hand' of the Illuminati pulling the strings in the background as the driving force moving us all inexorably towards the New World Order.
The Illuminaries
Canadian Multi Millionaire Industrialist Maurice Strong , a former trustee of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a member of the advisory council of Planetary Citizens, is a major force within the Environmental and New Age Movements.
He sits on the board of directors and serves as director of finance of the Lindisfarne Center, which is located in the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, and its operation all facilitated by grants from the Lilly Endowment, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Rockefeller Foundation.
The Institute numbers among its faculty members the 'Eco-Radical' Amory Lovins and Luciferian Adept and New Age author David Spangler.
We can gain some appreciation as to what is being taught at this Rockefeller funded institute by reading Mr. Spangler's books, such as 'Reflections on the Christ', wherein he writes:
"Lucifer, like Christ, stands at the door of man's consciousness and knocks. If man says, go away because I do not like what you represent, I am afraid of you, Lucifer will play tricks on that fellow. If man says, "Come in, and I will give to you the treat of my love and understanding and I will uplift you in the light and presence of the Christ, my outflow," then Lucifer becomes something else again. He becomes the being who carries that great treat, the ultimate treat, the light of wisdom. The reason man has come to fear Lucifer is not so much that he represents evil as because he represents experience which causes us to grow and to move beyond the levels where we have been.... Lucifer is literally the angel of experience."

...are all listed as being original endorsers of the world-government-promoting Planetary Citizens.
Founded by New Age luminary and former UN consultant Donald Keys, and presided over for many years by the late Norman Cousins (CFR), the Planetary Citizens Organization has brought together and made very good use of the prestige of many leading world figures to support expansion of UN power and it's institutions.
Keys, a self confessed disciple of Alice Bailey, refers to the United Nations as "the nexus of emerging planetary values" and expresses the hope that it will establish a "planetary management system.".(New Age Speak for World Government). Another original endorser of Planetary Citizens was Aurelio Peccei, the founder of the Club of Rome, which although initially recognized for its role in launching "no growth" environmentalism in the 1970s, has 'waxed' increasingly "spiritual" in more recent years. Their quest for spiritual 'wisdom' includes slavish adherence to the Blavatsky mandate dictating that Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are either excluded or denigrated. One of the primary avenues through which this lean toward oriental spiritualism has been spread is the Temple of Understanding, located at the same Cathedral of St. John the Divine that houses the Lindisfarne Luciferians.
Begun in the early 1960s as the "spiritual counterpart of the United Nations," its founding sponsors included the following odd assortment of Establishment Insiders, socialists, humanists, communist fronts, religious figures, and entertainment celebrities:
John D. Rockefeller IV then-Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger IBM president Thomas J.

With people such as the these in the vanguard, the U N's pagan spiritualism will grow ever more overt and assertive.
The UN report entitled 'The New International Economic Order A Spiritual Imperative' proclaims:
"Today a new understanding of spirituality is emerging which recognizes that all efforts to uplift humanity are spiritual in nature."
Alice Bailey said,
"That is spiritual which lies beyond the point of present achievement...." "Given this new understanding of spirituality, the work of the United Nations can be ... seen within the entire evolutionary unfoldment of humanity. The work of the U.N. is indeed spiritual and holds profound import for the future of civilization."

The Pantheistic Smokescreen
"When you worship the sun, moon, stars, a statue, or even yourself, Lucifer is leading you astray. You are not to worship things that were created; instead you are to worship the creator. To worship anything other than the creator is giving heed to Lucifer". Fritz Springmeier 'Be Wise As Serpents'.
"When you worship the sun, moon, stars, a statue, or even yourself, Lucifer is leading you astray. You are not to worship things that were created; instead you are to worship the creator. To worship anything other than the creator is giving heed to Lucifer".
Fritz Springmeier 'Be Wise As Serpents'.
Since "God" in the pantheistic metaphysical system is not the almighty God of the Bible, but an impersonal, immanent force that occupies all things, then all things; the universe itself, every rock, every tree, everything, every man, every woman are "God."
In this pagan world view, man is not a special creation of the one, true God, to whom, ultimately, he is answerable to. Nor is he endowed by his creator with intrinsic, inalienable rights and duties. Thus pantheism "functions as an effective device in the undermining of a God-centered religion by transforming religion into a man-centered belief system, and thereby giving a religious sanction to the doctrines and programs of political collectivism.
Pantheism can be also be utilized as a step towards bringing humanity from theism to atheistic materialism. In religion, pantheism is most often expressed as Naturalism; the doctrine that religious truth is derived from nature, not revelation. The June 1941 issue of the occult journal 'Rosicrucian Digest' predicted that,
"The multiplicity of social states, countries, or nations will cease to be."
That nations would be superseded by "The One United World State."
The Rosicrucian's were correct in concluding that the 'mystical-pantheism' they advocated would, if generally accepted, lead to a collectivist world state. And there are far too few people in the world today who understand the direct cause-and-effect relationship between the two.
Father Clarence Kelly, a noted authority on occult deception writes;
"Pantheism is a favorite doctrine of collectivists, because it offers a concept of man which, on religious grounds, subordinates the individual to the collective."
Hitler And The Vril
It was Neo-Paganism that helped create the conditions which paved the way for the totalitarian collectivism of the Third Reich.
The Nazi high priesthood - Hitler, Himmler, Rahn, Rosenberg, Hess, Feder, Sebot, et al. were all ardent theosophists, and their esoteric societies (the Thule, Vril, Seekers of the Grail) were steeped in the same occultism and pantheism so prevalent in today's New Age and environmental movements. There is a wealth of evidence that Hitler considered himself 'chosen' and he is on record as having said:
"I have seen the 'New Man' and he is indeed terrible".
It is evident that Hitler was deeply involved in the occult and that he believed that his murderous reign of terror was a 'divine' mission on behalf of what he termed the 'Ancient Aryan Masters'.
Dietrich Eckart, a master Adept of the Thule Society and Hitlers' occult mentor, wrote,
"Hitler will dance, but it is I who will call the tune! I have initiated him into the Secret Doctrine, opened his centers of vision and given him means to communicate with the powers".
In the final chapter of his book, 'The Twisted Cross', Joseph Carr draws frightening parallels between Nazism and the New Age Movement:
"One cannot argue against the claim that the Nazi world view and major elements of the New Age Movement are identical. They should be, after all for they both grew out of the same occult root: Theosophy. Their respective cosmogony, cosmology and philosophies are identical".
The New Age and the One World Government conspiracy are intrinsic and inseparable..
Although all the various sects and cults which make up 'Pantheism' may appear diverse and separate, all the basic elements are the same for the various gnostic hierarchical religions, they just have a different focus. They operate off the same principles and cooperate and function together.
What are ostensibly separate and independent religious groups are actually at the very top working together and run by the same cabal in the service of the same master. In his epic work on the One World Religion, 'Be Wise As Serpents' Fritz Springmeier answers the question most of us have asked:
"Do the leaders of the cults know what is going on? In authoritative fashion, Mr Springmeier answers, "Yes, they have been orally, emphasis on that word orally told exactly what is happening. The leaders of the New Age, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Latter Day Saints church know what they are up to, and what their roles are in creating a one-world government."

The Solar Logos
Throughout the Ancient World, the Sun was worshipped in many guises as God.
In Babylon it was Nimrod, in Egypt- Osiris, the Canaanites worshipped Baal and in Greece, it was Apollo. The New Age Sun God is called the 'Solar Logos' or 'The Word' thereby blasphemously counterfeiting the biblical Jesus Christ. In her book, 'Rays and Initiations', Alice Bailey reveals this Solar Logos as Lucifer himself.
Today, as in millennia past, the Sun God is being worshipped by the New Age as divine. David Spangler, refers to the Sun God in these terms:
"The light that reveals to us the path to the New Age 'Christ' comes from Lucifer. He is the light giver. It is his light that heralds for man the dawn of a greater consciousness. The true light of this great being can only be recognized when one's own eyes see with the light of the inner sun. It is an invitation into the New Age "
The ancient doctrine of the Sun God or Solar Logos melds itself easily with Pantheism, which as we have seen is at the moment a core dogma of the New Age.
By denying the existence of a personal God, whilst insisting that the universe itself is God, New Agers declare that as man is part of the universe, man is also God. The Luciferian master plan cannot succeed unless people accept that there is no God who loves and cares for them.
Therefore, accepting that the Moon, the Stars, the Galaxies are all Gods in themselves, the New Age Sun God or Solar Logos as humanity's master becomes a required tenet of belief and we can establish that throughout man's history, all 'Sun God's have been nothing more than guises for the great deceiver, Lucifer. Witches believe that Lucifer is the God of the Sun, and the Sun God is also known as the 'Horned God' (Lucifer is also known as the "Angel of Light"). Many of the Witch's holy days revolve around the Sun such as the Yule.
A large part of their belief system is the concept of the Sun weakening and the world dying, then on the Winter Solstice the Sun God Lucifer is reborn and warms the Earth.
To the Ancient Latin people's, Lucifer was the Sun God, father of Aradia and the brother and lover of Diana. To appreciate how this adversary of God has been able to clandestinely insinuate himself into our lives, we only have to look all around at the plethora of pagan sun symbolism which now proliferate throughout society. One example of this can be found in the world of female bodybuilding, where each year, a trophy shaped in a design used to symbolize the worship of Lucifer is awarded at a major I.F.B.B. women's bodybuilding event.
The meaning of this trophy is hidden from most everyone but a select few who are initiated. The trophy is in the form of an obelisk, which to those unfamiliar is a tapering, four-sided shaft that has a pyramidal top. The obelisk is a symbol that definitely has connections to Freemasonry. The obelisk is important to Masons and has roots in ancient Egypt. It is the symbol of a god worshipped by believers involved in the ancient mysteries.
The obelisk represents the Sun God Lucifer. The sun is also a major Masonic symbol.
Albert Pike, who we deal with below wrote:
"The sun is the ancient symbol of the life-giving and generative power of the Deity."
Ralph Epperson, a historian and lecturer on the subject writes:
"The sun was a symbol of something that only the believers in the religion... understood. These believers, ...knew that the people would not accept their mystery religion, so they had to conceal it from them. So the task became one of creating a religion around a belief that they knew the people would accept. Their basic purpose was to create a popular religion as a cover for their secret worship. They would have to keep their beliefs from the people, and conceal their secret worship in hidden symbols."
Epperson continues:
"The obelisk stands for the very presence of the sun god! And the sun god is Lucifer!"
The World Religion Exposed
"The Gnostic religions are often called pagan. This pagan worship is often the exoteric cover that the first levels are initiated into. The highest level is often the real esoteric worship, and often involves direct Luciferian or Satanic worship. In other words, the Sun worship of the Masons and other groups is a fig leaf for the worship by the highest levels of the Divine Serpent Satan." Fritz Springmeier 'Be Wise As Serpents' "According to Alice Bailey, the Masonic movement will be the religion of the New System. Benjamin Creme, also believes Freemasonry will be the religion of the New Age. Lola Davis, another New Age leader, also sees Freemasonry as the New Age Religion" Texe Marrs: Dark Secrets of the New Age
"The Gnostic religions are often called pagan. This pagan worship is often the exoteric cover that the first levels are initiated into. The highest level is often the real esoteric worship, and often involves direct Luciferian or Satanic worship. In other words, the Sun worship of the Masons and other groups is a fig leaf for the worship by the highest levels of the Divine Serpent Satan."
Fritz Springmeier 'Be Wise As Serpents' "According to Alice Bailey, the Masonic movement will be the religion of the New System. Benjamin Creme, also believes Freemasonry will be the religion of the New Age. Lola Davis, another New Age leader, also sees Freemasonry as the New Age Religion"
Texe Marrs: Dark Secrets of the New Age
Alice Bailey wrote in 1957,
"The Masonic movement... is the custodian of the law; it is the home of the Mysteries and the seat of initiation. It holds in its symbolism the ritual of Deity, and the way of salvation is pictorially preserved in its work. It is a far more occult organization than can be realised, and is intended to be the training school for the coming advanced occultists. In its ceremonials lie hid the wielding of the forces connected with the growth and life of the kingdoms of nature and the unfoldment of the divine aspects in man." "When the new universal religion has sway and the nature of esotericism is understood-will be the utilisation of the banded esoteric organisms, the Masonic organism and the Church organism as initiating centres. These three groups converge as their inner sanctuaries are approached. There is no dissociation between the One Universal Church, the sacred inner Lodge of all true Masons, and the inner-most circles of esoteric societies."

Has Freemasonry been underestimated as a world religion? At least one Masonic author writing to Masons felt that Masonic religious power had been underestimated.
He writes,
"In the past Masonry has been condemned as a shallow substitute for religion. This the Masonic body has always denied but in fact the new age revitalised Masonry will be a paralleling evolutionary way of man's approach to God, and Masonry and religion will gladly cooperate." The Spirit of Masonry, p. 129

Albert Pike (December 29, 1809April 2, 1891). Albert Pike was a Luciferian who confessed Lucifer as his own God see (below quote). He was the former Sovereign General of The Supreme Council Of Grand Sovereign Inspectors, General of the 33rd Degree of The Scottish Rite.
There is also compelling evidence that he founded the Ku Klux Klan... Pike can be justifiably regarded as the most influential Freemason who ever lived. During the American Civil War, he was a confederate general who is said to have committed the most heinous atrocities of the war, yet his tomb is located just thirteen blocks from the Capitol Building in Washington DC. He was a high ranking member of the Illuminati who is still revered by the New World Order Cabal. In his book 'Morals and Dogma', Pike confirmed for posterity that the God of the Illuminati and the New World Order is Lucifer.
He wrote;
"The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine. . . Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonay (Jesus) is also God. For the eternal law is that there is no light without shade, no beauty without ugliness, no white without black, for the absolute can only exist as two Gods: darkness being necessary to light to serve as its foil as the pedestal is necessary to the statue, and the brake to the locomotive. "
Pike asserted boldly and unequivocally in his book that Freemasonry is identical to the ancient mysteries, which clearly means that all their teachings in all their books are precisely the same as the Ancient, Pagan, Satanic Mysteries!
Pike continues in Morals and Dogma:
"The true and pure philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay (Jesus); but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of darkness and evil."
Is Freemasonry The Worship Of Lucifer?
There has been extensive debate as to whom the true god of Freemasonry really is.
Below, I have listed some quotes from Masonic Authorities which will help clarify this piece of the puzzle. It should be understood that most Blue Degree (Symbolic) Masons are not in thrall to Lucifer, but higher level 'initiates' must participate in rituals which involve drinking from skulls whilst kneeling prostrate at a black alter adorned with serpents. We should furthermore take pains to know who Lucifer really is.
The King James Bible records his fall from heaven following his rebellion against God thus:
"How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer, son of the morning! How are thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high, yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit". Isaiah 14:12-15
"How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer, son of the morning! How are thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high, yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit".
Isaiah 14:12-15
The scriptures name Lucifer as,
"That old serpent called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world". Revelation 12:9.
"That old serpent called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world".
Revelation 12:9.
Deception in Freemasonry is witnessed time and again as one goes ever deeper into it's darkness.
Albert Pike in his 'Morals and Dogma' writes,
"Masonry like all the religions, all the mysteries, conceals it's secret from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of it's symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be mislead. The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally mislead by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended he shall imagine he understands them".

Quotes affirming Lucifer as the God of Fremasonry:
"First conjuration address to Emperor Lucifer, Master and Prince of rebellious spirits, I adjure thee to leave thine abode in what ever quarter of the world it may be situated and come hither to communicate with me. I command and I conjure thee in thy name oh mighty living god, to appear without noise". The Book Of Black Magic by Arthur Edward Waite 33rd Degree Mason "I hereby promise the Great Spirit Lucifuge, Prince Of Demons, that each year, I will bring unto him a human soul to do with as it may please him, and in return, Lucifuge promises to bestow upon me the treasures of the earth and fulfill my every desire for the length of my natural life. If I fail to bring him each year the offering specified above, then my own soul shall be forfeit to him". Signed in blood, Manly Palmer Hall 33rd Degree Freemason from his book 'The Secret Teaching Of All Ages' "When the Mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power, he has learned the Mystery of his Craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply this energy". Manly Palmer Hall 33rd Degree 'The Lost Keys Of Freemasonry' " That which we must say to a crowd is; We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition. To you Sovereign Grand Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees. The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initiates of the High degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian Doctrine". Albert Pike 33 rd Degree. " Lucifer, the son of the morning! Is it he who bears the light, and with it's splendours intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish souls? Doubt it not!" Albert Pike 33rd Degree

Freemasonry is truly the worship of Lucifer.
Once this is understood, it becomes clear as to why they have been so anxious all these centuries to keep the lid of secrecy tightly screwed down, for if people really understood that Masonry is a worship of Lucifer, no one would join, and the citizens of most communities would rise up as one to demand that the organization be completely outlawed.
Thus, you have secrets within secrets, wheels within wheels, just as the above quotes confirm.
The Light Bearer Returns
Many believe that the New Age Movement is little more than a collection of old Hippies, Feminists and 'wannabe' mystics chanting and praying to who knows what or why.
But that is so far from the reality of what is a dangerous and desperate situation, as the Illuminati and their co conspirators in the New Age, through use of all the weapons of media control and information available to them, drive their New World Order project to it's logical conclusion, whilst we the people sleep walk into their 'Aquarian' Dictatorship. In his book 'Terrorism and The Illuminati', the Canadian author David Livingstone writes:
"The Illuminati claim to be descended of Fallen Angels, who taught them the "Ancient Wisdom", also known as the Kabbalah, which they have been preserving throughout the centuries. These Fallen Angels are referred to in the Bible, Book of Genesis, as the Nephilim, or "Sons of God", and were said to have descended to earth and intermarried with human beings. Christian interpretations struggle with the passage, choosing to translate the term into "mighty men". However, apocryphal Jewish texts explain that they were the devil and his legions, who were cast out of Heaven, and took wives from the female descendants of Cain. They produced a race known as the Anakim".

It is a well researched hypothesis that it is these 'Anakim' or rather their descendants who now occupy all the positions of real power in our world.
Whether they are truly the children of the Nephilim is irrelevant so long as they themselves believe that it is, and use this assumed 'divine' right to rule in order to justify the increasing oppression, control and terror being enacted on all our lives.
Conclusion
The Luciferian New Age of Aquarius is here right now and mankind has joined in rebellion against it's creator.
We are giving to people, who now publicly exclaim their worship of God and man's greatest and original adversary, free reign to lead us into hell on earth in the shape of a diabolical One World tyrannical state, and the United Nations is the international temple at which humanity, through it's political and religious leaders pays homage to him, the Light Bearer - Lucifer.
"And he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every God, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done." (Dan. 11:36)
