The U.S. government has been scheming on how to provide for continuity of
government for many decades now.
According to Peter Santilli, an informant
who is an ex-marine and worked on portions of the contingency plans known as
Rex 84, civil unrest will come after a financial collapse.
The
Readiness Exercise 1984, a.k.a. Rex 84, outlines continuity of
government wherein the U.S. Constitution is suspended, martial law is declared
and the U.S. military command take over state and local governments in order
to ensure stabilization of our nation at any cost. Any American who is
deemed a national security threat would be detained in an interment or
FEMA camp.
The author of Rex 84 was Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, National
Security Council (NSC) White House aids and NSC liaison to FEMA.
Rex
84 is the plan; the triggers are a
series of executive orders.
It is the continuity of government under specific contingency strategies
that are laid out in various operations guide manuals.
Operation Garden Plot
is a subprogram of Rex 84.
Twice before, Rex 84 was implemented - during the LA riots and on 9/11. In
these scenarios, only small portions of the entire set of documents were
used. Within the series of contingency plans, implementation of them depends
on the severity of the situation.
Some of the plans include internment camps where all or portions of the
active or inactive military bases would be transformed into work camps where
all considered to be dissonant would be held. The NORTHCOM army manuals
clearly state that NATO forces will be used in every phase of the operation.
According to Santilli, procedures to move conventional, chemical and nuclear
bombs across the nation without detection have been facilitated without
notice by the U.S. military.
Back in 1986, during his military service where he was involved with weapons
transportation, Santilli describes how an unmarked refrigerated trailer
driven by a civilian driver was used to transport chemical or conventional
weapons to various strategic bases both above and underground.
Santilli was a specialist in aviation deployed weapons, which made him the
perfect candidate to the assignment of weapons transportation.
The refrigerated truck, allocated by the administration department on base,
was directed to the commissary, where the unsuspecting driver believed that
he was transporting food. The weapon was placed at the head of the trailer,
and covered up with either food stores (like cans of soup) or body bags. In
the event that the truck is stopped en route, the weapon would be well
hidden and go undetected by inspectors on the public highways.
A U.S. Marine Corp bill of lading was the paperwork necessary to move the
commercial refrigerated truck through weigh stations on public highways
without any question. Santilli remembers that there was not one incident
where he had to enact any security measures to ensure the delivery was made.
Santilli, who was assigned to ride in the cab of the truck with the driver,
says that his orders were to make sure the truck arrived at its destination.
He was informed by his superiors that if there were problems concerning
potential civil unrest, he was to radio into his superiors for aid by either
air or ground support.
Should the situation warrant serious attention; crowd control methods would
be implemented.
One possible scenario was the use of cluster bomb units (CBUs) that will
emit upon detonation, a sleep and kill chemical weapon that will not
disturb infrastructure, but is lethal to all living things within the
effected zone. Santilli describes these particular 3 unit CBUs as shaped
like water-heaters with a coned top and plunger-like device.
Once deployed
in the air, a parachute assists these CBUs to the targeted area. And when
detonated, a deadly chemical gas will kill every human and animal in the
specified cordoned area.
This is just one example, says Santilli, as to the lengths the U.S. armed
forces are trained to make sure continuity of government is preserved.
Santilli explained that the use of foreign troops on U.S. soil, as described
in Rex 84 and other subsequent manuals, would have a two-fold purpose.
Firstly, to provide extra security in designated areas, cities or highways;
and secondly, as scapegoats were violent action used against American
citizens should the U.S. military be directed to attack civilians.
The refrigerated truck, carrying the chemical or conventional weapon with
Santilli riding shotgun travelled to underground bases like the one at
Yuma
Proving Ground which is a ammunitions testing range for pilots. Nestled
underneath the ground is a secret military base.
Santilli explains that his knowledge of Rex 84 provides that within the
document, one of the scenarios that would cause a complete suspension of the
U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights and implement martial law would be a
financial collapse.
He says once the collapse occurs, the U.S.
government and defense agencies estimate they have a 72 hour window to
activate all procedures to ensure continuity of government as well as a
lockdown of the general population as civilian unrest, riots and outbreaks
of violence are anticipated.
A source in the Deutsche Bank claims that in 2008 our financial and monetary
system completely collapsed and since that time the banking cartels have
been propping up the system to make it appear as if everything was fine.
In reality our stock market and monetary systems are fake; meaning that
there is nothing holding them in place except the illusion that they have
stabilized since the Stock Market Crash nearly 5 years ago.
Since this time, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in conjunction
with FEMA and other federal agencies have been quickly working to set in
place their directives of control under a silent martial law.
The Deutsche Bank informant says that the cause for the bailout of the banks
was a large sum of cash needed quickly to repay China who had purchased
large quantities of mortgage-backed securities that went belly-up when the
global scam was realized.
When China realized that they had been duped
into buying worthless securitized loans which would never be repaid, they
demanded the actual property instead. The Chinese were prepared to send
their people to American shores to seize property as allocated to them
through the securitized loan contracts.
To stave this off, the American taxpayers were coerced by former President
Bush and former
U.S. Treasury Secretary
Hank Paulson.
During that incident,
the U.S. Senate was told emphatically that they had to approve a $700 billion
bailout (below video) or else martial law would be implemented immediately.
That money was
funneled through the
Federal Reserve Bank and wired to China, as well as
other countries that were demanding repayment for the fraudulent
securitizations.
To further avert financial catastrophe, as well as more debt or property
seizure threats by the Chinese, the Euro was imploded there by plunging most
of the European countries into an insurmountable free-fall for which they
were never intended to recover.
All the money that those banks claimed they needed to avert collapse was
also sent to the Chinese to add to the trillions of dollars lost during the
burst of the housing bubble on the global market.
The only saving grace has been the U.S. dollar being the global reserve
currency.
However, now this prop is showing signs of wear
as foreign nations like China, Russia, India and Iran are dealing in gold as
currency and purchasing gold on the market at an exponential rate.
In 1970,
Henry Kissinger made a deal with the
Saudi Arabian government that American debt would be purchased in exchange
for cheap oil. Since then Iran has taken control over the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) by their use of gold as
currency which has threatened the direct value of the U.S. dollar as the
global reserve currency.
This scenario with Iran coupled with the massive leaps forward in U.S.
military presence on American streets and the emergence of FEMA camps across
the nation pose an obvious turn of events and explains exactly why we are
witnessing the silent implementation of martial law.
The war with Iran has to do with gold, its use as currency and its exposure
of the central banking cartels lack of gold which defines a fiat currencys
worth. And right now, the U.S. dollar is absolutely worthless.
The Deutsche Bank informant says that the financial collapse that happened
in 2008 will be realized here in America very soon. Once that happens, there
must be full implementation of marital law to control the potential riots
and control over citizens that will be desperate to feed their families.
The attacks of recent on
the 2nd Amendment play a significant role in
attempting amicably to remove the possibility of civilian retaliation
against the U.S. militarys presence throughout the nation.
However, if they cannot remove the guns from our
hands in time, they will continue on with the guidelines set out in Rex 84
with directives to kill any dissenters that refuse to obey.
