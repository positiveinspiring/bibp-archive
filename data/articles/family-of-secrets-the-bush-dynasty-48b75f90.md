What possible connection
could there have been
between George H.W. Bush and
the
assassination of John F. Kennedy?
Or between the C.I.A. and
the assassination?
Or between Bush and the
C.I.A.?
For some people, apparently,
making such connections was
as dangerous as letting one
live wire touch another.
Here, in anticipation of
the 50th anniversary of the
JFK assassination in November,
excerpts from,
Family of Secrets: The Bush
Dynasty, Americas Invisible Government
and the Hidden History of the Last
Fifty Years.
The story is a real-life
thriller.
