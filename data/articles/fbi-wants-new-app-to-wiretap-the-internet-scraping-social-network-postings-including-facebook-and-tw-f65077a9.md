The FBI's Strategic Information and Operations Center (SOIC) posted a
'Request for Information (RFI)' online last week seeking companies to build
a social network monitoring system for the FBI.
The
12-page document (.pdf)
spells out what the bureau wants from such a system and invites potential
contractors to reply by February 10, 2012.
It says the application should provide information about possible domestic
and global threats superimposed onto maps "using mash-up technology".
It says the application should collect "open source" information and have
the ability to:
-
Provide an automated search and scrape capability of social networks
including Facebook and Twitter.
-
Allow users to create new keyword searches.
-
Display different levels of threats as alerts on maps, possibly using color
coding to distinguish priority. Google Maps 3D and Yahoo Maps are listed
among the "preferred" mapping options.
-
Plot a wide range of domestic and global terror data.
-
Immediately translate foreign language tweets into English.
It notes that agents need to,
"locate bad actors... and analyze their
movements, vulnerabilities, limitations, and possible adverse actions".
It
also states that the bureau will use social media to create "pattern-of-life
matrices" - presumably logs of targets' daily routines - that will aid law
enforcement in planning operations.
New Scientist magazine
reports today:
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has quietly released
details of plans to continuously monitor the global output of
Facebook,
Twitter and other social networks, offering a rare glimpse into an activity
that the FBI and other government agencies are reluctant to discuss
publicly.
The plans show that the bureau believes it can use information
pulled from social media sites to better respond to crises, and maybe even
to foresee them. [...]
The use of the term "publicly available" suggests that Facebook and Twitter
may be able to exempt themselves from the monitoring by making their posts
private. But the desire of the US government to watch everyone may still
have an unwelcome impact, warns
Jennifer Lynch at the
Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a San Francisco-based advocacy group.
Lynch says that many people post to social media in the expectation that
only their friends and followers are reading, which gives them "the sense of
freedom to say what they want without worrying too much about recourse,"
says Lynch.
"But these tools that mine open source data and presumably store
it for a very long time, do away with that kind of privacy. I worry about
the effect of that on free speech in the US".

The BBC
reports:
The FBI issued the request three weeks
after the US Department of Homeland Security released a separate report into
the privacy implications of monitoring social media websites.
It justified the principle of using information that users have provided and
not opted to make private.
"Information posted to social media websites is publicly accessible and
voluntarily generated. Thus the opportunity not to provide information
exists prior to the informational post by the user," it says.[...]
The London-based campaign group,
Privacy International, said it was worried
about the consequences of such activities.
"Social networks are about connecting people with other people - if one
person is the target of police monitoring, there will be a dragnet effect in
which dozens, even hundreds, of innocent users also come under
surveillance," said Gus Hosein, the group's executive director.
"It is not necessarily the case that the more information law enforcement
officers have, the safer we will be.
"Police may well find themselves overwhelmed by a flood of personal
information, information that is precious to those it concerns but useless
for the purposes of crime prevention."

The Fierce Government website
reports on 'refining raw social media into
intelligence gold':
The notion that the future can be predicted by trends expressed in
collective social media output is one that has gained increased currency in
academic writing.
A
January analysis (.pdf) published by the Rand Corp. of
tweets using the
#IranElection hashtag during 2009 and early 2010 found a
correlation between appearance of swear words and protests.
The study also
found a shift that indicated the protest movement was losing momentum when
swearing shifted from curses at the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to
curses at an opposition figure.
A March 2011 paper published in the
Journal of Computational Science
(Twitter
Mood Predicts The Stock Market) also posited that movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
could be predicted to an accuracy of 86.7 percent by changes of national
mood reflected in Tweets.
According to The Economist, British hedge fund Derwent Capital Markets has licensed the algorithm to guide the investments
of a $41 million fund.
