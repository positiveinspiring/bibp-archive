Weapon"

In Malthusian terms,
the food supply is used by
governmental bodies
to limit and control the population
After recently watching the documentary
"King Corn" by filmmakers
Ian Cheney and Curtis Ellis, the state of the
nations, and in turn the worlds food supply was on my mind.
Why has
industrial corn - used for derivative food ingredients and now comprised almost wholly
of
genetically modified varieties
- become such a huge part of our
lives?
Apparently much of the reason for the rise of
corn is tied with Big Agra business and a
Secretary of Agriculture named
Earl Butz, who was appointed to office under
President Nixon and kept under President Ford.
In doing some basic research
on Butz, I encountered not only his scandals over racial remarks or his
mocking of the Pope for not backing overt population control, but the
file stubs of LaRouche PAC,
who heavily covered his involvement in Ford Administration affairs and his
controversial role at the key
1974 United Nations World Food Conference, which set up the World Food
Council (suspended in 1993), derived from a
Rockefeller proposal for a World Food Bank.
Just weeks before
Nelson Rockefeller would be
appointed Vice President of the United
States,
the Rockefeller machine had been
threatening administration officials held over from the Nixon
Administration
to go along with the agenda, including that of a world food authority.
One
of those figures was Earl Butz, who according to LaRouche press releases at
the time, was
targeted in the New York Times and pressured by attacks from ranking
political figures including
Nixons opponent and Democratic presidential candidaten
George McGover.
The result, reported below in a vintage LaRouche
publication, details how Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz "capitulated" to
these demands during his role at the November 1974 UN World Food Conference
in Rome, reversing his position, and backing the "Malthusian" eugenics views
on controlling the world food supply in conjunction with efforts to limit
the population.
According to
LaRouche:
Butz, who officially heads the U.S.
delegation, call for the establishment of a new "world food agency"
along the same lines proposed by the UNs Food and Agricutlure
Organization (FAO).
The Rockefeller Foundation-authored FAO proposal
would establish a supranational agency allowing the Rockefeller cabal
fingertip control over world food supplies.

This remains highly significant, as Butz
remained through the Ford Administration and frequently consulted with the
President and National Security Advisor and Secretary of State
Henry
Kissinger on food aid policy, food prices and production, among other
matters.
Significantly, just one month after the pivotal
1974 United Nations World Food Conference, Henry Kissinger officially issued
the National Security Council document "National
Security Study Memorandum 200 - Implications of Worldwide Population Growth
for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests" (NSSM 200 for short).
This document, which was also heavily analyzed
by
LaRouche PAC, called for
using "food as a weapon" to
aid in Third World depopulation efforts.
The document specifically
identified 13 key countries for depopulation
as a top priority under national security interests. One part of the
proposal discusses withholding food aid to induce population reduction and
family planning on the basis of food shortages.
Kissinger states,
"It is questionable whether
aid donor countries will be prepared to provide the sort of massive food aid
called for by the import projections on a long-term continuing basis,"
suggesting that Western nations might opt out of giving rations to countries
that have not followed international programs to cut population numbers.
According to Kissingers National Security
Council,
"Mandatory programs may be needed and we
should be considering these possibilities now," adding in NSSM 200, "Would
food be considered an instrument of national power?
Is the
U.S. prepared to accept food rationing
to help people who cant/wont control
their population growth?"
The veiled threat is clear as Kissinger, a top
Rockefeller envoy places a high priority on reducing population, is
directing U.S. foreign policy, in the name of national security, to
essentially blackmail countries into compliance with "family planning"
programs to implement contraceptives, sterilizations and abortions to reduce
the birthrate with the leverage of food supply and food aid.
"There is also some established precedent
for taking account of family planning performance in appraisal of
assistance requirements by AID [U.S. Agency for International
Development] and consultative groups.
Since population growth is a major
determinant of increases in food demand,
allocation of scarce
PL 480 resources
should take account of what steps a country is taking in population
control as well as food production.
In these sensitive relations, however, it is
important in style as well as substance to
avoid the
appearance of coercion."
