"The powers of financial capitalism had a
far-reaching plan, nothing less than to create a world system of
financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system
of each country and the economy of the world as a whole...
Their secret
is that they have annexed from governments, monarchies, and republics
the power to create the world's money..."
THE MONEY MASTERS is a 3Â½ hour
non-fiction, historical documentary that traces the origins of the political
power structure that rules our nation and the world today.
The modern
political power structure has its roots in the hidden manipulation and
accumulation of gold and other forms of money.
The development of fractional reserve banking
practices in the 17th century brought to a cunning sophistication the secret
techniques initially used by goldsmiths fraudulently to accumulate wealth.
With the formation of the privately-owned Bank of England in 1694, the yoke
of economic slavery to a privately-owned "central" bank was first forced
upon the backs of an entire nation, not removed but only made heavier with
the passing of the three centuries to our day.
Nation after nation, including America, has
fallen prey to this cabal of international central bankers.
