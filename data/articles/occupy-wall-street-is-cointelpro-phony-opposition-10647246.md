COINTELPRO was the FBI acronym for 'Counter
Intelligence Program'.
COINTELPRO not only infiltrated domestic antiwar
and civil rights protest groups, it also created them. By 1968, the largest
leading 'counterculture' groups were entirely FBI/CIA controlled.
In fact the leading 'Anti-Establishment' figures of the late 60's early 70's
were ousted years later as having been double agents for
the CIA.
LSD promoter Harvard Dr. Timothy Leary, feminist
icon and co-founder editor of MS Magazine, Gloria Steinem - who persists
today as an icon of feminism.

COINTELPRO never went away, it got privatized.
ORGANIZED BY A SERBIAN
OUTFIT
OCCUPY WALL STREET and the OCCUPY TOGETHER MOVEMENT is the work of SERBIAN
contract revolution organizers the "Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and
Strategies" (CANVAS) in Belgrade and it's field operative organizer
company, "OTPOR!"
So don't you believe it when ABC says "Everybody and nobody are in
charge..." or the Guardian hints, "rumors persist the group 'Anonymous' is
behind the Occupy Together Movement".
The cover story is that back in 1998 some
college students at the University of Belgrade that were unhappy with
totalitarian regime of Slobodan Miloević decided it would be fun to topple
the Serbian government.
The smartest guy in the room, Ivan Marovic,
allegedly dreamed up a grass roots strategy and they went to work organizing
protests as OPTOR! which means RESISTANCE! in English.
The group was helped by the fact that the U.S. and NATO started bombing the
heck out of Serbia in 1999 accelerated the fall of Slobodan Miloević (below) by 2000.
Western media hailed Marovic and OTPOR! as new age geniuses,
but it came out later that Ivan Marovic's strategy and program came from a
Boston think tank's subversion manual, 'From Dictatorship to Democracy' by a
Harvard Professor named Gene Sharp.
Hundreds of copies of the Boston manual were provided in the Serbian
language by the Albert Einstein Institution,
"a non-profit organization
that specializes in the study of the methods of non-violent resistance in
conflicts".
A documentary on Professor Sharp's global
influence on the revolutions export, "How to Start a Revolution"
(below video) was
released in September 2011.
It won awards at the Boston Film Festival and
London's Raindance Film Festival on October 2nd 2011.
Basking in media hype that OTPOR! had toppled
the big bad Serbian regime, Ivan Marovic and his band of merry pranksters
founded the CENTER FOR APPLIED NONVIOLENT ACTION AND STRATEGIES [C.A.N.V.A.S.]
It occupies an office building in downtown
Belgrade, which plans revolutions and trains organizers in subversive
strategy and tactics for money. The Belgrade office is nicknamed 'Revolution
University'.
PEELING THE ONION
That's the story currently on the Internet, but it omits
the same operation in the color and flower revolutions dating back to
Czechoslovakia 1989: The VELVET Revolution (Radio Prague history online).
Word on the street in Prague was that there was KGB involvement getting it
started, and we know there was CIA support and Western funding as well.
That
may be a meaningful case in itself, and the history of these 'people's
revolutions' mustn't be allowed to fall through the cracks of mainstream
media. OTPOR's being portrayed as the genesis of 'people power' but it was
the baby on the block in 1998.
The news today is scripted for an audience
born after 1987, evidently.
C.A.N.V.A.S. even markets a computer game that teaches all ages how to start
your own revolution called "People Power". Marovic said candidly in a
documentary interview that the game was funded by one of the original
backers of Otpor! A previous version of the game was called 'A Force More
Powerful'.
Marovic said he can personally train only 150 subversives a year, the game
reaches tens of thousand at a price of ten dollars a download. I've reviewed
the game and attest it's a highly detailed simulation of how these export
revolutions are organized, complete with 'establishment' reactions.
The so-called 'spontaneous' 'Twitter' Revolutions in the Middle East in
February. Who do you think is organizing the unemployed, uneducated, angry
Middle East youth who are the brown shirts of these revolutions?
The
Carnegie Foundation says the most wonderful things about them.
They all have the
same fist logo.
Let's be honest. C.A.N.V.A.S. is a for-profit business, not a non-profit
NGO.
"Ivan Marovic" is a CIA contractor: a front man like 'Wikileaks' Julian
Assange.
OCCUPY WALL STREET
(the phony feminist fist)
What's all this got to do with OCCUPY WALL STREET and the the OCCUPY
TOGETHER 'grass roots' movement in America?
Take a minute to watch this. You'll figure out.

The Revolution Business
NOT ALL PROTESTS ARE
FAKE
COINTELPRO fake protests partner with MEDIA to distract from real protests.
I believe the Greek protest is genuine. OCCUPY WALL STREET was timed to
drown out the Greeks.
I think this because the Greeks had a specific demand last month in direct
response to their government's sellout to the IMF.
The Greek protest was
saying,
'Don't vote to accept this debt, traitors!'
The "Occupy Wall Street"
type protest is NON SPECIFIC.
CONINTELPRO handled protests don't make demands - they make 'statements'.
Like, "STOP WAR! LEGALIZE POT! "Give us back our future!" and "Stop
pollution!"
OCCUPY TOGETHER in the US and Canada are directed by
C.A.N.V.AS., the same
directors behind the Tunisian and Egyptian and 'Arab Spring' revolutions.
They may look the same but the objectives are quite different. The objective
in America and Canada is NOT to topple 'regimes'.
C.A.N.V.AS. is backed by
Council on Foreign Relations foundations like Carnegie Group and the Albert
Einstein Institute and myriad other funnels of Illuminati funding.
This is yet another orchestrated international 'controlled opposition'
mouse trap. the 'Tea Party' is the controlled opposition trap for the conservative, this is the controlled opposition trap for the naive lefties.
Remember the
Venus Project?
