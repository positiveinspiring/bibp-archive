Area 51/Groom Lake (USAF/DOE/CIA) Base
and S-4 (Papoose Lake Base)
Ultra-secure "non-existent" deployment bases where extremely classified
aerospace vehicles are tested and operational flown, including the Aurora
hypersonic spyplane, the Black Manta [TR-3A] stealth fighter follow-on to
the F-117A, the Pumpkinseed hyper-speed unmanned aerospace reconnaissance
vehicle, and several variants of anti-gravitational craft (U.S.-UFOs).
We all know that quotation marks around a term means just the opposite of
what it purports so we know that these bases do exist. Are we to support
with U.S. taxes spyplanes which encourage a kind of Cold War? I believe that
you would concur that we should not.
