The U.S. government wants to know where your
greenhouse is.
Under
Senate Bill 510 - which is now back in the hands of the
U.S. Senate after the House hid an amendment in an appropriations bill and
passed it last night - American food producers would be required to register
their facilities with the U.S. government.
The feds, it seems, want a database of food
growers so they know who to target for surprise inspections (show me your
papers!).
As stated in the bill itself:
SEC. 102. REGISTRATION OF FOOD FACILITIES.
18 (a) UPDATING OF FOOD CATEGORY
REGULATIONS; BIENNIAL REGISTRATION RENEWAL.
Section 415(a) (2120 U.S.C. 350d(a))
"The registration shall contain an assurance that the Secretary will be
permitted to inspect such facility at the times and in the manner
permitted by this Act."

What this language shows is that the point of
registration is so that government agents can conduct surprise inspections
of food facilities.
At least 4,000 new
FDA agents will need to be hired if this
bill becomes law, greatly expanding the FDA's agent presence in much the
same way the TSA expanded over the last few years.
Kangaroo courts for
violators
Once an FDA inspection occurs, if the government believes the food grower is
producing anything that might pose a risk to the public (and note carefully
that "belief" is the only thing required, not actual scientific evidence of
harm), that food grower is then "suspended" from producing food.
After that, they get dragged into a kangaroo FDA court where a panel of FDA
officials then decides their fate. This takes place with no due process, no
attorney, no Constitutional protections and no rights whatsoever.
This is,
in every sense, a "King's court" where the King can simply decide that
you're guilty and put you out of business.
Here's the language in the S.510 legislation:
"(2) HEARING ON SUSPENSION.
- The Secretary shall provide the registrant
subject to an order under paragraph (1) with an opportunity for an
informal hearing, to be held as soon as possible but not later than 2
business days after the issuance of the order or such other time period,
as agreed upon by the Secretary and the registrant, on the actions
required for reinstatement of registration and why the registration that
is subject to suspension should be reinstated.
The Secretary shall reinstate a registration
if the Secretary determines, based on evidence presented, that adequate
grounds do not exist to continue the suspension of the registration."
Did you read this carefully? It means the
Secretary (a bureaucrat) gets to decide who can grow food and who can't.
This is the FDA's kangaroo court, much like the FTC's kangaroo court that's
currently being used to destroy companies offering nutritional supplements
and natural cancer cures.
Remember, too, the bill abandoned actual science and now relies entirely on
the FDA's "belief" to determine which foods to recall:
SEC. 208. ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION OF FOOD.
23 (a) IN GENERAL. - Section 304(h)(1)(A) (21 U.S.C.24 334(h)(1)(A)) is
amended by
(1) striking ''credible evidence or information indicating'' and
inserting ''reason to believe''
FDA tyranny is on the rise
So essentially what we have here is a food tyranny bill that would hand a
group of un-elected bureaucrats who answer to no one the power to control
virtually the entire U.S. food supply.
This is an agency, by the way, that is already
responsible for
the deaths of millions of Americans. This
is an agency that has participated in
armed raids against natural product
companies.
To all those who say,
"S. 510 is no big deal, the FDA won't abuse
its power, this is just about safety"
...I say you have no grasp of the history of
tyranny.
The FDA has virtually never taken action to
protect the People. Its actions have consistently been shaped to maximize
the profits of the powerful corporations even at the expense of human lives.
Just read the
history of Vioxx if you need a refresher on
that point.
That the U.S. Congress would now seek to hand over control of our food
supply to this dangerous, rogue government agency is an obscene betrayal of
the American people. This is precisely why we must stand up and fight S.510
once again to defeat it in the Senate where it is now schedule for yet
another vote. (Like a bad case of herpes, this bill just won't die, it
seems...)

Once again, CALL your representatives in the House and the Senate. You can
reach the Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask for your
representatives by name.
By the way, just for the record, I am appalled at the lack of action on this
item by some so-called "health freedom" organizations which appear to be
doing absolutely nothing to rally opposition to this bill. A few groups are
fighting hard to oppose it (NaturalNews, ANH-USA.com, Natural Solutions
Foundation, etc.) but there are several which appear to be sitting on the
sidelines, doing nothing. I'm not sure why.
This is precisely the kind of issue that should
have the entire health freedom community up in arms to protect our food
freedoms.
Robert Scott Bell gets it, by the way. So do the Vitamin Lawyer (Ralph Fucetola) and health freedom attorneys like
James Turner and Jonathan Emord.
All the freedom-oriented people seem to understand how crucial this is to
maintain our food freedoms and keep the FDA out of our farms as much as
possible.
If you think the FDA is bad now, just wait until
they are granted yet more powers (and funding) to unleash an army of
thousands of new agents who sweep across America, raiding small family farms
(no, they're not all exempted from this bill) and imprisoning raw milk
producers.
The FDA is about to become the SS of food fascism. This is not an
exaggeration.
Who would have thought, five years ago, that the
TSA would be reaching down your pants and feeling your genitals? Just
imagine now what the FDA will do with similar powers over your food and
farms. Crudely put, the TSA may be feeling your junk, but the FDA will have
us all by the balls.
Take action now to protect your food freedoms (or you will forever lose
them).
