NEWS THAT A 49 YEAR-OLD DYNCORP security team
leader died in company housing from a drug overdose in Kabul on March 19
affirmed multiple reports that dirty dealings continue in Afghanistan by
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sponsored front companies.
Although his name is being withheld until an investigation is completed,
Ellen Nakashima of the Washington Post revealed on April 18 that this,
employee procured drugs on monthly trips to
Thailand, and that his superiors were aware of his conduct and failed to
take action. She also stated that the company ignored signs of drug
abuse among employees.
This wasnt an isolated case.
On April 17, Matthew Lee of the
Associated Press reported that,
four other employees have tested positive
for drugs when the company conducted tests after the mans death.
Considering that 80 percent of the worlds
heroin originates from Afghanistan, and that
DynCorp is the State Departments largest
contractor, it is no surprise that allegations have surfaced over the years
that DynCorp is clandestinely involved in illegal black market operations.
BAIT AND SWITCH
At play here is a classic example of bait and switch.
On the one hand, according to Declan Walsh
of The Guardian on Aug. 16, 2008, two years ago,
the U.S. spent $88 million on an
eradication program run by DynCorp, a company that employs many retired
American Special Forces soldiers.
So, while giving the appearance of being
antidrug, what the CIA in reality has done is privatize its illegal
activities.
In a lengthy article entitled
Dirty Tricks, Inc.: The DynCorp Government Connection,
Uri Dowbenko provides an excellent overview of how this symbiotic
relationship works.
Using private companies for government work
has been long exploited by the CIA and Pentagon, who like to use
proxies, such as contractors or mercenaries to fight their covert wars.
The benefits for federal agencies include
plausible deniability with respect to assassinations and drug
trafficking, as well as the ability to bypass the Military Code of
Honor and accords of the Geneva Convention. In other words,
by privatizing dirty tricks, a federal agency cannot be held liable.
LONG HISTORY OF DRUG
RUNNING
Ninety-five percent of DynCorps revenues are generated from the U.S.
government. In its employ, DynCorp recycles ex-military veterans, retired
intelligence agents, and those involved in previous scandals.
For example, Associated Press reporter
Ken Guggenheim disclosed on June 5, 2001 that a DynCorp subcontractor,
Eagle Aviation Service and Technology (EAST),
helped Oliver North run guns to Nicaraguan
rebels in what would be known as the IranContra affair.
Planes delivering weapons to Central America
returned to the U.S. filled with drugs. (See
Hillary (and Bill): The Drugs Volume)
Further evidence linking DynCorp to the narcotics trade can be found in
articles by The Nations Jason Vest (DynCorps
Drug Problem), and Robert Lawsons
DynCorp: Beyond the Rule of Law,
wherein he describes how contract employees were caught smuggling heroin out
of Colombia within the last decade.
EVEN MORE ILLEGAL
ACTIVITIES
The most recent death of a DynCorp smuggler wasnt the first.
In 2000, 29 year-old Michael Demons died
of cardiac arrest after overdosing on cocaine in Florencia, Colombia. Robert
Lawson reproduced a quote from a high-ranking police officer given to
Semana magazine about DynCorps apparent immunity from prosecution.
No authority, whether the Civil Aviation
Authority, police or army, is authorized to search DynCorps planes.
Nobody knows what they carry on their return to the United States
because they are untouchable.
He concludes,
Washington is sitting pretty. It may
secretly approve of and encourage counterinsurgency operations conducted
by DynCorp, but it doesnt have to take responsibility for them.
DynCorp has escaped penalty for decades because,
as Rachael Guevera of The Progressive noted in October, 2002,
Many DynCorp executives are former CIA or
military personnel, [while] others were formerly of Enron or
Citigroup.
In addition, their mercenaries were past
antiCastro contract personnel or members of the Iran-Contra Secret Team.
Serious allegations have been levied over the years regarding DynCorps
involvement in the transport of prostitutes, plus the human trafficking of
children and young women in Bosnia.
These claims were serious enough for Rep.
Cynthia McKinney (DGa) to question Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
in March, 2005; whereas whistleblower Kathryn Bolkovac was fired for
her knowledge of the Bosnian sex trade.
In a lawsuit against DynCorp, former employee Ben Johnston alleged
that the federal contractor,
engaged in slavery, sexually exploiting
children, dealing in obscene material, and procuring fraudulent
identification documents for underage victims.
So why is DynCorp still receiving billions
in government contracts without serious congressional investigations?
Without any action, its clear that DynCorp will
keep sheep-dipping their operatives by providing new cover, while engaging
in their old tried-and-true blackop practices.
