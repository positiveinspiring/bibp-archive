World leaders and activists from around the world gathered for the
G20
Summit.
With over 19,000 police officers and security personnel on hand, the results
lead to over 1,100 arrests, martial law in downtown Toronto, and the most
massive violation of civil liberties in Canadian history.
Here is one interesting comment from YT:
So they spend a billion(?) dollars to
protect 20 guys. These 20 dudes could have stayed home and used Skype or
something. Meanwhile they discuss how theyre going to take money away
from the ordinary people to keep
the system running.
