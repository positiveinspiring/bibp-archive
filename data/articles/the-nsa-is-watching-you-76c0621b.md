Three targeted Americans:
None of these U.S. citizens was charged with a
crime, but they have been tracked, surveilled, detained - sometimes at
gunpoint - and interrogated, with no access to a lawyer.
Each remains
resolute in standing up to the increasing government crackdown on dissent.
The intelligence official
William Binney worked for almost 40 years at the
secretive National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. spy agency that dwarfs
the CIA.
As technical director of the NSAs World
Geopolitical and Military Analysis Reporting Group, Binney told me, he was
tasked to,
see how we could solve collection, analysis
and reporting on military and geopolitical issues all around the world,
every country in the world.
Throughout the 1990s, the NSA developed a
massive eavesdropping system code-named
ThinThread, which, Binney says,
maintained crucial protections on the privacy of U.S. citizens demanded by
the U.S. Constitution.
He recalled,
After 9/11, all the wraps came off for NSA, as massive domestic spying became the norm. He resigned on Oct. 31,
2001.
Along with several other NSA officials, Binney reported his concerns to
Congress and to the Department of Defense.
Then, in 2007, as then-Attorney
General Alberto Gonzales was being questioned on Capitol Hill about the very
domestic spying to which Binney objected, a dozen FBI agents charged into
his house, guns drawn.
They forced aside his son and found Binney, a
diabetic amputee, in the shower. They pointed their guns at his head, then
led him to his back porch and interrogated him.
Three others were raided that morning.
Binney called the FBI raid,
retribution and intimidation so we didnt
go to the Judiciary Committee in the Senate and tell them, Well, heres
what Gonzales didnt tell you, OK.
Binney was never charged with any crime.
The filmmaker
Laura Poitras is an Academy Award-nominated documentary
filmmaker, whose recent films include My Country, My Country, about the
U.S. occupation of Iraq, and The Oath, which was filmed in Yemen.
Since
2006, Poitras has been detained and questioned at airports at least 40
times.
She has had her computer and reporters
notebooks confiscated and presumably copied, without a warrant. The most
recent time, April 5, she took notes during her detention. The agents told
her to stop, as they considered her pen a weapon.
She told me:
I feel like I cant talk about the work
that I do in my home, in my place of work, on my telephone, and
sometimes in my country. So the chilling effect is huge. Its enormous.
The hacker
Jacob Appelbaum works as a computer
security researcher for the nonprofit organization the Tor Project (torproject.org),
which is a free software package that allows people to browse the Internet
anonymously, evading government surveillance.
Tor was actually created by the U.S. Navy, and
is now developed and maintained by Appelbaum and his colleagues. Tor is used
by dissidents around the world to communicate over the Internet. Tor also
serves as the main way that
the controversial WikiLeaks website protects
those who release documents to it.
Appelbaum has volunteered for WikiLeaks,
leading to intense U.S. government surveillance.
Appelbaum spoke in place of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, at a
conference called Hackers on Planet Earth, or
HOPE, as people feared Assange
would be arrested.
He started his talk by saying:
Hello to all my friends and fans in
domestic and international surveillance. Im here today because I
believe that we can make a better world.
He has been detained at least a dozen times at
airports:
I was put into a special room, where they
frisked me, put me up against the wall... Another one held my wrists...
They implied that if I didnt make a deal with them, that Id be
sexually assaulted in prison...
They took my cellphones, they took my
laptop. They wanted, essentially, to ask me questions about the Iraq
War, the Afghan War, what I thought politically.
I asked Binney if he believed the NSA has copies
of every email sent in the U.S.
He replied,
I believe they have most of them, yes.
Binney said two senators, Ron Wyden and
Mark
Udall, have expressed concern, but have not spoken out, as, Binney says,
they would lose their seats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
Meanwhile, Congress is set to vote on the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and
Protection Act, or
CISPA. Proponents of Internet freedom are fighting the
bill, which they say will legalize what the NSA is secretly doing already.
Members of Congress, fond of quoting the countrys founders, should recall
these words of Benjamin Franklin before voting on CISPA:
They who can give up essential liberty to
obtain a little temporary safety,
deserve neither liberty nor safety.
