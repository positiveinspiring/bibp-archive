The future
of world politics will be about which
societies can develop responsive
institutions to govern vast geographical
space and which cannot.
Will the
growing trend of protests and civil
unrest around the world - as
demonstrated in the Middle East,
Thailand and Ukraine recently - soon
spread to countries like Russia and
China?
Where will the
present season of 'anarchy' lead?
Twenty years ago, in February 1994, I published
a lengthy cover story in The Atlantic Monthly, "The
Coming Anarchy - How Scarcity, Crime, Overpopulation, Tribalism,
and Disease are Rapidly Destroying the Social Fabric of Our Planet."
I argued that the combination of resource
depletion (like water), demographic youth bulges and the proliferation of
shanty towns throughout the developing world would enflame ethnic and
sectarian divides, creating the conditions for domestic political breakdown
and the transformation of war into increasingly irregular forms - making it
often indistinguishable from terrorism.
I wrote about the erosion of national borders
and the rise of the environment as the principal security issues of the 21st
century. I accurately predicted the collapse of certain African states in
the late 1990s and the rise
of political Islam in Turkey and other places.
Islam, I wrote, was a religion ideally suited
for the badly urbanized poor who were willing to fight. I also got
things wrong, such as the probable intensification of racial divisions in
the United States; in fact, such divisions have been impressively
ameliorated.
However, what is not in dispute is that
significant portions of the earth, rather than follow the dictates of
Progress and Rationalism, are simply harder and harder to govern, even as
there is insufficient evidence of an emerging and widespread civil society.
Civil society in significant swaths of the earth
is still the province of a relatively elite few in capital cities - the very
people Western journalists feel most comfortable befriending and
interviewing, so that the size and influence of such a class is exaggerated
by the media.
The 'anarchy' unleashed in the Arab world, in
particular, has other roots, though - roots not adequately dealt with in my
original article:
The End of Imperialism.
That's right. Imperialism provided much of
Africa, Asia and Latin America with security and administrative order. The
Europeans divided the planet into a gridwork of entities - both artificial
and not - and governed.
It may not have been fair, and it may not have
been altogether civil, but it provided order. Imperialism, the mainstay of
stability for human populations for thousands of years, is now gone.
The End of Post-Colonial Strongmen
Colonialism did not end completely with the
departure of European colonialists.
It continued for decades in the guise
of strong dictators, who had inherited state systems from the
colonialists. Because these strongmen often saw themselves as
anti-Western freedom fighters, they believed that they now had the moral
justification to govern as they pleased.
The Europeans had not been democratic in
the
Middle East, and neither was this new class of rulers.
Hafez al Assad, Saddam Hussein, Ali Abdullah
Saleh, Moammar Gadhafi and the Nasserite pharaohs in Egypt right up through
Hosni Mubarak all belonged to this category, which, like that of the
imperialists, has been quickly retreating from the scene (despite a comeback
in Egypt).
No Institutions
Here we come to the key element.
The post-colonial Arab dictators ran moukhabarat states:
states whose order depended on the secret police and the other, related
security services.
But beyond that, institutional
and bureaucratic development was weak and unresponsive to the needs of
the population - a population that, because it was increasingly urbanized,
required social services and complex infrastructure.
(Alas, urban societies are more demanding on
central governments than agricultural ones, and the world is rapidly
urbanizing.)
It is institutions that fill the gap between the
ruler at the top and the extended family or tribe at the bottom. Thus, with
insufficient institutional development, the chances for either
dictatorship or anarchy proliferate.
Civil society occupies the middle ground between
those extremes, but it cannot prosper without the requisite institutions and
bureaucracies.
Feeble Identities
With feeble institutions, such post-colonial
states have feeble identities.
If the state only means oppression, then its
population consists of subjects, not citizens. Subjects of despotisms know
only fear, not loyalty. If the state has only fear to offer, then, if the
pillars of the dictatorship crumble or are brought low, it is non-state
identities that fill the subsequent void.
And in a state configured by long-standing legal
borders, however artificially drawn they may have been, the triumph of
non-state identities can mean 'anarchy.'
Doctrinal Battles
Religion occupies a place in daily life in the
Islamic world that the West has not known since the days - a millennium ago
- when the West was called "Christendom."
Thus, non-state identity in the 21st-century
Middle East generally means religious identity. And because there are
variations of belief even within a great world religion like Islam, the rise
of religious identity and the consequent decline of state identity means the
inflammation of doctrinal disputes, which can take on an irregular, military
form.
In the early medieval era, the Byzantine Empire
- whose whole identity was infused
with Christianity - had violent,
doctrinal disputes between iconoclasts (those opposed to graven images like
icons) and iconodules (those who venerated them).
As the Roman Empire collapsed and Christianity
rose as a replacement identity, the upshot was not tranquility but violent,
doctrinal disputes between Donatists, Monotheletes and other Christian sects
and heresies.
So, too, in the Muslim world today, as state
identities weaken and sectarian and other differences within Islam come to
the fore, often violently.
Information Technology
Various forms of electronic communication, often
transmitted by Smartphones, can empower the crowd against a hated regime, as
protesters who do not know each other personally can find each other
through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.
But while such technology can help topple
governments, it cannot provide a coherent and organized replacement pole of
bureaucratic power to maintain political stability afterwards.
This is how technology encourages 'anarchy.'
The
Industrial Age was about bigness: big tanks, aircraft carriers, railway
networks and so forth, which magnified the power of big centralized states.
But the post-industrial age is about smallness, which can empower small and
oppressed groups, allowing them to challenge
the state - with
'anarchy'
sometimes the result.
Because we are talking here about long-term
processes rather than specific events, 'anarchy' in one form or another will
be with us for some time, until new political formations arise that provide
for the requisite order. And these new political formations need not be
necessarily democratic.
When the Soviet Union collapsed, societies in
Central and Eastern Europe that had sizable middle classes and reasonable
bureaucratic traditions prior to World War II were able to transform
themselves into relatively stable democracies.
But the Middle East and much
of Africa lack such bourgeoisie traditions, and so the fall of strongmen has
left a void.
West African countries that fell into 'anarchy' in
the late 1990s - a few years after my article was published - like Sierra
Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast, still have not really recovered, but are
wards of the international community through foreign 'peacekeeping forces' or
'advisers,' even as they struggle to develop a middle class and a
manufacturing base.
For, the development of efficient and responsive
bureaucracies requires literate functionaries, which, in turn, requires a
middle class.
The real question marks are Russia and China.
The possible weakening of authoritarian rule in those sprawling states may
usher in less democracy than chronic instability and ethnic separatism that
would dwarf in scale the current instability in the Middle East.
Indeed, what follows Vladimir Putin could be
worse, not better. The same holds true for a weakening of autocracy in
China. The future of world politics will be about which societies can
develop responsive institutions to govern vast geographical space and which
cannot.
That is the question toward which the present
season of 'anarchy' leads.
