Beginning in North Africa, now unfolding in the Middle East and Iran, and
soon to spread to Eastern Europe and Asia, the globalist fueled color
revolutions are attempting to profoundly transform entire regions of the
planet in one sweeping move.
It is an ambitious gambit, perhaps even one born
of desperation, with the globalists' depravity and betrayal on full display
to the world with no opportunity to turn back now.
To understand the globalists' reasoning behind such a bold move, it helps to
understand their ultimate end game and the obstacles standing between them
and their achieving it.
The End Game
The End
Game of course is a world spanning system of global governance.
This is a system controlled by Anglo-American
financiers and their network of global institutions ensuring the world's
consolidated nations conform to a singular system they can then perpetually
fleece. As megalomaniacal oligarchs, their singular obsession is the
consolidation and preservation of their power. This will be achieved through
a system of population control, industrial control, and monetary control,
which together form the foundation of their Malthusian policies.
These policies are on full display in the UN's "Agenda 21," and by policy
wonks like the current White House Science Adviser John Holdren in his book
titled "Ecoscience"
(very large pdf file).
Malthusian as their policies may be, they surely do not believe the world is
in danger due to over-population or the environmental hazards posed by
industrial progress.
Instead, like all tyrants in history, they are
establishing a convincing narrative to defend the immense concentration of
undue power within their elitist hands and the implementation of measures to
ensure such power stays in their hands indefinitely.
The immediate dangers posed to their plans are numerous, including an
alternative media increasingly exposing the true nature of their agenda, and
thus awakening a vast number of people who simply refuse to go along with
it. There is also national sovereignty, where nations are openly challenging
this Anglo-American centric world order and refusing to implement the
conditions of their own enslavement.
These sweeping color revolutions, and coordinated military operations, both
overt and covert, are dealing with the latter of these two challenges, while
censorship, cognitive infiltration, and a tightening police state spanning
the Western world under the very false premise of a "War on Terror"
confronts the former.
Red = US-backed destabilization, Blue = US occupying/stationed.
China's oil and seaways are all covered.
The Middle East
With the globalist fueled destabilization in progress, concessions and
regime changes are being made from Jordan to Egypt, all in the name of
"democratization."
The protesters' calls are verbatim repeats of the their
local US funded NGOs' mission statements. Skeptical as many may be that all
of this is being orchestrated by the West, one needs only read the RAND
Corporation's 2007 report titled "Building Moderate Muslim Networks" where
breathtaking confessions are made to not only reorder the Muslim world
according to the West's interests, but how they would follow the same model
of "civil society networks" they have already used for decades during the
Cold War.
Egypt's recent "transition" played out as a direct translation of RAND's
blueprint for meddling in the Muslim world. From the protest organizers and
NGOs to the protest leaders, to the
behind-the-scenes meddling by America's
military leadership, the Egyptian uprising was entirely a US production.
Even the drafting of the new Egyptian Constitution is being carried out by
organizations funded by
George Soros and the US National Endowment for
Democracy.
The regional destabilization is resetting the geopolitical board in favor
for a renewed effort to affect regime change in Iran. It has been
extensively covered that the globalists have intricate and extensive plans,
in the form of Brookings Institute's "Which Path to Persia?" report, to fund
color revolutions, support terrorism inside of the Islamic Republic and even
provoke war with a nation they concede would rather avoid conflict.
No
sooner did North African and Arab regimes begin to crumble did
the "Green
Revolution" in Iran start up again.
As if reiterating the summation of
Brookings' report, the globalist Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) has
recently and overtly called on
the US to back the "Green Revolution."
Iran's fall to the globalists, the extraction of its wealth, and the end of
its support for Chinese and Russian economic and military ambitions would
isolate the so-called
Shanghai Cooperative Organization further.
NATO creeping forward,
suffering failures in Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia.
Russia's Encirclement
Russia, along with China appear to be the two biggest blocs of opposition to
the Anglo-American establishment.
Indeed there are plenty of people and
organizations within each nation gladly working hand-in-hand with the
globalists, who in turn, are overtly trying to tempt and coerce the two
nations to integrate themselves into their global world order.
Men like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who rose to power in Russia amongst an era of
immense corruption,
began building networks of NGOs modeled directly after
those of the Anglo-Americans in the West, even naming this network the "Open
Russian Foundation" after George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
According
to geopolitical researcher William Engdahl, this Open Russian Foundation
included
Henry Kissinger and Lord
Jacob Rothschild on its board of directors
and
its goal was to transform Russia from a sovereign state and into
something more palatable for globalist consumption.
Whatever Khdorkovsky's early successes may have been, they were cut short by
Russian Prime Minister Vladamir Putin, who has safely confined Khodorkovsky
behind the bars of a Siberian prison. Today, Khdorkovsky receives lobbying
and legal services from
notorious globalist lawyer Robert Amsterdam who
leads international efforts to vilify Russia and justify the nation's
encirclement by NATO.
After Tunisia fell and protests began brewing in Egypt, Foreign Policy
magazine published the Freedom House's list of "Who's Next?" On the list was
Belarus' Aleksandr Lukashenko, leader of a European nation directly
bordering Russia's western border, staring Moscow in the face.
NATO itself
admits the reluctance of Belarus to join its now unjustified organization,
while the mainstream media
berates the Belarusian government for putting
down protests launched after the results of recent elections that saw the
Western-backed opposition defeated.
Looking at a map of Russia, not a nation touching its borders has been
spared the globalist treatment, from the Ukraine and their US-backed Orange
Revolution, to Georgia and its US-backed invasion of South Ossetia. For
Russia, they seem more than prepared to fight back, humiliating the
US-trained and equipped Georgian military on the battlefield and overseeing
the results of the
US-funded Orange Revolution overturned, with
Ukrainian
talks to join NATO halted.
By targeting the Middle East, and in particular Iran, which both China and
Russia have been using to check the West's world domineering ambitions, the
globalists' hope is to renew political unrest in Russia's satellite regions
and complete its campaign of encircling Russia, thus forcing it to concede
to its place amongst the new global order.
SSI's "String of Pearls:"
China's oil lifeline.
China's String of
Pearls
It is no secret China depends on oil imports to not only keep its economy
growing, but to keep its vast population busy and prosperous, thus keeping
the ruling government in power.
This has been a long known realism by both
China and the West. For China's part, they have begun building a presence on
continental Africa,
especially in Sudan where they have established a 1,000
mile oil pipeline from the vast nation's heartland to Port Sudan on the Red
Sea. They have also provided relief to the country from UN sanctions and
buys the majority of Sudan's oil exports.
China also imports an immense amount of oil from Iran. In fact, the Islamic
Republic represents the
world's second largest exporter of oil to China,
behind Saudi Arabia.
From Sudan and Iran, across the Indian Ocean, and back to China's shores in
the South China Sea, represents a "String of Pearls," or a series of
geopolitical assets China is developing to protect this vital logistical
route.
This "String" includes a Chinese port in Pakistan's Baluchistan
region, another facility in Myanmar (Burma), and expanded facilities in the
South China Sea off the coast of Vietnam. China is also building up the size
and capabilities of its fleet, including submarines which now shadow
America's carrier groups, and the outfitting of their first aircraft carrier
which is nearing completion.
The term "String of Pearls" was used as the title of the US Strategic
Studies Institute's (SSI) 2006 report "String of Pearls: Meeting the
challenge of Chinas rising power across the Asian littoral."
In this
report, China's ambitions to project its power along this route is viewed as
a direct challenge to American supremacy as well as a threat to the West's unipolar vision of a "new world order."
While China may not be a champion of human freedom, they do appear to favor
a multipolar world where sovereign nations coexist instead of the
Anglo-American unipolar world where, unsurprisingly, the British and
American oligarchs dominate the planet.
To prevent such a multipolar world from coming into existence, the SSI
report suggests several strategies regarding China, from engaging and
enticing it to become what globalist pusher Robert Zoellick calls a
"responsible stakeholder" in the "international system," to outright
military confrontation and containment.
Of course this report was written in July 2006, and the ink hadn't even
dried before Israel suffered a humiliating defeat in its war with Lebanon,
the war with Iran stalled, and globalist minion Thaksin Shinawtra was ousted
from power in Thailand in a display of jealously defended sovereignty in
Southeast Asia.
It appears that the globalists, over the following years, would present
China with a flattering role to play in their global order while
simultaneously destabilizing nearly every nation along the "String of
Pearls." The US has expanded its war in Afghanistan and is attempting to
balkanize Pakistan in the process, specifically
the Baluchistan region where
China is establishing a naval presence.
Pakistan's Baluchistan region is
also the seaside starting point of an energy and logistical conduit running
northward through the Himalayas and into Chinese territory.
The US is also
heavily involved in destabilizing Myanmar (Burma) to affect regime change
and subsequently establishing a Washington dependent government.
Thailand neighbors Myanmar to the east and possesses the narrow
Kra Isthmus
China would like to develop into a Suez/Panama Canal-like project to shorten
trips for its oil laden, China-bound tankers.
Thailand also serves as an
overland conduit, running north and south as in Pakistan, with a developed
rail system connecting Singapore's shipping yards to Laos' capital of
Vientiane. China has begun the
development of a rail system through Laos and
the upgrading of Thailand's rail system. Thailand also is one of the world's
largest rice exporters, which makes the nation vital to China's future
growth.
It is no surprise then, that Thailand, like Myanmar, has suffered multiple
attempts by the US to affect regime change.
Their man, Thaksin Shinawatra is
an overt globalist, having formally served as an adviser to
the Carlyle
Group, and since his ousting from power in 2006, has been lobbied for by
everyone from James Baker's Baker Botts, to ICG's Kenneth Adelman and the
Edelman PR firm, to his current lobbyist and lawyer, Robert Amsterdam.
It is quite clear that Washington is using its control of the Middle East
and its control of the seas, albeit challenged control, to check China's
vastly superior financial and economic position.
It is also clear that
Washington is investing a great amount of military resources and
intelligence assets to destabilize the entire "String of Pearls" to
confound, contain, and leverage concessions from China, with the ultimate
goal of folding the emerging Asian giant into the unipolar Anglo-American
global order.
How well this strategy is working is debatable, however, the US military is
politically hobbled, strategically stretched, and led by vastly incompetent
leaders in Washington who have lost the faith and trust of their own
population, not to mention the world. The bold and perhaps desperate gambit
the US is playing out in the Middle East could be a bid to rectify years of
failure against China and the Shanghai Cooperative since the SSI wrote their
report in 2006.
Regime change in Iran is still the linchpin in making this
latest bid a success.
South America
Even South America is not spared.
There has been a lull in overt American
meddling, allowing South America to become a bastion of sorts against the
agents of globalization, however, covert operations and staging has been
ongoing.
Troubling reports coming from South America's Argentina, no stranger to the
ire of Anglo-American ambitions, indicate that tension is building up
between Buenos Aires and Washington. It has culminated in a diplomatic row
over a recently seized US C-17 transport chalk full of suspicious equipment
and an even more suspicious explanation.
This is leading many,
including the government
of Argentina, to believe the US is staging another round of destabilization
efforts in South America.
Venezuela and Bolivia have been overtly targeted by the West in recent years
by efforts to undermine and even overthrow their respective governments. The
muted-confused response over the coup in Honduras also raises suspicions
that America has begun striking back against the wave of regional
nationalism sweeping South America.
A visit over to Movements.org reveals that the
US State Department/corporate funded organization is
backing dissidents in
Venezuela and encouraging the spread of "civil society," gleefully noting
the insidious effects it is having on bolstering the anti-Chavez opposition.
Conclusion
The recent US-backed wave of revolution sweeping the Middle East is just the
beginning of a greater move to dislodge Iran and begin regaining ground
against Russia and China after several years of disappointing results
geopolitically.
The ultimate goal in mind is to force Russia and China to
accept their role as "responsible stakeholders" in the unipolar
Anglo-American "new world order."
The unipolar world of Anglo-American
financier domination requires that all competition be eliminated, all
nations become interdependent, and most importantly, all governments conform
to the globalists' model of "civil society" which in turn answers to
centralized global institutions.
Understanding the overarching plan reveals the danger of being apathetic or
complacent about the current unrest in the Middle East. It will surely
spread, and depending on the Shanghai Cooperative's response and their
determination to remain the masters of their own destiny, greater
confrontation may ensue.
For the United States and its dwindling power, its
meaningless offers to the world's nations to join their bankrupt, one-sided
model of world governance, and their growing economic mire, there is no
telling what their desperation may transform into.
This unpredictability and
desperation may be perhaps the only card they have left in their hand worth
playing, and one that should trouble us all.
