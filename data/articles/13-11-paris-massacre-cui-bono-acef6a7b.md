# 13/11 Paris Massacre - Cui Bono?

French intel swears they are monitoring at least 200
nationals who came back from "Syraq". Talk about a lousy
job. Paris is hyper-policed. The mind boggles thinking of at
least 8 jihadis promenading at will on a Friday night
dressed as pro killers.
They picked a mix of heavily symbolic venues. You have a
France-German match witnessed by the President in a stadium
where all barriers - ethnic, religious - dissolve, a true
symbol of multiculturalism.
You have a gig by an American band in a concert hall filled
with young people. You have your average, cool, neighborhood
caf√©s in the 10eme and 11eme, young, hip, secular, bobo
Paris hoods.
This points to a calibrated conceptual spectrum - carefully
mapped out by French insiders; perhaps those "Syraq"
returnees. This also points to a monumental fail by French
intel and the Ministry of Interior.
Timing: crucial...
Just as the US/Brits announce they "may" have evaporated
with Jihad John.
And a few hours before the Vienna talks are supposed to come
up with an official Top Ten terrorist list in Syria.
As
always, the honest response to the question
cui bono
might be the last (and perhaps major) victim of the
13/11 tragedy in Paris.
Several strong voices in favor of
internal false flag version have already
appeared, while the weak French
government and secret services totally relying on 'American
partners' are hardly possessing enough resources to orchestrate
the drama of such scale.
The underline reading of the
hot-caked Stratfor report on the Paris attacks (certainly
presuming undutiful and entire Islamic State involvement)
suggests that the American
neocons want to see a bigger French boot on the ground in
Syraq.
(More elaboration on NATO's
mobilization as a result of 13/11 is done by Patrick
Henningsen
from 21st Century Wire.)
They were also not satisfied by the
French resilience to fully tumble into the pan-European refugee
turmoil and general public indifference to
anti-Islamic provocateurs from Charlie
Hebdo.
The only side effect
bothering Stratfor analysts is the apparent rise of Marine Le
Pen which, according to them, should be nipped by setting
Nikolas Sarkozy at the same electoral field.
As a matter of fact, the bloody night in Paris
was launched to definitely bury the European project as it was
originally seen in Paris and Berlin - economically powerful and
politically sovereign concert of nations.
The symbolism of attacks' initiation
near Stad du France during the France-Germany friendly match is
obvious.
We will not be surprised if the
French investigation of the attack would discover a clear
German trace of the perpetrators. The rules of the genre
demand such storyline.
Very few in Europe are still
taking seriously the immutable fact that the European Union
allied with the Eurasian resource base is even a bigger
nightmare for the Wall Street owners than the established
Russia-China alliance (please read more on the issue in our
yesterday's update
Grandmaster Putin's Trap-2).
The incumbent Wall
Street-controlled EU bureaucracy is rapidly loosing not only
public support in the European countries (it is mauvais ton
in Brussels to raise this question for long already), but of the
local business elites and other power groups.
Replacement of the old EU
bureaucracy by new representatives who would take the way of
sovereignization of Europe was at the public request in the
continent and seriously challenged the transatlantic partnership
(didn't you forget French trade minister Matthias Fekl
threat to quit TTIP talks last
month?).
Reinforcing the latter was the
urgent task of the Wall Street political stooges on both sides
of the ocean.
Once the Ukrainian project
factually failed and due to the notable shift in French approach
towards the European Eastern policy, a foundation of
the new transatlantic consensus was desperately needed.
Black banner nearby
Eiffel was virtually hoisted on the screens to disguide
people from much more acute issues:
what is the real agenda behind
destabilization of the Middle East and where do the European
interests rest in this regard?
So
cui bono from this attack?
A qui profite le crime, France?
The propaganda cartoon,
distributed on Saturday by the 'USA
Today'
confirms the conclusions of this
commentary.
