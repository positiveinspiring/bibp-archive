President
Barack
Obama and leaders of the European Union (EU) issued a Joint
Statement at their March 26 meeting in Brussels declaring, among other
things, their coordinated position on assistance to the Ukraine, as well as
their continued flogging of the discredited "climate change"
alarmism, and commitment to conclude the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement between the
EU and the United States.
The Joint Statement also reiterated support for
the World Trade Organization and the United Nations, as well as support for
UN/NATO military intervention in Africa, and implementation of various
disarmament treaties,
including the UN Arms Trade Treaty that targets the Second Amendment and
the rights of individual U.S. citizens to keep and bear firearms.
President Obama, meeting with European Council
President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, emphasized that,
"Europe, including the European Union, is
the cornerstone of our engagement around the world. We are more secure
and we are more prosperous, the world is safer and more just, when
Europe and America stand as one."
"We, the leaders of the European Union and
the United States, met today in Brussels to reaffirm our strong
partnership," the trio declared in opening paragraph of their Joint
Statement.
They
continued:
"We seek a landmark Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership to build our common prosperity. We undertake
joint efforts to build security and stability around the globe and to
tackle pressing global challenges like climate change."
Concerning Ukraine, the Joint Statement says:
Today in Ukraine, the basic principles of
international law and security in the 21st century are being challenged. The
EU and the US support the Ukrainian people and their right to choose their
own future and remain committed to uphold the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Ukraine...
The EU and the US stand by the Ukrainian government
in its efforts to stabilize Ukraine and undertake reforms, including through
assistance.
In Section 5 of the Joint Statement, the U.S.-EU
leaders returned to the TTIP agenda.
"Today we reaffirmed our commitment to
conclude expeditiously a comprehensive and ambitious Transatlantic Trade
and Investment Partnership (TTIP)," they proclaimed, asserting further
that, "we commit ourselves to conducting these negotiations with clarity
and in a manner that builds support among our publics."
However, if President Obama and his EU
colleagues were truly interested in "conducting these negotiations with
clarity" and building genuine public support for the TTIP, they would end
the secrecy that has enveloped the TTIP process from the beginning.
As we have reported ("Secretly
Trading Away Our Independence" and "EU/U.S.
- Transatlantic Convergence"), the TTIP process has been kept secret not
only from the press and the American public, but even from our elected
representatives in the U.S. Congress, while privileged corporate and
activist NGO representatives have been allowed not only to see the text, but
to provide input to the negotiation process.
The TTIP proposes to extend the
political-economic "integration" process, by which the central EU authority
in Brussels is swallowing up the sovereignty of its member states, across
the Atlantic, to entangle the United States in the same
independence-crushing process.
Several days before President Obama headed to
Brussels, his point man on the TTIP, U.S. Trade Representative Michael
Froman (shown above), said that he wants a trans-Atlantic trade deal to
be as strong as the longstanding NATO alliance between the United States and
Europe,
"We want for TTIP [Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership] to help build an economic and a trade
relationship that is as strong as the strongest military alliance in the
world, but fundamentally it has to be driven by the underlying
economics,"
Froman said at The Atlantics
annual Economy Summit in Washington.
White House/Pratt House
Merger Campaign
In announcing his desire to craft a TTIP that
would be the equivalent of an economic NATO, Froman was not speaking only
(or even primarily) for the Obama White House, but also for Pratt House, the
headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the globalist brain
trust that has been the guiding subversive force behind U.S. administrations
(both Democrat and Republican) for much of the past century.
Froman is a CFR member, as is his boss,
Secretary of State John Kerry, Under Secretary of State Robert D. Hormats,
and many of the other top officials at State and other Cabinet departments.
(see, "CFR
Applauds European Unions Real Subversion of Sovereignty'.")
In a previous
article we provided more background on Froman:
The man leading Team Obamas trade offensive is
Michael Froman, assistant to the president of the United States and deputy
national security advisor for international economic affairs.
A Wall Street insider, Froman was a managing
director at Citigroup, and also served as president and chief executive
officer of CitiInsurance before joining the Obama administration.
No doubt his previous service in Brussels with
the Forward Studies Unit of the European Commission also figured in his
appointment, though to Americans in the know this entry on his résumé would
be recognized as at least cause for concern, if not an outright negative.
Although virtually an unknown to the vast
majority of Americans, Froman is definitely known in the higher circles of
power that determine the economic and political fates of nations.
Froman is not only a member of the
Council on
Foreign Relations and the more exclusive
Trilateral Commission, but also a
member of that super-secret, super-elite annual gathering known as the
Bilderberg Group.
He is thus qualified to serve as the lead "Sherpa" guiding
U.S. policy at the G7, G8, and G20 summits.
And Fromans fellow globalists in the CFR-dominated
"mainstream" media could be counted on to ignore, cover up, or minimize his
egregious corruption and conflicts of interest in the massive bailout of his
employer (Citigroup) - which netted him $7.4 million, including a $2.25
million year-end bonus for 2008.
In addition, Froman reportedly played the
central role in hiring New York Fed chief Timothy Geithner (CFR, TC) as
Obamas treasury secretary, even while Geithner was engineering the massive
taxpayer bailout of Citigroup.
And to make matters even more incestuously
corrupt, Froman hired Jamie Rubin, the son of Citigroup CEO Robert Rubin (CFR,
former Clinton treasury secretary, former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs), as
a headhunter for the Obama transition team.
Instead of spending time in prison for
fraudulent mortgaged-backed "collateralized debt obligations" that enriched
Citigroup and helped bring on the economic crisis, Rubin, Geithner, Froman,
and company made off like bandits.
Remember this when Froman and Obama talk about
"transparency" and the supposed benefits of TTIP.
Arthur Thompson, CEO of The John Birch
Society, warns that the Joint Statement by President Obama and the EU
leaders should sound very loud alarm bells for the American people.
"It should be very apparent to all who take
the time to read the Joint Statement that President Obama, Barroso and
Van Rompuy are exposing their real, hidden intentions," he told
The New American.
"They are holding out the carrot of trade
with all its false promises of prosperity and jobs, but they are also
tying it together with global-warming regulations, Ukraine aid, the EU
banking union, NATO military intervention around the globe, and UN
disarmament treaties, including the very dangerous Arms Trade Treaty.
They are trying to tie our hands down in all
of these areas, so that we will not be able to act independently in our
own interests, as a free, sovereign, independent nation."
The U.S.-EU Brussels Summit confirms, says
Thompson, the wisdom of Americas Founding Fathers in opposing entangling
alliances with European powers and other foreign nations.
"The Founders disagreed among themselves on
many things," he noted, "but they all agreed that, while our people
should be free to trade and carry on a wide array of relations with the
peoples of other nations, our government must not be allowed to entangle
our political and economic system with those of other nations.
That is why we must oppose the Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership and alert more Americans to the very
real threats that the TTIP poses on multiple fronts."
