Volume I - Part I
Introduction to the
Financial Elite
Before covering the specific groups which are likely responsible for
creating the Hidden Evil, it's necessary to explain that the United States
and other NATO countries are not run by their respective leaders.
The power structure does not operate in the
manner taught in public schools. The evidence I'll be presenting suggests
that these nations are run by an elite cabal of wealthy individuals who
prefer to operate from behind the scenes.
This group has been called the Establishment,
the Secret Brotherhood, the Alliance, the Invisible Government, the Shadow
Government, a legal mafia, the New World Order, the Illuminati, the
Insiders, the Military-industrial Complex, etc.(*)
In an article entitled, Elite Clique Holds Power in the U.S., which appeared
in the Indianapolis News on December 23, 1961, Edith Kermit Roosevelt wrote,
"The word 'Establishment' is a general term
for the power elite in international finance, business, the professions
and government, largely from the northeast, who wield most of the power
regardless of who is in the White House. Most people are unaware of the
existence of this 'legitimate Mafia.'"
She described,
"The power of the Establishment makes itself
felt from the professor who seeks a foundation grant, to the candidate
for a cabinet post or State Department job. It affects the nation's
policies in almost every area."
Most people can sense that something is wrong,
but can't quite put their finger on what it is.
Despite changes in administration every four
years, the planet continues to fall apart. Professor Sutton stated in his
book, Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler,
"Wars are started (and stopped) with no
shred of coherent explanation. Political words have never matched
political deeds."
The reason, he asserted, is,
"because the center of political power has
been elsewhere than with elected and presumably responsive
representatives in Washington, and this power elite has its own
objectives, which are inconsistent with those of the public at large."
On March 26, 1922, the Mayor of New York City,
John F. Hylan said,
"The real menace of our republic is the
invisible government which, like a giant octopus, sprawls its slimly
length over our city, state and nation. At the head is a small group of
banking houses generally referred to as 'international bankers.' This
little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run our
government for their own selfish ends."
Congressman Lawrence P. McDonald wrote in
November of 1975,
"Money alone is not enough to quench the
thirst and lusts of the super-rich. Instead, many of them use their vast
wealth, and the influence such riches give them, to achieve even more
power. Power of a magnitude never dreamed of by the tyrants and despots
of earlier ages. Power on a worldwide scale. Power over people, not just
products."
In his book Dark Majesty, Professor Texe Marrs
added,
"The men at the top of the empire are
billionaires many times over. Yet they still want more money."
Author James Perloff describes the typical path
of one of these individuals, in his book, The Shadows of Power. He writes
that it "begins in private schools, the most famous being Groton.
From these they have typically proceeded to
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or Columbia, there entering exclusive
fraternities, such as Yale's secretive Skull and Bones... From academia they
have customarily progressed to Wall Street, perhaps joining an international
investment bank, such as Chase Manhattan, or a prominent law firm or
brokerage house."
He continues,
"Some of the politically inclined have
signed on with the establishment think tanks like the Brookings
Institution and the Rand Corporation," and "a few have found themselves
on the boards of vast foundations."
From there, states Perloff, they ascend into,
"high positions in the federal government,"
which requires membership in a "New York-based group called the Council
on Foreign Relations."
Professor Marrs declared,
"Five major groups-Banking and Money,
Political, Intelligence, Religious, and Educational-are under the
immediate direction and control of this small band of men."
Everybody has heard of the "they" who seem to be
in control of things.
"Whatever we call this self-perpetuating
elitist group," explained Professor Sutton, "it is apparently
fundamentally significant in the determination of world affairs, at a
level far behind and above that of the elected politicians."
Before we explore who they are, I should point
out that throughout this book you'll notice a steady pattern of the
following:
-
They disguise themselves and their
intentions by creating groups which profess only the most innocent
objectives. In this manner, they masquerade as humanitarians.
-
They frequently resort to lying and
deceiving to accomplish their objectives.
-
They often use the National Security Act
to justify their destructive deeds and to provide cover when they
get caught.
So who are "they?"
Apparently, Wall Street, multinational
corporations, international banks and wealthy people have formed elite
groups to serve as vehicles for their interests.
These include Think Tanks such as,
...and others, which are interlocked with the
Tax-exempt Foundations and the Federal Reserve.
According to Professor Sutton, Think Tanks, the
Federal Reserve, the Executive Branch of the White House, Law, Education,
and Media are all interlocked at the top, and controlled by an elite cabal.
"We should realize that many of these groups
are closely allied together," agreed Professor Marrs.
"In some cases," he said, "the same man may
simultaneously serve as either president or on the board of directors of
a banking and money institution, a political group, an intelligence
organization, a religious denomination or organization, and a foundation
or educational group."
Perloff acknowledged this interlock too, when he
stated that their members serve "on the boards of vast foundations," such as
"Rockefeller, Ford, and Carnegie."
Rene Wormser, General Council to the Reece Committee which investigated
Tax-exempt Foundations, provides us with an example of interlocking
directorates. In his book, Foundations: Their Power And Influence, he
sites a report from a congressional investigation by the Reece Committee,
concerning the Rand Corporation.
He states,
"This is a corporation in the nature of a
foundation, which plays a very important part in government research. It
would warrant special attention in connection with any study of the
extent to which foundation interlocks have influenced government."
"Among the trustees and officers of The Rand Corporation," continues
Wormser, "were found [by the Reece Committee] the following who had
material connections with other foundations: Charles Dollard (trustee),
Carnegie Corporation; L.A. Dudbridge (trustee), Carnegie Endowment
National Science Foundation; H. Rowan Gaither, Jr. (trustee) Ford
Foundation; Philip E. Mosely (trustee), Ford Foundation... Frederick F.
Stephan (trustee), Rockefeller Foundation ... Hans Speier (officer)
(Ford) Behavioral Science Division..."
These Think Tanks hold regular meetings, which
are not open to the public. According to a book entitled, Who's Who of the
Elite, by Robert Gaylon Ross, topics of conversation include wars.
He explained,
"[they] decide when wars should start, how
long they should last, when they should end, who will and will not
participate, the changes in boundaries of countries resulting from the
outcome of these wars, who will lend the money to support the war
efforts, and who will lend the money to rebuild the countries after they
have been destroyed by war."
"They own the central banks," continued Ross, "such as the Federal
Reserve System in the US, and similar organizations in all major
countries throughout the world, and therefore are in a position to
determine discount rates, prime rates ... [&] what countries should
receive loans (guaranteed by the taxpayers of the respective
countries)...
They decide who will be allowed to run for
the offices of President, Prime Minister, Chancellor, Governor General,
or other names applied to the leaders of all major countries around the
world." In addition, they, "directly or indirectly own all the major
news media, and can therefore tell the public exactly what they want
them to hear, and deny the public information they do not want them to
see, hear, or read."
If the general population knew that a handful of
unelected people were running their government they would probably be
outraged.
This "legitimate mafia" prefers to remain behind
the scenes, apparently so people will still believe they live in a
constitutional republic. But their existence is not completely hidden. By
incident, or accident, people such as targeted individuals,
corporate/government whistleblowers and others, have directly experienced
how government really works and who controls it.
Their experience on the front lines have given
them insights into approaching situations that the general population is not
yet aware of.
"Secret elitist groups always censor, or try
to censor, news about their covert activities," declared Antony Sutton
and Patrick Wood in their book, Trilaterals Over Washington.
"Censorship stems from the overall need for
secrecy, to conceal from the world at large. As long as Trilaterals (and
Bilderbergers and other elite groups) skulk around the world convening
closed meetings in secluded corners with security guards to keep out the
press then we may conclude that Trilaterals, Bilderbergers, and the rest
have something to hide."
Most members of these elite organizations are
not aware of their true objectives.
According to these researchers, there is an
inner-core of members that are.
"These members are aware of only about 50%,
or less of the goals, and objectives of the Global Union movement,"
proclaimed Ross. "A large number of these people are members for ego,
and social reasons only," and would probably resign if they were to
"find out what the Global Union is 'really' up to."
These elite organizations have been called Think
Tanks or modern secret societies.(**)
Some receive their funding from Tax-exempt
Foundations.
"The existence of groups like the Trilateral
Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, and the Bilderbergers is well
documented," stated Jim Marrs in his underground bestseller, Rule by
Secrecy. "The only question is the extent of their control and
manipulation of major world events."
"Likewise," said Marrs, "there is no question that members of these
societies exert inordinate control over many of the largest corporations
and banks in the world. These corporations, in turn, control essential
minerals, energy, transportation, pharmaceuticals, agriculture,
telecommunications, and entertainment-in other words, the basics of
modern life."
When these policies are set at the top by the
controlling elite who have been known to promote a one-world socialist
order, then it's understandable how destructive policies, which appear to be
positive, can be filtered down to local and state governments.
Marrs explained,
"If the top leadership of government and
business is controlled ... then the activities of subservient agencies
and divisions must be of little consequence. Government bureaucrats -
honest and well-intentioned workers for the most part - simply follow
orders and policies set by superiors."
Former FBI Agent Dan Smoot acknowledged this
covert power structure in his book, The Invisible Government, when he wrote,
"Somewhere at the top of the pyramid in the
invisible government are a few sinister people who know exactly what
they are doing..."
The invisible government that Smoot refers to
has established identifiable groups, which it uses as vehicles to carry out
its policies.
In his bestselling book, None Dare Call It
Conspiracy, Author Gary Allen, declared that they have "established some
very special and highly influential organizations, many of which have
clandestine aims and goals."
He lists some of these groups as,
"the Bilderbergers, the Club of Rome, the
Aspen Institute, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign
Relations, [and] the Bohemian Grove."
Local, state, and federal law enforcement are
reportedly controlled by these Think Tanks.
"The Elite control our courts, the Pentagon,
the U.N., NATO, N.S.A., C.I.A., F.B.I., B.A.T.F., our Senate and House
of Representatives," charged Ross, "and directly or indirectly control
all local law enforcement agencies."
Author Marrs agreed that government agencies
under control of these elite groups include,
"not only the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA)," he said "but the National Security Council (NSC), Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA), National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF),
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), and many others." He added, "These agencies are themselves
secretive, citing reasons of national security, [&] executive
privilege."
"The Rockefellers, Rothschilds, and a few
others - numbering less than a dozen leaders of international finance
are the real power behind the visible thrones of world government,"
observed Professor Marrs.
"No major policy is formulated without their
input; no major plan of action is implemented without their specific
'go' signal."
One of my goals is to show you who "they" are,
what they've done, how they've covered it up, and what their plans are.
Throughout the rest of this book, myself & other
authors will periodically refer to these interlocking Think Tanks using the
abbreviations, BB for Bilderberg, TC for Trilateral Commission, and CFR for
Council on Foreign Relations.
Now I'll explain these elite groups in more
detail. Let's meet your unelected rulers.
Footnotes
* From the information I've come across, the
term New World Order has been used to describe three things: a political
movement, a group of individuals bringing about the movement, and joint
reference to both the movement and the group fostering it. My
understanding is that the term refers to the movement.
** Some literature describes these organizations as think tanks or
modern secret societies, and others describe them as foundations.
Carnegie Endowment is listed as a foundation in Foundations: Their Power
and Influence by Wormser, but also listed as a think tank in Who's Who
of the Elite by Ross, and Trilaterals Over Washington by Sutton and
Wood. Author Marrs describes the CFR, TC and Bilderbergers as modern
secret societie
