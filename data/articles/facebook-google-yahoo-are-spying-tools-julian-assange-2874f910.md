fight
-
the Guantanamo and US Cable files

and The New York Times

He famously warns that social media and in particularly Facebook, Google,
Yahoo are among the greatest spy machines ever invented.
Once again Mr. Assange demonstrates his intelligence, authenticity and consciousness.
The man behind
WikiLeaks says his websites revelations are just the tip of
the iceberg.
It is only a matter of time before more damaging information
becomes known.
Its not a matter of serving a subpoena,
they have an interface they have developed for US Intelligence to use.
Now, is the case that Facebook is run by US Intelligence? No, its not
like that. Its simply that US Intelligence is able to bring to bear
legal and political pressure to them.
