The world's rivers, the single largest renewable
water resource for humans and a crucible of aquatic biodiversity, are in a
crisis of ominous proportions, according to a new global analysis.
The report, published Sept. 30 (2010) in the journal Nature, is the first to
simultaneously account for the effects of such things as,
The resulting portrait of the global riverine
environment, according to the scientists who conducted the analysis, is
grim.
It reveals that nearly 80 percent of the
world's human population lives in areas where river waters are highly
threatened posing a major threat to human water security and resulting in
aquatic environments where thousands of species of plants and animals are at
risk of extinction.
"Rivers around the world really are in a
crisis state," says Peter B. McIntyre, a senior author of the new study
and a professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's
Center for Limnology.
The Nature report was authored by an
international team co-led by Charles J. Vörösmarty of the City
University of New York, an expert on global water resources, and McIntyre,
an expert on freshwater biodiversity.
Examining the influence of numerous types of threats to water quality and
aquatic life across all of the world's river systems, the study is the first
to explicitly assess both human water security and biodiversity in parallel.
Fresh water is widely regarded as the world's
most essential natural resource, underpinning human life and economic
development as well as the existence of countless organisms ranging from
microscopic life to fish, amphibians, birds and terrestrial animals of all
kinds.
Over many millennia, humans have exerted an increasingly pervasive influence
on fresh water resources.
Rivers, in particular, have attracted humans and
have been altered through damming, irrigation and other agricultural and
engineering practices since the advent of civilization. In recent times,
chemical pollution, burgeoning human populations, and the accidental as well
as purposeful global redistribution of plants, fish, and other animal
species have had far-reaching effects on rivers and their aquatic
inhabitants.
"Flowing rivers represent the largest single
renewable water resource for humans," notes Vörösmarty. "What we've
discovered is that when you map out these many sources of threat, you
see a fully global syndrome of river degradation."
What jumps out, say McIntyre and Vörösmarty, is
that rivers in different parts of the world are subject to similar types of
stresses, such things as,
...and other factors.
Compounding the problem is that some of the
negative influences on rivers arrive in indirect ways.
Mercury pollution, for example, is a
byproduct of electricity generation at coal-fired power plants
and pollutes surface water via the atmosphere.
"We find a real stew of chemicals flowing
through our waterways," explains Vörösmarty, noting that the study
represents a state-of-the-art summary, yet was unable to account for
such things as threats from mining, the growing number of
pharmaceuticals found in surface water and the synergistic effects of
all the stresses affecting rivers.
"And what we're doing is treating the symptoms of a larger problem,"
Vörösmarty explains.
"We know it is far more cost effective to
protect these water systems in the first place. So the current emphasis
on treating the symptoms rather than the underlying causes makes little
sense from a water security standpoint or a biodiversity standpoint, or
for that matter an economic standpoint."
Among the startling conclusions of the study is
that rivers in the developed world, including much of the United States
and Western Europe, are under severe threat despite decades of attention
to pollution control and investments in environmental protection.
Huge investments in water technology and
treatment reduce threats to humans, but mainly in developed nations, and
leave biodiversity in both developed and developing countries under high
levels of threat, according to the new report.
"What made our jaws drop is that some of the
highest threat levels in the world are in the United States and Europe,"
says McIntyre, who began work on the project as a Smith Fellow at the
University of Michigan.
"Americans tend to think water pollution
problems are pretty well under control, but we still face enormous
challenges."
The hard lessons learned by the developed world,
says McIntyre, can help governments and planners in other parts of the world
avoid making the same mistakes and experiment with new strategies for
promoting water security and protecting biodiversity. Instead of investing
billions of dollars in expensive remediation technologies, strategies such
as protecting watersheds, for example, can reduce the costs of drinking
water treatment, preserve floodplains for flood protection and enhance rural
livelihoods.
Rivers of the world least at risk are those where human populations are
smallest. Rivers in arctic regions and relatively inaccessible areas of the
tropics appear to be in the best health.
The analysis used data sets on river stressors around the world. Built into
state-of-the-art computer models, the data yield maps that integrate all of
the individual stressors into aggregate indices of threat.
The same strategy and data, say Vörösmarty and
McIntyre, can be used by governments worldwide to assess river health and
improve approaches to protecting human and biodiversity interests.
"We've created a systematic framework to
look at the human water security and biodiversity domains on an equal
footing," Vörösmarty says. "We can now begin presenting different
options to decision makers to create environmental blueprints for the
future."
