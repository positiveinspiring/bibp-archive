Seymour M. Hersh on
Obama, Erdogan and the Syrian rebels
In 2011
Barack
Obama led an allied military intervention in Libya without
consulting the US Congress.
Last August, after
the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of
Ghouta, he was ready to launch an allied air strike, this time to punish the
Syrian government for allegedly crossing the 'red line' he had set in 2012
on the use of chemical weapons.
Then with less than two days to go before the
planned strike, he announced that he would seek congressional approval for
the intervention.
The strike was postponed as Congress prepared
for hearings, and subsequently cancelled when Obama accepted Assad's offer
to relinquish his chemical arsenal in a deal brokered by Russia.
Why did Obama delay and then relent on Syria
when he was not shy about rushing into Libya?
The answer lies in a clash between those in the
administration who were committed to enforcing the red line, and military
leaders who thought that going to war was both unjustified and potentially
disastrous.
Obama's change of mind had its origins at
Porton Down, the defense laboratory in
Wiltshire.
British intelligence had obtained a sample of
the sarin used in the 21 August attack and analysis demonstrated that the
gas used didn't match the batches known to exist in the Syrian army's
chemical weapons arsenal. The message that the case against Syria wouldn't
hold up was quickly relayed to the US joint chiefs of staff.
The British report heightened doubts inside the
Pentagon; the joint chiefs were already preparing to warn Obama that his
plans for a far-reaching bomb and missile attack on Syria's infrastructure
could lead to a wider war in the Middle East.
As a consequence the American officers delivered
a last-minute caution to the president, which, in their view, eventually led
to his cancelling the attack.
For months there had been acute concern among senior military leaders and
the intelligence community about the role in the war of Syria's neighbors,
especially Turkey.
Prime Minister Recep Erdoğan was known to
be supporting the
al-Nusra Front, a jihadist faction among
the rebel opposition, as well as other Islamist rebel groups.
'We knew there were some in the Turkish
government,' a former senior US intelligence official, who has access to
current intelligence, told me, 'who believed they could get Assad's nuts
in a vice by dabbling with a sarin attack inside Syria - and forcing
Obama to make good on his red line threat.'
The joint chiefs also knew that the Obama
administration's public claims that only the Syrian army had access to sarin
were wrong. The American and British intelligence communities had been aware
since the spring of 2013 that some rebel units in Syria were developing
chemical weapons.
On 20 June analysts for the US Defense
Intelligence Agency issued a highly classified five-page 'talking points'
briefing for the DIA's deputy director, David Shedd, which stated
that al-Nusra maintained a sarin production cell: its program, the paper
said, was,
'the most advanced sarin plot since
al-Qaida's pre-9/11 effort'.
(According to a Defense Department
consultant, US intelligence has long known that al-Qaida experimented
with chemical weapons, and has a video of one of its gas experiments
with dogs.)
The DIA paper went on:
'Previous IC [intelligence community] focus
had been almost entirely on Syrian CW [chemical weapons] stockpiles; now
we see ANF attempting to make its own CW
Al-Nusrah Front's relative
freedom of operation within Syria leads us to assess the group's CW
aspirations will be difficult to disrupt in the future.'
The paper drew on classified intelligence from
numerous agencies:
'Turkey and Saudi-based chemical
facilitators,' it said, 'were attempting to obtain sarin precursors in
bulk, tens of kilograms, likely for the anticipated large scale
production effort in Syria.'
(Asked about the DIA paper, a spokesperson
for the director of national intelligence said: 'No such paper was ever
requested or produced by intelligence community analysts.')
Last May, more than ten members of the al-Nusra
Front were arrested in southern Turkey with what local police told the press
were two kilograms of sarin.
In a 130-page indictment the group was accused
of attempting to purchase fuses, piping for the construction of mortars, and
chemical precursors for sarin. Five of those arrested were freed after a
brief detention.
The others, including the ringleader, Haytham
Qassab, for whom the prosecutor requested a prison sentence of 25 years,
were released pending trial. In the meantime the Turkish press has been rife
with speculation that the Erdoğan administration has been covering up the
extent of its involvement with the rebels.
In a news conference last summer, Aydin
Sezgin, Turkey's ambassador to Moscow, dismissed the arrests and claimed
to reporters that the recovered 'sarin' was merely 'anti-freeze'.
The DIA paper took the arrests as evidence that al-Nusra was expanding its
access to chemical weapons. It said Qassab had 'self-identified' as a member
of al-Nusra, and that he was directly connected to Abd-al-Ghani, the 'ANF
emir for military manufacturing'.
Qassab and his associate Khalid Ousta
worked with Halit Unalkaya, an employee of a Turkish firm called
Zirve Export, who provided,
'price quotes for bulk quantities of sarin
precursors'.
Abd-al-Ghani's plan was for two associates to,
'perfect a process for making sarin, then go
to Syria to train others to begin large scale production at an
unidentified lab in Syria'.
The DIA paper said that one of his operatives
had purchased a precursor on the,
'Baghdad chemical market', which 'has
supported at least seven CW efforts since 2004'.
A series of chemical weapon attacks in March and
April 2013 was investigated over the next few months by a special UN mission
to Syria.
A person with close knowledge of
the
United Nations' activity in Syria told me that there was evidence
linking the Syrian opposition to the first gas attack, on 19 March in Khan
Al-Assal, a village near Aleppo.
In its final report in December, the mission
said that at least 19 civilians and one Syrian soldier were among the
fatalities, along with scores of injured.
It had no mandate to assign responsibility for
the attack, but the person with knowledge of the UN's activities said:
'Investigators interviewed the people who
were there, including the doctors who treated the victims. It was clear
that the rebels used the gas. It did not come out in public because no
one wanted to know.'
In the months before the attacks began, a former
senior Defense Department official told me, the DIA was circulating a daily
classified report known as SYRUP on all intelligence related to the Syrian
conflict, including material on chemical weapons.
But in the spring, distribution of the part of
the report concerning chemical weapons was severely curtailed on the orders
of Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff.
'Something was in there that triggered a
shit fit by McDonough,' the former Defense Department official said.
'One day it was a huge deal, and then, after the March and April sarin
attacks' - he snapped his fingers - 'it's no longer there.'
The decision to restrict distribution was made
as the joint chiefs ordered intensive contingency planning for a possible
ground invasion of Syria whose primary objective would be the elimination of
chemical weapons.
The former intelligence official said that many in the US national security
establishment had long been troubled by the president's red line:
'The joint chiefs asked the White House,
"What does red line mean? How does that
translate into military orders? Troops on the ground? Massive
strike? Limited strike?"
They tasked military intelligence to study
how we could carry out the threat. They learned nothing more about the
president's reasoning.'
In the aftermath of the 21 August attack Obama
ordered the Pentagon to draw up targets for bombing.
Early in the process, the former intelligence
official said,
'the White House rejected 35 target sets
provided by the joint chiefs of staff as being insufficiently "painful"
to the Assad regime.'
The original targets included only military
sites and nothing by way of civilian infrastructure.
Under White House pressure, the US attack plan
evolved into 'a monster strike': two wings of B-52 bombers were shifted to
airbases close to Syria, and navy submarines and ships equipped with
Tomahawk missiles were deployed.
'Every day the target list was getting
longer,' the former intelligence official told me.
'The Pentagon planners said we can't use
only Tomahawks to strike at Syria's missile sites because their warheads
are buried too far below ground, so the two B-52 air wings with
two-thousand pound bombs were assigned to the mission. Then we'll need
standby search-and-rescue teams to recover downed pilots and drones for
target selection. It became huge.'
The new target list was meant to,
'completely eradicate any military
capabilities Assad had', the former intelligence official said.
The core targets included electric power grids,
oil and gas depots, all known logistic and weapons depots, all known command
and control facilities, and all known military and intelligence buildings.
Britain and France were both to play a part.
On 29 August, the day Parliament voted against
Cameron's bid to join the intervention, the Guardian reported that he
had already ordered six RAF Typhoon fighter jets to be deployed to Cyprus,
and had volunteered a submarine capable of launching Tomahawk missiles.
The French air force - a crucial player in the
2011 strikes on Libya - was deeply
committed, according to an account in Le Nouvel Observateur;
François Hollande had ordered several Rafale fighter-bombers to join the
American assault. Their targets were reported to be in western Syria.
By the last days of August the president had given the Joint Chiefs a fixed
deadline for the launch.
'H hour was to begin no later than Monday
morning [2 September (2013)], a massive assault to neutralize Assad,'
the former intelligence official said.
So it was a surprise to many when during a
speech in the White House Rose Garden on 31 August Obama said that the
attack would be put on hold, and he would turn to Congress and put it to a
vote.
At this stage, Obama's premise - that only the Syrian army was capable of
deploying sarin - was unraveling.
Within a few days of the 21 August attack, the
former intelligence official told me, Russian military intelligence
operatives had recovered samples of the chemical agent from Ghouta. They
analyzed it and passed it on to British military intelligence; this was the
material sent to Porton Down.
(A spokesperson for Porton Down said: 'Many of
the samples analyzed in the UK tested positive for the nerve agent sarin.'
MI6 said that it doesn't comment on intelligence matters.)
The former intelligence official said the Russian who delivered the sample
to the UK was,
'a good source - someone with access,
knowledge and a record of being trustworthy'.
After the first reported uses of chemical
weapons in Syria last year, American and allied intelligence agencies,
'made an effort to find the answer as to
what if anything, was used - and its source', the former intelligence
official said.
'We use data exchanged as part of the
Chemical Weapons Convention. The DIA's baseline consisted of knowing the
composition of each batch of Soviet-manufactured chemical weapons. But
we didn't know which batches the Assad government currently had in its
arsenal.
Within days of the Damascus incident we
asked a source in the Syrian government to give us a list of the batches
the government currently had. This is why we could confirm the
difference so quickly.'
The process hadn't worked as smoothly in the
spring, the former intelligence official said, because the studies done by
Western intelligence,
'were inconclusive as to the type of gas it
was. The word "sarin" didn't come up. There was a great deal of
discussion about this, but since no one could conclude what gas it was,
you could not say that Assad had crossed the president's red line.'
By 21 August, the former intelligence official
went on,
'the Syrian opposition clearly had learned
from this and announced that "sarin" from the Syrian army had been used,
before any analysis could be made, and the press and White House jumped
at it. Since it now was sarin, "It had to be Assad".'
The UK defence staff who relayed the Porton Down
findings to the joint chiefs were sending the Americans a message, the
former intelligence official said:
'We're being set up here.'
(This account made sense of a terse message
a senior official in the CIA sent in late August: 'It was not the result
of the current regime. UK & US know this.')
By then the attack was a few days away and
American, British and French planes, ships and submarines were at the ready.
The officer ultimately responsible for the planning and execution of the
attack was General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs. From
the beginning of the crisis, the former intelligence official said, the
joint chiefs had been skeptical of the administration's argument that it had
the facts to back up its belief in Assad's guilt.
They pressed the DIA and other agencies for more
substantial evidence.
'There was no way they thought Syria would
use nerve gas at that stage, because Assad was winning the war,' the
former intelligence official said.
Dempsey had irritated many in the Obama
administration by repeatedly warning Congress over the summer of the danger
of American military involvement in Syria.
Last April, after an optimistic assessment of
rebel progress by the secretary of state, John Kerry, in front of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that,
'there's a risk that this conflict has
become stalemated.'
Dempsey's initial view after 21 August was that
a US strike on Syria - under the assumption that the Assad government was
responsible for the sarin attack - would be a military blunder, the former
intelligence official said.
The Porton Down report caused the joint chiefs
to go to the president with a more serious worry: that the attack sought by
the White House would be an unjustified act of aggression. It was the joint
chiefs who led Obama to change course.
The official White House explanation for the
turnabout - the story the press corps told - was that the president, during
a walk in the Rose Garden with Denis McDonough, his chief of staff,
suddenly decided to seek approval for the strike from a bitterly divided
Congress with which he'd been in conflict for years.
The former Defense Department official told me
that the White House provided a different explanation to members of the
civilian leadership of the Pentagon: the bombing had been called off because
there was intelligence 'that the Middle East would go up in smoke' if it was
carried out.
The president's decision to go to Congress was initially seen by senior
aides in the White House, the former intelligence official said, as a replay
of George W. Bush's gambit in the autumn of 2002 before the invasion of
Iraq:
'When it became clear that there were no WMD
in Iraq, Congress, which had endorsed the Iraqi war, and the White House
both shared the blame and repeatedly cited faulty intelligence.
If the current Congress were to vote to
endorse the strike, the White House could again have it both ways -
wallop Syria with a massive attack and validate the president's red line
commitment, while also being able to share the blame with Congress if it
came out that the Syrian military wasn't behind the attack.'
The turnabout came as a surprise even to the
Democratic leadership in Congress.
In September the Wall Street Journal reported
that three days before his Rose Garden speech Obama had telephoned Nancy
Pelosi, leader of the House Democrats, 'to talk through the options'.
She later told colleagues, according to the
Journal, that she hadn't asked the president to put the bombing to a
congressional vote.
Obama's move for congressional approval quickly became a dead end.
'Congress was not going to let this go by,'
the former intelligence official said. 'Congress made it known that,
unlike the authorization for the Iraq war, there would be substantive
hearings.'
At this point, there was a sense of desperation
in the White House, the former intelligence official said.
'And so out comes Plan B. Call off the
bombing strike and Assad would agree to unilaterally sign the chemical
warfare treaty and agree to the destruction of all of chemical weapons
under UN supervision.'
At a press conference in London on 9 September,
Kerry was still talking about intervention:
'The risk of not acting is greater than the
risk of acting.'
But when a reporter asked if there was anything
Assad could do to stop the bombing, Kerry said:
'Sure. He could turn over every single bit
of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week
But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously.'
As the New York Times reported the next day, the
Russian-brokered deal that emerged shortly afterwards had first been
discussed by Obama and Putin in the summer of 2012.
Although the strike plans were shelved, the
administration didn't change its public assessment of the justification for
going to war.
'There is zero tolerance at that level for
the existence of error,' the former intelligence official said of the
senior officials in the White House.
'They could not afford to say:
"We were wrong".'
(The DNI spokesperson said: 'The Assad
regime, and only the Assad regime, could have been responsible for the
chemical weapons attack that took place on 21 August.')

The full extent of US co-operation with Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and Qatar in assisting the rebel opposition in Syria has yet to come
to light.
The Obama administration has never publicly
admitted to its role in creating what the CIA calls a 'rat line', a back
channel highway into Syria. The rat line, authorized in early 2012, was used
to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across
the Syrian border to the opposition.
Many of those in Syria who ultimately received
the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida. (The DNI
spokesperson said: 'The idea that the United States was providing weapons
from Libya to anyone is false.')
In January, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the
assault by a local militia in September 2012 on the American consulate and a
nearby undercover CIA facility in Benghazi, which resulted in the death of
the US ambassador, Christopher Stevens, and three others.
The report's criticism of the State Department
for not providing adequate security at the consulate, and of the
intelligence community for not alerting the US military to the presence of a
CIA outpost in the area, received front-page coverage and revived
animosities in Washington, with Republicans accusing Obama and Hillary
Clinton of a cover-up.
A highly classified annex to the report, not
made public, described a secret agreement reached in early 2012 between the
Obama and Erdoğan administrations. It pertained to the rat line.
By the terms of the agreement, funding came from
Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6,
was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi's arsenals into Syria. A
number of front companies were set up in Libya, some under the cover of
Australian entities. Retired American soldiers, who didn't always know who
was really employing them, were hired to manage procurement and shipping.
The operation was run by David Petraeus,
the CIA director who would soon resign when it became known he was having an
affair with his biographer. (A spokesperson for Petraeus denied the
operation ever took place.)
The operation had not been disclosed at the time it was set up to the
congressional intelligence committees and the congressional leadership, as
required by law since the 1970s. The involvement of MI6 enabled the CIA to
evade the law by classifying the mission as a liaison operation.
The former intelligence official explained that
for years there has been a recognized exception in the law that permits the
CIA not to report liaison activity to Congress, which would otherwise be
owed a finding. (All proposed CIA covert operations must be described in a
written document, known as a 'finding', submitted to the senior leadership
of Congress for approval.)
Distribution of the annex was limited to the
staff aides who wrote the report and to the eight ranking members of
Congress - the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate,
and the Democratic and Republicans leaders on the House and Senate
intelligence committees.
This hardly constituted a genuine attempt at
oversight: the eight leaders are not known to gather together to raise
questions or discuss the secret information they receive.
The annex didn't tell the whole story of what happened in Benghazi before
the attack, nor did it explain why the American consulate was attacked.
'The consulate's only mission was to provide
cover for the moving of arms,' the former intelligence official, who has
read the annex, said. 'It had no real political role.'
Washington abruptly ended the CIA's role in the
transfer of arms from Libya after the attack on the consulate, but the rat
line kept going.
'The United States was no longer in control
of what the Turks were relaying to the jihadists,' the former
intelligence official said.
Within weeks, as many as forty portable
surface-to-air missile launchers, commonly known as manpads, were in
the hands of Syrian rebels.
On 28 November 2012, Joby Warrick of the
Washington Post reported that the previous day rebels near Aleppo had used
what was almost certainly a manpad to shoot down a Syrian transport
helicopter.
'The Obama administration,' Warrick wrote,
'has steadfastly opposed arming Syrian opposition forces with such
missiles, warning that the weapons could fall into the hands of
terrorists and be used to shoot down commercial aircraft.'
Two Middle Eastern intelligence officials
fingered Qatar as the source, and a former US intelligence analyst
speculated that the manpads could have been obtained from Syrian military
outposts overrun by the rebels.
There was no indication that the rebels'
possession of manpads was likely the unintended consequence of a covert US
program that was no longer under US control.
By the end of 2012, it was believed throughout the American intelligence
community that the rebels were losing the war.
'Erdoğan was pissed,' the former
intelligence official said, 'and felt he was left hanging on the vine.
It was his money and the cut-off was seen as a betrayal.'
In spring 2013 US intelligence learned that the
Turkish government - through elements of the MIT, its national intelligence
agency, and the Gendarmerie, a militarized law-enforcement organization -
was working directly with al-Nusra and its allies to develop a chemical
warfare capability.
'The MIT was running the political liaison
with the rebels, and the Gendarmerie handled military logistics,
on-the-scene advice and training - including training in chemical
warfare,' the former intelligence official said.
'Stepping up Turkey's role in spring 2013
was seen as the key to its problems there. Erdoğan knew that if he
stopped his support of the jihadists it would be all over. The Saudis
could not support the war because of logistics - the distances involved
and the difficulty of moving weapons and supplies. Erdoğan's hope was to
instigate an event that would force the US to cross the red line. But
Obama didn't respond in March and April.'
There was no public sign of discord when Erdoğan
and Obama met on 16 May 2013 at the White House.
At a later press conference Obama said that they
had agreed that Assad 'needs to go'. Asked whether he thought Syria had
crossed the red line, Obama acknowledged that there was evidence such
weapons had been used, but added,
'it is important for us to make sure that
we're able to get more specific information about what exactly is
happening there.'
The red line was still intact.
An American foreign policy expert who speaks regularly with officials in
Washington and Ankara told me about a working dinner Obama held for Erdoğan
during his May visit. The meal was dominated by the Turks' insistence that
Syria had crossed the red line and their complaints that Obama was reluctant
to do anything about it.
Obama was accompanied by John Kerry and
Tom Donilon, the national security adviser who would soon leave the
job. Erdoğan was joined by Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign
minister, and Hakan Fidan, the head of the MIT.
Fidan is known to be fiercely loyal to Erdoğan,
and has been seen as a consistent backer of the radical rebel opposition in
Syria.
The foreign policy expert told me that the account he heard originated with
Donilon. (It was later corroborated by a former US official, who learned of
it from a senior Turkish diplomat.) According to the expert, Erdoğan had
sought the meeting to demonstrate to Obama that the red line had been
crossed, and had brought Fidan along to state the case.
When Erdoğan tried to draw Fidan into the
conversation, and Fidan began speaking, Obama cut him off and said:
'We know.'
Erdoğan tried to bring Fidan in a second time,
and Obama again cut him off and said:
'We know.'
At that point, an exasperated Erdoğan said,
'But your red line has been crossed!' and,
the expert told me, 'Donilon said Erdoğan "fucking waved his finger at
the president inside the White House".'
Obama then pointed at Fidan and said:
'We know what you're doing with the radicals
in Syria.'
(Donilon, who joined the
Council on Foreign Relations last July, didn't respond to
questions about this story. The Turkish Foreign Ministry didn't respond to
questions about the dinner. A spokesperson for the National Security Council
confirmed that the dinner took place and provided a photograph showing
Obama, Kerry, Donilon, Erdogan, Fidan and Davutoglu sitting at a table.
'Beyond that,' she said, 'I'm not going to read out the details of their
discussions.')
But Erdoğan did not leave empty handed.
Obama was still permitting Turkey to continue to
exploit a loophole in a presidential executive order prohibiting the export
of gold to Iran, part of the US sanctions regime against the country.
In March 2012, responding to sanctions of
Iranian banks by the EU, the SWIFT electronic payment system, which
facilitates cross-border payments, expelled dozens of Iranian financial
institutions, severely restricting the country's ability to conduct
international trade. The US followed with the executive order in July, but
left what came to be known as a 'golden loophole': gold shipments to private
Iranian entities could continue.
Turkey is a major purchaser of Iranian oil and
gas, and it took advantage of the loophole by depositing its energy payments
in Turkish lira in an Iranian account in Turkey; these funds were then used
to purchase Turkish gold for export to confederates in Iran. Gold to the
value of $13 billion reportedly entered Iran in this way between March 2012
and July 2013.
The program quickly became a cash cow for corrupt politicians and traders in
Turkey, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.
'The middlemen did what they always do,' the
former intelligence official said. 'Take 15 per cent. The CIA had
estimated that there was as much as two billion dollars in skim. Gold
and Turkish lira were sticking to fingers.'
The illicit skimming flared into a public 'gas
for gold' scandal in Turkey in December, and resulted in charges against two
dozen people, including prominent businessmen and relatives of government
officials, as well as the resignations of three ministers, one of whom
called for Erdoğan to resign.
The chief executive of a Turkish
state-controlled bank that was in the middle of the scandal insisted that
more than $4.5 million in cash found by police in shoeboxes during a search
of his home was for charitable donations.
Late last year Jonathan Schanzer and Mark Dubowitz reported in
Foreign Policy that the Obama administration closed the golden loophole in
January 2013, but,
'lobbied to make sure the legislation
did
not take effect for six months'.
They speculated that the administration wanted
to use the delay as an incentive to bring Iran to the bargaining table over
its nuclear program, or to placate its Turkish ally in the Syrian civil war.
The delay permitted Iran to,
'accrue billions of dollars more in gold,
further undermining the sanctions regime'.
*
The American decision to end CIA support of the weapons shipments into Syria
left Erdoğan exposed politically and militarily.
'One of the issues at that May summit was
the fact that Turkey is the only avenue to supply the rebels in Syria,'
the former intelligence official said.
'It can't come through Jordan because the
terrain in the south is wide open and the Syrians are all over it. And
it can't come through the valleys and hills of Lebanon - you can't be
sure who you'd meet on the other side.'
Without US military support for the rebels, the
former intelligence official said,
'Erdoğan's dream of having a client state in
Syria is evaporating and he thinks we're the reason why. When Syria wins
the war, he knows the rebels are just as likely to turn on him - where
else can they go? So now he will have thousands of radicals in his
backyard.'
A US intelligence consultant told me that a few
weeks before 21 August he saw a highly classified briefing prepared for
Dempsey and the defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, which described,
'the acute anxiety' of the Erdoğan
administration about the rebels' dwindling prospects.
The analysis warned that the Turkish leadership
had expressed,
'the need to do something that would
precipitate a US military response'.
By late summer, the Syrian army still had the
advantage over the rebels, the former intelligence official said, and only
American air power could turn the tide.
In the autumn, the former intelligence official
went on, the US intelligence analysts who kept working on the events of 21
August,
'sensed that Syria had not done the gas
attack. But the 500 pound gorilla was, how did it happen? The immediate
suspect was the Turks, because they had all the pieces to make it
happen.'
As intercepts and other data related to the 21
August attacks were gathered, the intelligence community saw evidence to
support its suspicions.
'We now know it was a covert action planned
by Erdoğan's people to push Obama over the red line,' the former
intelligence official said.
'They had to escalate to a gas attack in or
near Damascus when the UN inspectors' - who arrived in Damascus on 18
August to investigate the earlier use of gas - 'were there.'
'The deal was to do something spectacular.
Our senior military officers have been told by the DIA and other
intelligence assets that the sarin was supplied through Turkey - that it
could only have gotten there with Turkish support. The Turks also
provided the training in producing the sarin and handling it.'
Much of the support for that assessment came
from the Turks themselves, via intercepted conversations in the immediate
aftermath of the attack.
'Principal evidence came from the Turkish
post-attack joy and back-slapping in numerous intercepts.
Operations are always so super-secret in the
planning but that all flies out the window when it comes to crowing
afterwards. There is no greater vulnerability than in the perpetrators
claiming credit for success.'
Erdoğan's problems in Syria would soon be over:
'Off goes the gas and Obama will say red
line and America is going to attack Syria, or at least that was the
idea. But it did not work out that way.'
The post-attack intelligence on Turkey did not
make its way to the White House.
'Nobody wants to talk about all this,' the
former intelligence official told me.
'There is great reluctance to contradict the
president, although no all-source intelligence community analysis
supported his leap to convict. There has not been one single piece of
additional evidence of Syrian involvement in the sarin attack produced
by the White House since the bombing raid was called off.
My government can't say anything because we
have acted so irresponsibly. And since we blamed Assad, we can't go back
and blame Erdoğan.'
Turkey's willingness to manipulate events in
Syria to its own purposes seemed to be demonstrated late last month, a few
days before a round of local elections, when a recording, allegedly of
Erdoğan and his associates, was posted to YouTube.
It included discussion of a false-flag operation
that would justify an incursion by the Turkish military in Syria.
The operation centered on the tomb of Suleyman
Shah, the grandfather of the revered Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire,
which is near Aleppo and was ceded to Turkey in 1921, when Syria was under
French rule.
One of the Islamist rebel factions was
threatening to destroy the tomb as a site of idolatry, and the Erdoğan
administration was publicly threatening retaliation if harm came to it.
According to a Reuters report of the leaked
conversation, a voice alleged to be Fidan's spoke of creating a provocation:
'Now look, my commander [Erdoğan], if there
is to be justification, the justification is I send four men to the
other side. I get them to fire eight missiles into empty land [in the
