# The Dangers of Idealism - How America Destabilized the Middle East

For
the last 25 years, the U.S. has based its foreign policy
on a sense of primacy and idealism rather than restraint
and realism, says William Ruger, Vice President for
Research and Policy, Charles Koch Foundation.
Ruger asserts that the U.S. failed to recognize the
human and economic cost of international military and
political intervention.
"We've really opened up all kinds of challenges in
this attempt to open up an exemplar for the Middle
East.
We actually have created an exemplar," he
says, "an exemplar of what can go wrong if you
engage in the world without first thinking carefully
about what is necessary for American safety, and
what the unintended consequences of our behavior
could be..."
The
Charles Koch Foundation aims to further understanding of
how US foreign policy affects American people and
societal well-being.
Through grants, events, and collaborative partnerships,
the institute is working to stretch the boundaries of
foreign policy research and debate by discussing ideas
in strategy, trade, and diplomacy that often go unheeded
in the US capital.
