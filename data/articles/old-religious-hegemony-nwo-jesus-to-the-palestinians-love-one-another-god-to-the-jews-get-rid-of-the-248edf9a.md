Hegemony has been described as a form of control
in which the elite achieves dominance over a subordinate population via the
subordinates' consent and acceptance of beliefs rather than by use of force,
(although force can be a handy standby). Once the elite is accepted as the
ruling party, his beliefs, norms and values can then be projected throughout
the subordinate masses creating a consensus of what will be accepted as
normal behavior - all benefiting the elite cream that has risen over the
masses, to the top.
Christianity, the largest organized religion on
Earth, is primarily based on the patriarchal hegemony of Judaism, claiming
God (Yahweh) is masculine, and males are made in "the image and glory of
God," as Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians, Chapter 11.
Hegemony, therefore, is not something newly discovered, but it is one of the
most ancient forms of control by establishing ideas and beliefs within the
masses. Those wishing to maintain the status quo of the elite, (i.e., the
elite) have also long known that the way to protect their status is by
eliminating alternative views as well as silencing rebellious intellectuals
who dare to question the established beliefs.
One of the best known intellectual rebels
questioning everything established and "written," is the mysterious, and
still popular teacher referred to by many as "Jesus."
Approximately 2000 years ago, he was openly practicing civil disobedience
against Judaic law in Palestine as he attempted to set people free from
Judaism and its ongoing, organized, patriarchal hegemony. Striving against
Judaic masculine hegemony, he was elevating the status of women while also
questioning the very identity of the God of Israel, whom he referred to in
the Gospel of John as "a liar, a murder, and the devil." He was urging
people to "go within," and he spoke instead of a different God
of love.
One might wonder how Christianity grew so brutally distant from the original
teachings of love, but in careful reading one finds that Jesus was not the
founder of Christianity.
The apostle Paul, a Jewish man who was never a
disciple of Jesus, was the founder of Christianity. The hegemony that Jesus
sought to end among the Jews, Paul would reestablish among the Gentiles.
Paul's first letters are said to have been written some 20 years after Jesus
was no longer appearing and disappearing in Palestine, and Paul's mission
included a large amount of damage control in the aftermath of the liberation
created by Jesus. Paul, who never met or followed Jesus, traveled throughout
the area establishing patriarchal, organized churches based on Judaic
hegemony. Paul told the crowds who were still eager to hear about Jesus,
that Paul's teachings were the "gospel of Christ," although the earliest
known gospel would not be written for another 20 years.
While the disciples did not clearly understand who or what Jesus actually
was, Paul would take on this task, explaining first and foremost that he was
dead and gone, after having "died for our sins."
Intellectual battles raged as others claimed he
was not a mere mortal, the crucifixion was fiction, and he was something
that could not be fully explained: he simply appeared with no history or
background, never once speaking his own name in the gospels. For those who
argued that he was "fully human," a nativity would be necessary, and so as
the stories were passed from one language into another, he became "the son
of Mary." This, however, might have been based upon another simple
mistranslation.
"Mary," in Aramaic, is a masculine noun meaning
"Lord." (1)
Paul's work completely opposed that of Jesus. Paul warned that people should
"obey the government" because government is established by God, and everyone
who is an authority is a "minister of God," put there by God. (Katherine
Harris apparently referred to this when she said, "God is the one who
chooses our rulers.") Anyone who resists, warned Paul, resists God.
He did not preach liberty, or common sense. He
preached obedience, rules, laws, taxes, qualifications, submission to
authority, the "wrath of God," and he threatened those committing civil
disobedience with "damnation." In complete defiance of the teachings of
Jesus, Paul brought Jewish patriarchy, organized religion and the hegemonic
God of Israel to the Gentiles in the form of Christianity, changing the
message of Jesus from "go within," to "go to church." (2) (3)
Paul did much more than this, however. His efforts and teachings, based upon
the writings of other Jewish men, helped fix into the minds of the Gentile
masses that the God of Israel was the only God in the universe, despite that
God's rather human shortcomings. Paul led people to believe that since his
God was the only God of the universe, this was, of course, the God who had
sent Jesus. Other writings did not support this.
Paul helped fix into the minds of millions the
idea that Jewish writings and teachings were to be taken as the literal Word
of God.
Over one-third of the world's population is Christian, many believing the
above ideas because they were "written in the bible." They believe this
while not considering the other fact, that it was the Jewish people,
themselves, who wrote and edited the bible, creating and recreating the
multiple personalities of
Yahweh based upon personal visions, dreams,
nightmares, ideas, channelings, and ancient stories about the constant
smiting of endless enemies.
A people subscribing to a war God will
ultimately create many warriors.
For nearly 2000 years, a growing percentage of the world has been controlled
by authorities aligning themselves with the war God of Israel. When
Constantine's Church Fathers formally created his "catholic" or universal
Christian church in the 300s, they selected Paul's writings of submission as
the foundation for their desired hegemony. In addition, a vision that
Constantine is said to have had was also woven into this new state religion
as a central theme. He is said to have seen a glowing, inverted sword, its
long blade pointing downward, its crossbars upward, and Constantine was told
that he would conquer with this symbol.
The inverted sword looked much like a crucifix,
and so the cross became the primary symbol for his new church. The ancient
writings stating that there was no crucifixion of Jesus were discarded by
the Church Fathers. (4)
The Old Testament had grown and changed repeatedly throughout its history,
but shortly after Jesus arrived to shake Judaism to its core, the old canon
containing the "Word of God" as channeled, written and edited by men,
abruptly closed with nothing more to be added other than the few selections
about Jesus in the Latin Vulgate of 405 A.D. Humanity's personal, official,
accepted encounters with "God" ended.
There would be no more official encounters with
Gods, God, God Almighty,
LORD God Jehovah,
Yahweh, Jesus, or anyone else not
of this world. We are a people born wired for rich spirituality, and yet the
book of close encounters has been closed for 2000 years.
With nothing new forthcoming according to organized religion, the
subordinate masses have found themselves repeatedly reliving "what has been
written" in the ancient times. In 1948, the Jewish people announced that
according to the "Word of God," God wanted Palestine to be given to the
Jewish people. Knowing that the Christians believed most everything, some
perhaps read Ezekiel, chapter 37, and decided this must be true.
Ezekiel promised that God was going to one day
take the Chosen from among
the goyim, and bring them into their own land,
the "land of Israel," where they will live separately.
Sixty years ago, the Jewish described Palestine as a barren, empty place. It
was, they said, a "Land Without People for a People Without a Land." The
world believed this, and the new "state of Israel" was created within
Palestine, in May, 1948, to help God fulfill "his Word." The Chosen then
wrote the following promise.
The State of Israel:
"will foster the development of the country
for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom,
justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure
complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants
irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of
religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard
the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the
principles of the Charter of the United Nations." (5)
With the world apparently satisfied by this,
Israel then commenced to carry out something quite different from their most
recent written promise. We would later learn that this land was far from
being "barren."
The Holy Land had been cared for and
inhabited by Palestinians since ancient history. To remedy this, it would
now be necessary for the Jewish to become an invading military force in
order to brutally take the land from hundreds of thousands of Palestinian
land owners, and then claim this stolen land as their new Jewish-Only state
as promised by God through the pen of Ezekiel.
The slaughter of the Palestinians "in the name of God" began in 1948 in
order to artificially fulfill a so-called Jewish prophecy. The new
Jewish-Only state would be comprised of hundreds of unconnected country club
neighborhoods scattered like holes punched throughout the otherwise
peaceful, contiguous villages, pastures and orchards of Palestine.
These new Jewish-Only neighborhoods dotting the
Palestinian countryside would be referred to as "settlements," and the
Jewish-Only from all other countries on earth would be invited to come
populate the "settlements," and live, vacation or help kill a few
Palestinians. There has not been a day of peace since God's New Real Estate
Plan was put into action in order to fulfill "The Word of God," by those who
wrote it.
With the God of Israel guiding them, the Chosen have forcefully driven the
Palestinians off their lands using advanced military equipment such as
merkabah (Hebrew word for war chariot) tanks, Caterpillar bulldozers,
warplanes, helicopters, blimps, drones, and navy gunboats, supplied or paid
for by the United States, which, as primarily Christian, also serves the God
of Israel, who in turn serves only the Chosen.
Using this advanced weaponry, God Almighty (we are told) has led his
Chosen
to repeated miraculous victories against the unarmed civilians as troops
have fired up their diesel engines and then rained manmade hellfire down
upon villages and refugee camps. For 60 years they have plowed through
homes, farms, tents, gardens, orchards and groves, sending the Palestinians
running for their lives repeatedly through streets now strewn with Israeli
bombing debris. There have been no promises kept by the Chosen in this new
Promised Land.
The Palestinians are now all refugees in their
own land with no human rights whatsoever, because they are not even
considered human.
The Chosen have uprooted the ancient orchards and olive groves, as well.
They have brought to an end the shortened lives of the people, and ended the
long lives of the ancient olive trees that had been lovingly cared for by
countless generations since Jesus was in the area, teaching love for one's
neighbor. Almost nothing of beauty has been left standing as God's Chosen
army
has gouged and bulldozed their way through Palestine in order to build
God's new, scattered, Holey Land "settlements."
Much of what was previously held to be holy is
now destroyed, including humans, human rights and ancient Holy Sites.
Israeli plans have just been announced for the destruction of a 700-year-old
Mosque, because it was constructed "without a building permit." (6)
The army of the Chosen is now freely executing Palestinian civilians,
including children, in their homes and on their blood-soaked streets without
trials, judge or jury. Many are being kidnapped and imprisoned without
charges, including children. New strategies are also being used in order to
rid the land of its ancestral owners, including starving the refugees
trapped by Israel inside the coveted Gaza Strip, (which contains prime
beachfront property and a possible natural gas field).
Those who have written that they are the Chosen
of God are now withholding water, medical supplies, and electricity from the
1.5 million people trapped in Gaza, and they speak of further plans to
launch more deadly military offenses on this tortured population. They are
making the refugees as miserable as possible in ongoing attempts to drive
them off this land, because a Jewish person "has written in the bible" that
this land was given to the Chosen by God.
The Chosen of God have acted in a less-than-civilized manner during their
rampages on God's behalf. When the Chosen army besieged the Palestinian
Ministry of Culture building and lived in it for approximately one month,
they left their bodily wastes throughout the newly built, eight-story
building, despite the fact that there were two toilet facilities on each
floor. Instead of using the facilities, they chose to urinate and defecate
in the rooms, in drawers pulled out of desks, in flower pots, in bottles, on
the photocopier, on films, on children's books and on documents.
More recently, the Chosen living in "settlement"
neighborhoods have been doing something similar. Many of the "settlements"
have been built upon Palestine's formerly beautiful, lofty, now-stolen
hilltops. The advantage of being uphill is that the Chosen can funnel their
raw sewage downhill onto the Palestinian lands below, thus delivering a
clever two-fold message from their God. (7) (8)
Like obedient, uneducated serfs in the Dark Ages, we have continued to
believe everything that we have been conditioned to believe. We have
believed everything the Chosen have written on paper or parchment.
The
question that now should be asked is, how many other outright lies,
inventions and broken promises have the Chosen given to the world while
demanding silence, acceptance, and complete unquestioning belief?
We have believed all of the inventions created about a "God," who is
apparently now leading merkabah attacks in the land known since Genesis as
Palestine. We have believed, while failing to see organized religion and
monotheism for what they are: the earliest form of mass control by the
shaping of people's beliefs. With true spirituality extinguished in exchange
for a state-controlled religion, the few elite are elevated "by God," to
rule over the obedient, submissive masses.
At this time in our unending Dark Age, the
masses are being further silenced by new laws forbidding people from even
questioning the Chosen. Questioning can now result in prison sentences.
It was a deliberate act of control for the Church Fathers to artificially
join the teachings of Jesus with those of Paul and Paul's Jewish God of
Israel. Jesus showed no allegiance to the God of Israel. It remains a
mistake to try to claim that Jesus and Yahweh are on the same side of moral
and civil conduct and decency and have led people in similar acts of love
and tolerance when clearly this is not true. The tragedy of Jesus was not
that he was affixed to a tree, but that he was affixed to the God of Israel.
When did the writings of man become "The Word of God," and whose agenda does
this serve? How much truth about Divinity has been kept from us?
The hegemonic tools of propaganda are now quite
advanced and projecting the desires of the elite into our minds like never
before through controlled media, invented news, advertising/ psychology
campaigns, state-mandated education, "advanced" education instilling more
required beliefs, all entertainment, and the outrageous posting of the Ten
Commandments in public areas, demanding loyalty to the God of Israel, all to
guard the elite status.
How much longer will we allow this growing
hegemony now creeping over the world to keep the world confined to the Dark
Ages, completely controlled by
the elite few?
In 2006, the long-lost
Gospel of Judas was translated into English by a team
working with The National Geographic Society. This is another piece
of ancient writing that was deliberately kept from the masses for the better
part of 2000 years, because it challenges monotheism rather profoundly.
While man has relied upon the mistranslated bible as a prophetic Word of
God and has "helped God" bring about what other men have written as
prophecy, the Gospel of Judas stands alone as one of the most prophetic,
unadulterated writings perhaps ever found. Its prophecies were fulfilled
without artificial help.
It was translated and it came to us after its
prophecies had already been fulfilled and were standing in plain sight for
all to see. (9)
In this ancient, short gospel, one finds that Jesus was appearing and
disappearing before the disciples, fully flesh and blood, using various
identities indicating he was much more than a "simple carpenter" as others
claimed. (Claims of his appearances as a human, using different identities
continue around the world today, but the elite-controlled news does not
report this.)
This ancient gospel contained the prophecy that
many horrifying crimes would one day be openly committed by those professing
to be followers and priests of Jesus, including sexual crimes, homosexual
acts, the sacrifice of children, and slaughter. People would be led astray
by priests and treated as cattle, it is stated, because the priests were
serving and following the wrong God.
According to this gospel, Judas would be forever falsely accused until the
time dawned when a certain generation of people finally grasps the truth
about organized religion and the lie of hegemonic monotheism, and breaks
away from it. It is that generation, according to this gospel, that is
called holy and great, because they will bring an end to the Age of Darkness
and see the truth that Judas, alone, first saw and understood: Judas was the
only disciple who recognized the true identity of Jesus.
Judas, alone, realized that Jesus had not been
sent by the God of Israel: Jesus had been sent from a God of love who was
light years above and beyond the war God of Israel.
