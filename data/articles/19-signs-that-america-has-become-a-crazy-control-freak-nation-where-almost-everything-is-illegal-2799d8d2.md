Do you think that you are free?
Most Americans would still probably answer "yes"
to that question, but is that really the case?
In the film Edge of Darkness, Mel Gibson stated that "everything is illegal
in Massachusetts". Well, the same could pretty much be said for the United
States as a whole.
Our lives are governed by millions of laws, rules and regulations and more
are being piled on all the time. In fact,
40,000 new laws just went into
effect in January.
Every single new law restricts your freedom just a little bit more. The
truth is that America has become a crazy control freak nation where
virtually everything that we do is highly regulated. You have probably
broken multiple laws today that you don't even know exist.
We have all become criminals and lawbreakers because almost everything is
illegal at this point.
Our politicians are convinced that they are
"making life better" by piling gigantic mountains of laws onto our backs,
and law enforcement authorities are convinced that they are helping society
by "cracking down on crime", but the reality is that our liberties and our
freedoms are being strangled by all of this government oppression.
This is
not the way that America is supposed to work.
Yes, every society needs laws. But the laws should be short enough and
simple enough that everybody can read them and understand them.
In America today, there is no possible way that any of us could ever read
all of the laws that apply to us. Most of us just live our daily lives and
try to do the "right" thing. But there is no guarantee that men with guns
will not show up at your door one evening because of some obscure regulation
that you have broken.
The following are 19 signs that America has become a crazy control freak
nation where almost everything is illegal.
-
One California town is actually
considering making it illegal to smoke
in your own backyard.
-
In Louisiana, a church was recently
ordered
to stop giving out water because it did not have a permit to do
so.
-
In the United States it is illegal to
operate a train that does not have an "F"
painted on the front. Apparently without that "F" we all might
not know where the front of the train is.
-
In many U.S. states is it now illegal
to collect rain that falls from the sky on to your own property.
-
In America today it is illegal to milk
your cow and sell the milk
to your neighbor. If you do this, there is a good chance that
federal agents will raid your home at the crack of dawn.
-
In Washington D.C.
it is illegal not to recycle cat litter.
-
It is illegal to give a tour of the
monuments in Washington D.C.
without a license.
-
In the United States it is illegal to
sell
natural cures for cancer - even if they work.
-
In the state of Massachusetts it is
illegal
to deface a milk carton.
-
In the state of Alabama,
bear wrestling is completely illegal.
-
In Fairbanks, Alaska it is illegal to
give alcoholic beverages
to a moose.
-
In Lake Elmo, Minnesota it is illegal to
sell pumpkins or Christmas trees that are grown
outside city limits.
-
There is a federal law that makes it
illegal to be "annoying"
on the Internet.
-
If you register with a false name on
MySpace or Facebook you could potentially "spend
five years in federal prison".
-
In Hazelwood, Missouri it is illegal for
little girls
to sell girl scout cookies in the front yards of their own
homes.
-
All over the United States
lemonade stands run by children are being shut down because they
do not have the proper permits.
-
In Florida, it is illegal to bring
a plastic butter knife to school.
-
In San Juan Capistrano, California it is
illegal to hold a home Bible study without a "conditional
use permit".
-
In the city of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania it is illegal to make even a single dollar from a blog
unless you buy a
$300 business license.
Sadly, this list of crazy laws and ridiculous
regulations could be thousands long.
We are a nation run by a bunch of control freaks who do not care about our
liberties and our freedoms.
Every once in a while, John Stossel does some really great reporting. An
example of this is posted below. In this 40-minute video, Stossel goes into
great detail about how almost everything is illegal in America today. In
particular, the first 20 minutes are absolutely excellent.

This Stossel special will
blow your mind!
The government, especially
the EPA is out of
control as well as local prosecutors trying to make a
name for themselves.
