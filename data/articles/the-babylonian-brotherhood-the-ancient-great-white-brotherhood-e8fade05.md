As the flood waters receded after the Venus cataclysm the survivors
came down from the mountains and up from within the Earth. They
settled on the lowlands and plains and began to rebuild. This was
when Sumer, Egypt and the civilization in the Indus Valley suddenly
appeared at a very high level of technological advancement, although
they had existed before and were now restored after the upheavals.
The Sumerian society began at the peak of its development because of
this sudden infusion of knowledge and the white Aryan race,
originally from Mars, expanded out from the Caucasus Mountains and
the Near East down into Sumer, Egypt and the Indus Valley where, as
even conventional history agrees, highly advanced societies
spontaneously emerged. However within this white race, and others
also, was a genetic stream I will call reptile-Aryan or
reptile-human. Whenever I use the term Aryan I am referring to the
white race.
These were the crossbreed bloodlines created from the
genetic manipulation of
the Anunnaki. The major centre for the
reptile-Aryan bloodlines, in the ancient world after the flood
waters receded, was Babylon in the south of the Sumer region
alongside the River Euphrates. A closer look at the evidence appears
to date the foundation of Babylon far earlier than previously
believed and it was one of the first cities of the post-flood era.
It was here that the mystery schools and secret societies were
formed which were to span the globe in the thousands of years that
followed.
The Brotherhood which controls the world today is the
modern expression of the Babylonian Brotherhood of
reptile-Aryan priests and royalty which came together there after the flood. It
was in Babylon in this post-flood period from around 6,000 years ago
that the foundation beliefs - manipulated beliefs - of todays world
religions were established to control and rule the people.
The founder of Babylon according to ancient texts and legend was
Nimrod who
reigned with his wife, Queen Semiramis. Nimrod was described as a
mighty tyrant and
one of the giants. The Arabs believed that after the flood it was
Nimrod who built or
rebuilt the amazing structure at
Baalbek in the Lebanon with its
three stones weighing
800 tons each. It was said that he ruled the region that is now
Lebanon and, according
to Genesis, the first centres of Nimrods kingdom were Babylon,
Akkad and others in
the land of Shinar (Sumer).
Later he expanded further into Assyria
to build cities like
Nineveh where many of the Sumerian Tablets were found. Nimrod and
Semiramis (or
the beings those names symbolized) were from the reptile bloodlines
which also became
known as Titans, the genetic streams of the reptile-possessed humans
and the full blood
reptilians. This race of giants or Titans was said to have been
descendants of Noah, the baby described in the Book of Enoch
(previously the Book of Noah) as being a Watcher-human hybrid with
extremely white skin.
The father of Nimrod in the text of Genesis
was Cush, also known as Bel or Belus, who was the grandson of Noah
and son of Ham. Cush became known as the deity, Hermes, which means
Son of Ham. Ham or Khem means the burnt one and may have been
connected to Sun worship.
A great network of deities emerged from
Babylon and its connections with Egypt.
Nimrod and Semiramis have remained the key deities of the
Brotherhood to this day under many different names and symbols.
Nimrod was symbolized as a fish and Queen Semiramis as a
fish and a
dove. Semiramis is likely to be symbolic of Ninkharsag, the creator
of the reptile-human crossbreeds. Nimrod was the fish-god Dagon who
was depicted as half man, half fish.
It is possible that this was
symbolic of him being half human, half scaled reptile.
Queen Semiramis was also symbolized as a fish because the Babylonians
believed fish to be an aphrodisiac and it became the symbol for the
Goddess of Love.
Hence
the use of the fish in Christian symbolism
and architecture. In her role as the Holy Spirit, Semiramis was
pictured as a dove holding an olive branch and Semiramis means
branch bearer as in Ze (the) emir (branch) and amit
(bearer). Note also the symbolism of this in the story of Noah and
the Great Flood, when the dove came back bearing an olive branch.
The return of the reptilians after the flood?
The name, Semiramis,
was evolved from the earlier Indian deity, Sami-Rama-isi or
Semi-ramis. A fish and a dove are two symbols still widely used in
religious ritual and national ceremony, although most of the people
involved have no idea of the true meaning. Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Northern Ireland terrorist group the IRA, has a dove as
its symbol and you find the dove on many of the sceptres held by the
British monarch (see
picture section).
Both organizations are modern
fronts for the Babylonian Brotherhood and the doves symbolize Queen
Semiramis. The dove to them is not a symbol of peace, but of
death
and destruction because of the reverse symbolism the Brotherhood
employs. If it is positive to the masses, it is negative to the
Brotherhood, and this allows their negative symbols to be placed
throughout the public arena. No-one complains because they have no
idea what these symbols, like the dove, really represent.
Semiramis was called the Queen of Heaven (also Rhea), the Virgin
Mother of the Gods,
and sometimes known as the Great Earth Mother (Ninkharsag). She was
also worshipped
under the name Astarte the woman who made towers and this could
refer to the Tower of
Babel (Babylon) which Nimrod is said to have built. The bloodlines
of European royalty
came from the reptile-Aryan bloodlines of Babylon and the crown
evolved from the
horned headgear worn by Nimrod.
The horns symbolized the monarchs
authority and later
became a metal headband with three horns symbolizing royal power
with divine authority7
This is represented by the symbol of the fleur-de-lis which you find
throughout the regalia
of modern royalty (see Figure 6 below).
As I have mentioned
already, the Draco royal
hierarchy, the winged albino whites, are said to have horns and Im
sure this is the true origin of the horned headgear of ancient
royalty.
Figure 6:
The Fleur-de-lis, symbol
of the Babylonian trinity of Nimrod,
Queen Semiramis and Tammuz,
among other things.
The classic depiction of the Devil also
has Draco-like horns. Nimrod was given the title Baal (the
Lord) and Semiramis was Baalti (My Lady). The Latin
term for my lady is Mea Domina which in its corrupted
Italian form became Madonna.8 Nimrod was represented in
a dual role of God the Father and Ninus, the son of
Semiramis, and her olive branch was symbolic of this
offspring produced through a virgin birth. Ninus was also
known as Tammuz who was said to have been crucified
with a lamb at his feet and placed in a cave.
When a rock
was rolled away from the caves entrance three days later,
his body had disappeared. Heard that somewhere before?
This husband-wife-son theme of Nimrod-Semiramis-and
Ninus/Tammuz became the Osiris-Isis-Horus mythology
of the Egyptians with its equivalent in India, Asia, China and
elsewhere. Much later it would be Joseph, Mary and Jesus.
When the
Babylonians held their Spring rites to mark the death and
resurrection after three days of Tammuz-Ninus, they offered buns
inscribed with a solar cross. Yes, even the hot cross buns of
British Easter tradition come from Babylon.
Easter comes from
another face of Queen Semiramis - Ishtar -and it is from this, and
possibly another Brotherhood deity, Ashtaroth, that we get the name
of Ashtar as in Ashtar Command , a completely manipulated New Age
belief in an extraterrestrial hero who has come to save us.
The
Babylonian myths and symbolism provided the foundations for all the
major religions, especially Christianity. The Roman Church was the
creation of the Babylonian Brotherhood and the Pope still wears a mitre shaped like a fish head to
symbolize Nimrod. This is also the
significance of his Fishermans Ring.
The Chair of St Peter in the
Vatican was claimed to be a holy relic, but in 1968 it was exposed
by a scientific commission as being no older than the 9th century
More significantly, according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia, is that
it is decorated by twelve plates portraying the twelve labours of
Hercules. This same work claims that Hercules was another name for
Nimrod before becoming a deity of the Greeks.
In 1825, Pope Leo XII
authorized the production of a jubilee medal and it depicted a woman
in a pose that was blatant symbolism of Queen Semiramis.
She had a
crucifix in her left hand, a cup in her right and on her head was a
seven rayed crown like the one on the Statue of Liberty, another
depiction of Semiramis which was given to New York by French
Freemasons. A contact who has relatives working in high positions in
the Vatican told me how, during the reign of Pope John Paul II, he
was given a guided tour of the place which blew his mind.
He was
shown the Popes solid gold bath which is decorated with all the
astrological symbols and he saw inside the vacuum-sealed vaults
which contain thousands of ancient esoteric books which have been
stolen and hoarded over hundreds of years of religious dictatorship
and so taken out of public circulation.
The Roman Church and the
Babylonian Brotherhood are one and the same.
Nimrod was also Eannus, the god with two faces, who was later known
to the Romans as Janus. One of the Anunnaki brothers, Enki the serpent
god, was also
known as Ea. The Freemasonic eagle with two heads looking left and
right, east and west, is symbolic of Nimrod in the role of Eannus,
and I would suggest that the eagle is symbolic of the winged Draco.
Eannus, it was said, held the keys to the doors of heaven and he was
the sole intermediary between God and humanity, therefore any belief
not supported by him was false and should be condemned.
This was a
wonderful tool for the Babylonian priesthood to impose their will on
the populous and exactly the same scam has been played by their
successors, the Christian priests, the Rabbis and the priesthoods of
Islam, Hinduism and all the rest. The Roman Catholic title of
cardinal comes from the word cardo meaning hinge and relates to
Nimrods role as guardian of the door to heaven.10 The Babylonian
priests even established a governing body they called the Grand
Council of Pontiffs, a name later transferred to the Church of
Rome.
The Babylonian High Priest, who instructed the inner circle
initiates, was known as... Peter, meaning the Great Interpreter.
The feast day of the Christian St Peter was traditionally celebrated
on the day the Sun entered the astrological house of Aquarius, the
very day that Eannus and Janus were honoured!
The Babylonian
religion, like all the look-alikes that were to follow, consisted of
two levels.
The masses were manipulated into believing superstitions
and into taking symbolic stories literally, while the chosen
initiates were given the real knowledge on penalty of death if they
ever revealed it. In this way the truth about life, human potential,
history and the reptilian Agenda, were lost to the population and
kept only for the few.
Human sacrifice was fundamental to the religion of Babylon and
wherever the Babylonian Brotherhood and their reptilian bloodlines
have traveled, human sacrifice has always gone with them because
the reptilians demand these rituals. The malevolent ones seem to be
addicted to blood and this has been passed on to their crossbreeds
as the evidence I shall present will show. The Babylonian priests
were required to eat some of their sacrificial offerings and so the
word for priest, Cahna-Bal, became the term for eating human flesh,
cannibal.
Moloch, the name of that flying lizard I mentioned
earlier, was another name for Nimrod-Tammuz.
Tam means to perfect
and muz means to burn. You can see the symbolism of Tammuz-Moloch,
therefore, in the rituals of burning children alive in honor of
this deity
which, staggeringly, still go on today. The
Beltane
ritual later performed in Britain by the Druids on May 1st, May Day,
involved the burning of children in the belly of a huge wicker
effigy of a man. This was inherited from the Babylonians when the
Brotherhood expanded across Europe. Indeed it may well be that the
reptilians had once based themselves in what is now the United
Kingdom and Ireland before they moved their main focus to the Near
East and Africa.
The Feast of Tammuz was on June 23rd and celebrated his ascension
from the
underworld. When he was resurrected, Tammuz was known as Oannes, the
fish god,
and Oannes is a version of the name, John.
For this reason, John
has been used as a
symbol for Tammuz-Nimrod in symbolic characters like John the
Baptist. June 23rd, the
Feast of Tammuz, became the Christian day called St Johns Eve!
The
Nimrod-Semiramis combination has been depicted under countless names in the
civilizations
and cultures which have followed.
These deities throughout the world
may seem to be
an unfathomable tidal wave of names, but they are overwhelmingly
different names for
the same two figures. Another deity widely used in Satanism for the
sacrifice of
children today is Kronos, the king of the Cyclops in Greek legend.
He was known as
the tower builder and is almost certainly another version of Nimrod,
the builder of the
biblical Tower of Babel.
The reason the reptile bloodlines are involved in such unspeakable
ritual and practice today, is quite simply because they always have
been. When you follow these bloodlines across history, you find they
use the same rituals and sacrifice to the same deities, right to the
present day.
Another passage in
the Book of Enoch tells of
the
Watchers breeding with human women and the behavior of the
offspring they produced:
And they became pregnant, and they bore great giants... who
consumed all the
acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the
giants turned
against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against
birds and beasts, and
reptiles, and fish, and to devour one anothers flesh and drink
blood. The Earth laid
accusation against the lawless ones.
That passage describes the bloodlines I am highlighting and they
came together in the Babylonian Brotherhood which has since expanded
across the planet. While we look out of our eyes and feel part of
this physical world, the reptiles look into this third dimension,
much like someone looking through a window. In this case, the eyes
of the physical body. We are consciously in the third dimension,
they are consciously in the fourth looking into the third. When you
know what you are looking for it is the eyes that give them away.
They are dark, piercing and cold. The reptile full-bloods are not
attached to their bodies like humans. They are knowingly using them
as space suits to operate in this world, and when one wears out
they simply occupy another. It is from this process of possession
by the reptilians and other low vibrational entities that we have
the ancient tales, indeed modern ones too, of demons, devils and
evil spirits taking over a human mind and body.
It is the reptilians
and other consciousness of the lower fourth dimension, the cesspit
vibration as I call it, which are summoned during Satanic, black
magic rituals and it is during these rituals that many unsuspecting
puppets are plugged in to the reptilian consciousness and taken
over. So it was in Babylon and so it is today.
As I revealed in I Am
Me I Am Free, and will elaborate upon in this book, the Brotherhood
hierarchy today are seriously into Satanic ritual, child sacrifice,
blood drinking and other abominations that would take your breath
away. Yes, I am talking about some of the biggest royal, political,
business, banking and media names on the planet.
People like Henry
Kissinger,
George Bush, the
British royal family and many other
presidents, prime ministers and members of royalty. Fantastic? Of
course it is, but since when did the truth not sound fantastic in a
world of such denial and illusion?
Three of the principle elements of the Babylonian religion were
fire, serpents and the
Sun. I should explain their focus on the Sun because it is a vital
part of the story. Most
of the global population worshipped the Sun for its obvious gifts of
heat and light and the effect this had on their crops and
well-being. However, within the hierarchy of the Babylon Brotherhood
and other Elite groups which had the advanced knowledge, they
focused on the Sun for other reasons too. They understood the true
nature of the Sun as a multidimensional consciousness which extends
across the solar system on unseen frequency levels.
Even in this
physical dimension, the Suns emissions of magnetic energy are
constantly affecting us second by second. The Sun has a diameter of
some 864,000 miles and contains 99% of the matter in the Solar
System.17 It is an immense ball of energy which works very much like
an atomic bomb and the internal temperature can reach as much as 14
million degrees centigrade.
It rotates faster at the equator than
at the poles and therefore the activity and stimulation of the Suns
magnetic field is simply colossal. The writer and researcher Maurice Cotterell has made a long and detailed study of sunspot and solar
flare activity when
the Sun is projecting immensely powerful
magnetic energy.
This has been photographed as gigantic loops of
fire, some 100,000 miles high.19 This energy travels to the Earth on
the solar wind and it can affect computer systems and cause power
blackouts. But for the Van Allen Belts, the zones of radiation which
surround the planet and connect with the Earths magnetic field, the
Suns energy would fry us.
Maurice Cotterell studied the sunspot cycles and established short,
long and great cycles of solar activity, as he explains in his book
with Adrian G. Gilbert called The Mayan Prophecies.
When Cotterells research was already advanced, he came across the
amazing mathematical system of numbers and symbols left by the
ancient Maya people in Central America. The Maya claimed to have
originated with the gods and recognized a lost island as their
former home. Their astonishingly accurate mathematical and
astronomical systems, and their measurement of time, were inherited
from much older cultures and ultimately from the extraterrestrials.
We have already seen that Mexican President
Miguel De La Madrid
claimed that the Mayans were interbred with the reptilians, the
iguana race as he put it.
Maurice Cotterell was fascinated to realize that the Mayan cycles of
human evolution corresponded remarkably with his sunspot cycles of
magnetic emissions. Even over thousands of years, they were
incredibly close. This is perfectly explainable. Everything is
energy. Life is the interaction of magnetic vibrational fields.
Change the magnetism and you change the nature of the energy field.
Change the
energy field and you change the nature of mental, emotional,
spiritual and physical
life, all of which are energy in different forms. The other planets
do this as they circle
the Sun and affect the magnetic field of the Earth: we call this astrology. Cotterell
believes that we are effected by these fields most powerfully at the
time we are
conceived rather than the time we are born, a point which has much
validity. I feel that
both powerfully affect us.
His research established that sunspot
activity corresponds
with the human fertility cycles and with the emergence and demise of
great civilizations and empires. Scientists have also discovered that
humans have an internal
clock which is in sync with the Sun. In short, the Suns effect on
human life is
fundamental and far beyond its obvious contribution of warmth and
light. The
extraterrestrials knew this in these ancient times and the Sun was
viewed with awe. It is the physical and spiritual heart of the solar
system and it came to symbolize the creator, particularly the male
aspects of the creative force... He Who Is The Light Of The World.
This knowledge of the Sun will be a common theme throughout the rest
of this book as we journey through history to the present day. It
does, however, make the decoding of history a little more complex
because the ancients would constantly use Sun and astrological
symbolism in their stories and some of the names for their gods
would be used to symbolize the Sun and the planets. Working out what
is literal and what is symbolic is a considerable challenge. I also
think that the term Sun god has been used to symbolize the
extraterrestrials and their crossbreeds, who were said in the
ancient texts to have faces which shone like the Sun - the Shining
Ones.
Imagine the power you would have to advance an Agenda and
manipulate the human race if you knew the cycles of energy from the
Sun and other planets and how they were likely to affect human
consciousness. You would know when people would be more prone to
anger, aggression, fear, doubt and guilt, and therefore when to have
your wars, economic collapses and so on. The Brotherhood have always
had this knowledge and they use it to great effect today as I shall
document.
The Babylonian Brotherhood and its reptilian bloodlines expanded
across the Middle and Near East, especially to Egypt, and eventually
into Europe and the Americas. I think the early Egyptian
civilization after the Venus upheavels was the work of the Aryans
from Mars, the Phoenicians, with or without the reptilian Anunnaki.
But before 2,000 BC the reptilians were taking over. The Royal Court
of the Dragon was founded by the priests of Mendes in around 2,200
BC and this still exists today as the Imperial and
Royal Court of
the Dragon Sovereignty.
The author,
Laurence Gardner, is the present
Chancellor of the Imperial Court of Dragon Sovereignty and his
postal address in Devon, England is at Colomba House.
Columba = dove
= Queen Semiramis.
According to Gardner, the name Dracula means Son
of Dracul and was inspired by Prince Vlad III of
Transylvania-Wallachia, a Chancellor of the Court of the Dragon in
the 15th century. The princes father was called Dracul within the
Court.
Dracul = Draco.
Wherever they went, the Babylonian
Brotherhood created their own mystery schools to manipulate the
population into believing a nonsense and into giving away their
power through superstition and fear. At the same time the higher
levels of these pyramid structures communicated the advanced
knowledge to those who would serve the reptilian Agenda. Where other
non-reptilian initiation schools existed, they were infiltrated and
taken over by the Babylonian priesthood.
Mystery schools have been
around for tens of thousands of years, probably hundreds of
thousands, and they are used to pass on advanced knowledge to those
the hierarchy and priests decide are worthy enough. In his book, The
Masters Of Wisdom, J. G.
Bennett writes of how the Russian mystic, Gregori Gurdjieff,
told him that the mystery schools went back at least 30,000 to
40,000 years. Gurdjieff said
he had learned this from
cave drawings in the Caucasus Mountains and Turkestan (that area
again).
I often hear
New Age people scream with indignation at the thought that the
ancient mystery schools
were part of the manipulation. Well, first of all there should be no
structures, whatever
their intent, that deny knowledge to people. I dont care what their
intent may be, once you consider it your right to deny knowledge and
decide who should and should not have access to it, you are playing
a very dangerous and arrogant game.
There were those of positive
intent who wanted to use the mystery schools to give the knowledge
to people they believed would use it wisely and I am not suggesting
that all these schools were malevolent, certainly not. But even the
positive ones were eventually infiltrated by the servants of the
reptilians.
As Manly P. Hall, the Freemasonic historian, wrote:
While the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not
necessarily evil, there arose from its perversion several false
schools of sorcery, or black magic, (In Egypt)... the black
magicians of Atlantis continued to exercise their superhuman powers
until they had completely undermined and corrupted the morals of the
primitive Mysteries... they usurped the position formerly occupied
by the initiates, and seized the reins of spiritual government.
Thus black magic dictated the state religion and
paralyzed the
intellectual and spiritual
activities of the individual by demanding his complete and
unhesitating acquiescence in
the dogma formulated by the priestcraft. The Pharaoh became a puppet
in the hands of
the Scarlet Council - a committee of arch-sorcerers elevated to
power by the priesthood.
The black magicians that Hall says were formerly in Atlantis were,
for me, the reptilian-human hybrids of what I call the Babylonian
Brotherhood. It is their secret society network that now spans the
globe and operates in literally every country. It allows the
coordination of the Agenda across national borders and between
apparently unconnected companies and institutions like politics,
banking, business, the military and the media.
Knowledge is not good
nor bad, it just is. It is how we use that knowledge that is
positive or negative. At the upper levels of this network they know
of the true power of the Sun, magnetics and the mind; the effect of
the planets on human behavior; how to manipulate time,
consciousness, energy, the weather and so much more. If used
malevolently, this knowledge can be incredibly destructive and
manipulating and this is what has happened.
At the same time the
reptilians have used their secret societies to create institutions
in the public arena such as religions and political parties to suck
this advanced knowledge out of circulation. The Inquisition was a
wonderful example of this technique. Merely to speak about esoteric
matters was to sign your own death warrant. This scam has been so
effective that still today you have Christians condemning esoteric
information as the Devil when this same knowledge is the very
foundation of their religion. If you want to know where Christianity
really came from, stick around. It is recycled Paganism and provably
so.
Yet Christianity has been used quite brilliantly as the major
vehicle for removing vital
knowledge from the public domain. Whenever Christianity and other
religions took
control of a country or region, the ancient texts and records were
removed or destroyed.
This took out of circulation the very knowledge the reptilians have
used
and still use to manipulate an ignorant population. It was also in
the name of Christianity that most of the accounts of the true
history of humankind have been destroyed, along with knowledge of
the influence on human affairs of extraterrestrial races, positive
and negative. This allowed an alternative invented history to be
written which has delinked humanity from its origins. Controlling
history is so important because if you manipulate how people see
what we call the past, you will influence massively how they see the
present.
The themes I have highlighted so far, along with the deities and
symbols, will travel
with us from here to the present day as we follow the expansion of
the Babylonian
Brotherhood across the world. Invariably, the Babylon reptilian
full-bloods and hybrids
manipulated themselves into the positions of power and influence in
the countries
where they settled.
They had a much higher level of knowledge than
most of the people
and, as vehicles for the fourth dimensional reptilians, there was
already a long term plan
to work to, the Great Work of Ages as it became known to
the
Freemasons.
They
allowed the non-reptilian population to do the work and then, when
new societies were
established, the Brotherhood priests and initiates would hijack the
positions of religious
and political power and ensure that any advanced knowledge in
circulation was sucked
out of the public domain and into their mystery schools and
secret
societies.
The white
race and the reptile-Aryan crossbreeds had emerged from the Caucasus
Mountains and
the mountains of Iran and Kurdistan after the flood to settle in
Egypt, Israel/Palestine
and what we now call Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey, going up
to the Caucasus
Mountains (see Figure 7).
Figure 7:
The Land of the
Gods in the
ancient world
from where the
Aryan and
reptile-Aryan
bloodstreams
emerged in the
Caucasus
Mountains,
Sumer; Babylon,
and Egypt.
There were
other advanced
peoples in other
parts of the
world, however,
not only here.
Significantly it was from this same region
that all the worlds major religions emerged and this is no
accident. In earlier times, the civilizations of Sumer, Babylon and
Assyria were in the general area of what we call Iraq, while Turkey
was previously known as Asia Minor and Persia.
Richard Laurence, the
Archbishop of Cashel, who translated the first English edition of
the Book of Enoch from the Ethiopian, established from the
descriptions of the longest day of the year, that the author of the
text had to have lived in the Caucasus region and not Palestine, as
most people believed.23
This was where the main reptile-human
bloodlines emerged from and the original text of the Book of Enoch
was the much older Book of Noah, the reptilian crossbreed. The Aryan
race as it expanded into new territory was known under various
names, the most significant of which were the Hittites and
Phoenicians.
I think there were definitely other Aryan settlements
outside this region, possibly Britain among them, and certainly the
reptilians were operating in other parts of the world, like the
Americas. But this mountainous region around the Caucasus and down
to the plains of Sumer and Egypt is a key to the true history of
humankind over the last seven thousand years.
The Caucasus Mountains came up again and again in my research and
how appropriate
that in North America white people are known as Caucasian. Even
according to official
history it was a white Aryan race from the Caucasus Mountains
region which moved
into the Indus Valley of India about 1550 BC and created what is
today known as the
Hindu religion. It was this same Aryan race (they called themselves
Arya) which
introduced the ancient Sanskrit language to India and the stories
and myths contained in
the Hindu holy books, the Vedas.
L. A. Waddell, in his outstanding
research into this
Aryan race, established that the father of the first historical
Aryan king of India (recorded
in the Maha-Barata epic and Indian Buddhist history) was the last
historical king of the
Hittites in Asia Minor. The Indian Aryans worshipped the Sun as
the Father-god Indra,
and the Hittite-Phoenicians called their Father-god Bel by the name,
Indara.
Under
many names this same Aryan people also settled in Sumer, Babylon,
Egypt and Asia
Minor, now Turkey, and other Near Eastern countries, taking with
them the same stories,
myths, and religion. This is why, as we shall see in detail later,
all the major religions tell
the same tale but using different names.
They all come from the same
source, this Aryan
race, which seems to have originated on Mars, and the reptile-human
bloodlines operating
covertly within them. What we call the Jewish race also originated
in the Caucasus region
and not, as claimed, in Israel. Jewish historical and
anthropological sources have shown
that only a few of the people known as Jewish have any genetic
connection to Israel.
In
the 8th century a people called
the Khazars living in the Caucasus
Mountains and
southern Russia had a mass conversion to the Jewish religion. Later
when that empire
folded, these same people made their way north over a long period of
time to settle in
other parts of Russia, Lithuania and Estonia.
From there they
entered Western Europe and
eventually the United States.
The Rothschild family is one of these
bloodlines. These are
the same people who justified the takeover of Arab Palestine after
the last war by saying
that God had given them an ancient right to that land as his
chosen people. In truth
their original homeland is the Caucasus region and southern Russia,
not Israel.
See ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free for a detailed
and sourced account of this story and the secret society
manipulation that was behind the creation of Israel, or Rothschildland as it really is.
Figure 8:
The Aryans and the reptile-Aryans expanded by sea and land
into Europe under many names,
and especially thanks to the British
Empire, they would eventually take over the wodd.
The white race expanded northwards into Europe. The first people
went by sea under
the name, the Phoenicians, and over many centuries others migrated
over land (see
Figure 8).
Two of the latter groups were called the Cimmerians and
the Scythians and
through a series of name changes these same bloodlines populated
Europe and
reconnected with the earlier Aryan settlers of Britain and Northern
Europe who had
been installed by the seafaring Phoenicians. The Phoenicians are
crucial to the story and
I will come to them in detail in a moment.
The Cimmerians migrated
north west from
the Caucasus and Asia Minor (Turkey) into the countries we now call
Belgium, the
Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. The Roman historians, Pliny and
Tacitus, said that
all the people along the coast from the Netherlands to Denmark were
the same ethnic group and this is supported by archaeological evidence which
indicates that this people
arrived in that region about 300 to 250 BC. Another group of
Cimmerians traveled up
the River Danube through Hungary and Austria into southern Germany
and France. The
Romans called them Gauls and the Greeks knew them as the Keltoi or
Celts.
Groups of
these Celtic tribes also settled in Bohemia and Bavaria and others
invaded northern
Italy. Sallust, the Roman historian, records how Romans were
defeated a number of
times by the Cimbri, who he says were Gauls. Other Roman
historians say the Cimbri were Celts. They were divided into three
tribes, the Belgae (north east France), the Gauls (central France)
and the Acquitanae (southern France to the Pyrenees Mountains).
By
the second century BC, the Gauls/Celts (the white Cimmerians from
the Caucasus Mountains and the Middle East) occupied all of central
Europe and northern Italy and they went on to conquer the whole of
that country. Around 280 BC they swept down into Asia Minor and
reoccupied the lands of their ancestors.
As the historian Professor
Henry Rawlinson said:
These two great invasions into Asia Minor
proceeded from the same identical race, in the first instance called
the Cimmerians and in the second, the Gauls.
These invading Gauls
based themselves in a place called Phrygia which became known as
Galatia (Gaul-atia) and it was to these people that St Paul was
supposed to have written in the New Testaments Letter to the
Galatians. The Cimmerians or Cimbri also settled in Wales and to
this day the name for that country in the Welsh language is Cymru.
The Scythians, another Aryan group, also moved north from the
Caucasus into Europe where their name was changed by the Romans to
distinguish between them and other peoples. The sacred emblems of
the Scythians included the serpent, the Ox (Nimrod/Taurus), fire
(the Sun, knowledge), and Tho or Theo, the god the Egyptians called
Pan. The Romans called the Scythians the Sarmatae and the Germani
from the Latin word Germanus, meaning genuine.
The Scythians were
known, therefore, as the Genuine People and of course from Germani
we get German and Germany. The name change is confirmed by the
writings of the Roman historians Pliny and Strabo.
The Anglo-Saxons
who invaded Britain were also known as Germani by the Romans. The
land called Old Saxony is modern day north Germany and the
Netherlands. Both the Angles and the Saxons came from the same
genetic source - the white Cimmerians and Scythians from the Caucasus
and the Middle/Near East. It is the same with William the Conqueror
and his Normans, the last people to invade Britain in 1066 at the
Battle of Hastings.
The terms Norman and Normandy originate from the
Norse (North) men because they came from Scandinavia to occupy that
region of France. The story of the Scandinavian hero Odin, says that
he came from Asaland or Asaheim, which just happens to be the lands
of Scythia and can be identified in Aryan India. From there about
200 to 300 AD, it is said, Odin led a huge army north to conquer
Sweden. His army was called the Svear and in Swedish that country is
still called Sverige, the Land of the Svear.
Another group of Scythians, who became known as the Sakkas, went
east from the
Caucasus following the trail of the earlier Aryans and they reached
the borders of China by
175 BC. About this time Chinese records tell of a people called the
Sai-wang or Sok-wang
who were forced to flee India. Sok-wang means Sakka princes.
The
records indicate that
these Sakka retreated south into India through the mountain passes
from Afghanistan, and
coins dating from about 100 BC confirm that a Sakka kingdom was
created in the upper
Indus valleys between Kashmir and Afghanistan. Again it is not a
coincidence that the
religion of Buddhism emerged from lands occupied by the Sakka (Aryan
Scythians).
At
least by 500 BC a tribe called the Sakyas lived in the area where
Buddha is supposed to
have been born around 63 years earlier. Gautama (Lord Buddha) was
called Sakyashina, Sakamuni, the Sakya sage, Sakya the teacher and
the lion of the tribe of Sakya. All this will become highly
significant when we look at the single origin of all the major, and
most minor, religions and their heroes.
The Scythian/Sakka and the
Cimmerians/Cimbri were in fact all the same people and this is
confirmed by inscriptions scored into the Behistun Rock in the
Zargos Mountains on an old caravan trail from Babylon. The
inscriptions were ordered by Darius the Great about 515 BC and they
were written in three languages, Babylonian, Elamite and Persian.
Whenever the Elamite and Persian versions say Sakka, the
Persians/Babylonians use the term Cimiri.
So these white Aryan peoples under different names with their same
religion and religious heroes under different names, expanded from
their origins in the Caucasus and the Middle and Near East and went
overland into Europe, India and as far as China. And within them
were the reptile-human bloodlines who battled for, and eventually
won, supremacy to control the course of events as the kings, queens,
priests and military leaders under the collective title I dub
the
Babylonian Brotherhood. That the Babylonians were part of the Aryan
race is confirmed by ancient inscriptions and titles.
The Kassi or Cassi was a title first used by the Phoenicians about
3,000 BC and this
was adopted by the Babylonians who ruled the Mesopotamian empire.
Kassi also
appears as a personal name of Phoenicians in Egypt and Cassi was the
inspiration for
the ruling kings known as Catti in pre-Roman Britain, one of whom
minted Cas coins
featuring the sun-horse and other solar symbols.27
This Aryan expansion began as far back as 3,000 BC, probably
earlier, with their seafaring branch, the Phoenicians. They were a
technologically advanced people who have been marginalized by
official history and this has obscured their true identity. They are
fundamental to understanding where we have come from and where we
are now. It was they who brought both their genetic lines and their
knowledge to Europe, Scandinavia and the Americas, thousands of
years BC.
Their story is told by L. A. Waddell in his book, The
Phoenician Origin Of Britons, Scots And Anglo-Saxons. Waddell was a
fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute and spent a lifetime
researching the evidence. He shows that the Phoenicians were not a
Semitic race as previously believed, but a white Aryan race.
Examination of Phoenician tombs reveals that they were a long-headed
Aryan race and of a totally different racial type to the Semites.
The Phoenicians of the ancient world travelled by sea from their
bases in Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt to settle in the islands of the
Mediterranean like Crete and Cyprus and also Greece and Italy. It
was the Phoenicians who carried the knowledge which later emerged as
the civilizations of Minoan Crete, classic Greece and Roman Italy.
They were also the brains behind much of the Egyptian culture in
this period, before it was hijacked by the reptilians.
The Egyptians knew the Phoenicians as the Panag, Panasa and
Fenkha.
The Greeks
called them the Phoinik-as, and to the Romans they were the
Phoenic-es. There is a
simple reason why the Egyptians depicted many of their gods with
white skin and
blue eyes in exactly the same way as other cultures all over the
world did. This
advanced race, called the Phoenicians, were white skinned and often
had blue eyes the same as the reptilian-human crossbreeds and the
same, it would appear, as the race from Mars.
Thus we have the
Scandinavian races, which were installed by the Phoenicians and
other peoples of the same bloodstock and general location. It is
also the origin of the Aryan Master Race nonsense which obsessed
the Nazis and the secret societies which created them. The hero of
the Freemason secret society to this day is the mythical Hiram Abif,
the so-called builder of King Solomons Temple. Abif is supposed to
have been a Phoenician. The grandfather of the famous Egyptian
Pharaoh Akhenaten, the father of Tutankhamen, was a Phoenician high
priest.
The Phoenix, the mythical bird of Egypt, was in fact the Sun
bird of the Phoenicians, the emblem of the Sun God, Bil or Bel, and
as it has been later symbolized, a peacock or an eagle.
Evidence
has emerged in recent years about
pyramids on Mars, when the NASA
scientists, Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar, discovered six
enormous pyramids like those in Egypt in the Cydonia region of
Mars.30 It would make sense that the same Martian race with the same
knowledge would also build pyramids when they came to Earth, and the
same can be said of the Anunnaki if, as
Zecharia Sitchin speculates
and I agree, they had settlements on Mars.
The Phoenicians were not confined to the Mediterranean and the
Middle East. They landed in Britain around 3,000 BC and unmistakable
Phoenician artifacts have been found in Brazil, as well as possible
Egyptian remains in the Grand Canyon in America. The Phoenicians
landed in the Americas thousands of years before the manufactured
photo opportunity better known as
the journey of Christopher
Columbus. The reason that the native legends of the Americas speak
of tall white gods coming from the sea bringing advanced knowledge
is because that is precisely what happened, if you forget the gods
bit.
They were the Aryan race and the reptile-Aryans from the east
landing in the Americas thousands of years ago, the same Aryan race
or gods who the Sumerians said gifted them their civilization
after the flood. This is also why the later white invaders who
followed Columbus were astonished to find that the native peoples of
the American continent had the same basic religious stories and
myths as they had. This is perfectly explainable now. They came from
the same source - the Aryan race known as the Phoenicians among many
other names like Sumerian and Hittite with the reptile-Aryan
bloodlines within them.
There also seems to have been a direct
reptilian invasion in the Americas way back. The evidence of an
advanced race who knew the Americas existed, comes with
centuries-old maps like the Hadji Ahmed Portolan Map, compiled in
1519, which depicts the North American continent with a wide
causeway connecting Alaska and Siberia. There is also an accurate
drawing of
an ice-free Antarctica.
The arrival of the Aryan Phoenicians in Britain also corresponds
with the
building of the great stone circles and observatories like
Stonehenge and Avebury in
Wiltshire, although some researchers say they were built much
earlier.
The
advanced Phoenicians-Sumerians, who had a highly developed knowledge
of
astronomy, astrology, sacred geometry, mathematics and the Earths
magnetic force
line network known as the global energy grid, had all the knowledge
necessary to build these great structures.
L. A. Waddell said that
he found Sumerian markings on one of the stones at Stonehenge. Professor Alexander Thom, Emeritus Professor of Engineering Science
at Oxford University from 1945 to 1961, discovered that the ancients
who built Stonehenge knew about Pythagorean geometric and
mathematical principles thousands of years before Pythagoras was
born.
Thom explained in his 1967 book, Megalithic Sites In Britain,
that the stones not only formed geometric patterns in and around the
circle, they also aligned to features in the surrounding landscape
and to the positions of the Sun, Moon and prominent stars at
particular times, particularly where the Sun appeared or disappeared
at the equinox or solstice and where the Moon was at the extreme
positions of its cycle.
It was a gigantic astronomical clock, he
said. But it is more than that. It is a receiver and transmitter of
energy.
The Earths magnetic grid, or grids, consist of lines of
magnetic energy known as ley lines, meridians or dragon lines to the
Chinese. Where these lines cross, the energy spirals into a vortex
and where many lines cross you have a massive vortex of energy.
These are the power places, the sacred sites of the ancients who
knew of this system. The vortex, or spiral, is a constant throughout
the Universe. Our galaxy is a spiral, water spirals downwards, hair
grows in a spiral at the crown, the DNA molecule which carries our
genetic blueprint is a double spiral.
Brian Desborough, my scientist
friend from California, told me there is a point on one of the Earth
grids, the Hartmann Grid as it is called, where twelve of these
force lines meet and go down into the Earth. Where was that? I
asked. A place called Avebury in England he said.
The very place
the advanced Phoenician-Sumerians chose to build their stone circles
at least five thousand years ago along with a series of surrounding
sites, including Silbury Hill, the biggest human-made mound in
Europe, and others like West Kennet Long Barrow. These form a sort
of circuit board at the heart of the energy grid which
fundamentally affects the nature of the Earths magnetic field. I
lived near Avebury for two years and it is an incredibly powerful
place if you are sensitive to energy. It is also the area where most
of the crop circles or more accurately, crop formations, have
appeared, particularly the most complex of them.
Even more interesting is the apparent connection between Avebury and
Mars. The best known researcher of the apparently man-made structure
called the Face on Mars and an area of that planet known as
Cydonia, is the American
Richard C. Hoagland. He has been a science
journalist, a director of planetariums in West Hartford and New
York, and an advisor at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
Hoagland produces evidence in his book, Monuments On Mars,32 that
the alleged face and the pyramids are part of a vast area built to
align with the sunrise on the Martian summer solstice 500,000 years
ago - 50,000 years before the estimated arrival on Earth of the
Anunnaki. I have little doubt that the same race that built the
structures in Cydonia, including pyramids, also built Stonehenge and
Avebury.
There is evidence, in fact, that Avebury could be a mirror image of
the complex at
Cydonia. When you take same scale topographical maps of both places
and
superimpose one on the other, the correlation of objects and the
distances between them is incredibly similar, as members of
Hoaglands team established.
Figure 9:
Leonardo da Vincis depiction of Man according to
the
sacred geometry known as the Golden Mean.
He also discovered that this Mars City was built
according to the same laws used to create other similar complexes on
the Earth. The same mathematics, alignments and sacred geometry can
be found in
Cydonia on Mars and in the great structures of the
ancient world like those at Stonehenge, the pyramids at
Giza in
Egypt,
Teotihuacan in Mexico and in
Zimbabwe.
These mathematics
accord with the Golden Mean geometry as depicted by the Italian
artist, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), in his picture of the man
inside a circle (see Figure 9). Da Vinci, as we shall see, was a
leading initiate of the secret society network and this is how he
was able to predict the coming of the telephone, design flying
machines and tanks, and design bicycles in the 15th and 16th
centuries which look basically like the modern version today.
Another constant is
the latitude of 19.5 degrees. This is the
latitude on which the pyramids, many ancient temple complexes, and
other sacred structures were built.
It is also where you will find the volcanoes on Hawaii, the Schild
volcanoes on
Venus, the massive Olympus Mons volcano on Mars, the dark spot on
Neptune, the red spot on Jupiter and the main area of sunspot
activity, north and south, on the Sun.
This all fits like a glove,
because sunspots are emissions of incredibly powerful
electromagnetic energy from the Sun, and volcanoes are obvious
emissions of energy from the planets. Not surprisingly, therefore,
19.5 degrees is the point of energy exchange between rotating
spheres and the hierarchy of the ancients knew this. The Sumerians
knew, for instance, about the cycle of what is called precession.
This is the effect of the Earths wobble which slowly moves the
planet on its axis so that it faces different star systems or
astrological houses over many thousands of years.
As their records
show, the Sumerians knew that it took 2,160 years for the Earth to
move through each house and 25,920 years to complete the cycle -
the period it also takes the solar system to complete its journey
around its galactic centre. We are completing one of these cycles
now, hence the enormous change that is upon us.
Ancient temples all
over the world reflect these cycles of precession in their geometry
and mathematics. Isnt it amazing what primitive people can do?
The Elite of the Phoenician-Aryans had enormous knowledge of the
Earths energy grid and its potential to affect human consciousness.
After all, we live within the planets magnetic field.
When it
changes, we change. If you live in water and the water changes, you
are fundamentally affected and it is the same with the energy
ocean that we occupy. Thus you have the movement of the planets
affecting the Earths magnetic field and through that affecting us.
The Brotherhood dont want us to know any of this and so they have
used their religions, like Christianity, to condemn astrology as the
work of the Devil and their science to dismiss it as mumbo-jumbo.
The mystery stone circles and structures are much less mysterious
when you seek
answers with open minded research. The evidence strongly suggests
that they were built
by the Phoenician-Aryans who came here from the Middle and Near
East. It is the same
with the mystery white horses scored into the chalk hillsides of
Britain. Just before I
wrote this chapter, I visited the oldest white horse in Britain, the
famous one at
Uffington in Wiltshire, not far from Avebury (see picture section).
The plaque said that
its date of construction was about 3,000 BC - exactly the period
when the Phoenicians
arrived in the British Isles. Why should the Phoenicians score white
horses into the
hillsides of Britain? Again, the answer is simple. Their religion
was focused on the Sun
and the white horse was a Phoenician symbol for the Sun.
The great
stone circles and
structures throughout Britain, like Stonehenge and Avebury, were
built with the
knowledge held by the ruling and priestly classes of the Phoenicians
and the
Babylonian Brotherhood which infiltrated and eventually controlled
the Aryan
leadership.
This knowledge included the ability to use sound and
other techniques to
throw a magnetic field around a massive stone and delink it from the
laws of gravity. It
then becomes weightless. This period of around 3,000 BC is very
significant. While the
Phoenicians were at work in this period in Britain and elsewhere,
the pyramids at Giza
in Egypt have also been dated to around 3,000 BC using the latest
carbon dating
methods. Traces of charcoal found within the mortar apparently made
this possible.34
The Aryans of the Near and Middle East had many names, the Hittites,
the Phoenicians,
the Goths and so on. You can follow words and names through these
apparently different
cultures to show that they came from the same source. Some of the
stone circles are
sometimes called Hare-Stones which, according to L. A. Waddells
research, evolved
through Harri or Heria, the title for the ruling Goths, and from the
Hittite title of Harri, Arri
or Aryan: Hare stones are Aryan stones. Just as Han Khrishna means
Aryan Khrishna, very
appropriate given that the Hindu religion was the work of the
Aryans. You also have
Castlerigg stone circle near Keswick in Cumberland.
The word rig
was a title for Gothic
kings and princes and the Gothic came from the Aryans. Ancient
depictions of Aryan kings
in Cilicia have them wearing the Gothic style of dress. The name of
Keswick itself means
Abode of the Kes - the Cassi or Khatti clan of the Hittites - and
the county of
Cumberland has evolved through
names like Cymry and Cumbers
from its origin, Sumer. The term
Aryan comes from a Phoenician
word, Arri, meaning noble one.
Thus we get the names Sum-ARIAN
and aristocracy or ARIAN-stock-racy.
The lion has always been
a major symbol through the ages
because it was an Aryan symbol for
the Sun and was often placed at the
entrances to temples and sacred
places. Hence the lion-bodied
Sphinx which also relates to the
astrological sign of Leo, again
considered in astrology to be the
sign ruled by the Sun. The whole
foundation of British culture and
legend came from the Phoenicians.
The famous legend of St George and
the Dragon comes from St George
of Cappadocia, the Phoenician
centre in Asia Minor. The battles
between St George and the dragon could well have been symbolic of
the Martian-reptilian
conflicts which seem to go back a very long way.
The red cross of St
George (England)
and the crosses of St Andrew (Scotland) and St Patrick (Ireland),
and the ensigns of
Scandinavia, were all carried as sacred standards of victory by the
Phoenicians. The red
cross was the fire cross, a Phoenician-Aryan symbol for the Sun, as
was the swastika, later
used by the Nazis.
A swastika can be seen on a stone dedicated to
the Phoenician Sun-god Bel, which was found at Craig-Narget in Scotland and was used to
decorate the robes of
their high priestesses (see Figures 10 and 11).
Figure 10:
The swastika, the Phoenician sun symbol, on the
Phoenician Craig-Narget stone in Scotland and,
Figure 11,
on
the robe of a Phoenician High Priestess.
Figure 12:
The Phoenician depiction of Barati (right) and the
British symbol of Britannia.
They are the same deity and alternative
names for Queen Semiramis in Babylon and Isis in Egypt.
I read that the name swastika comes from the Sanskrit
word, svasti, which means well-being, and it was considered a
positive symbol until the Nazis turned it around and made it a
symbol of destruction. L. A.
Waddell translated the markings on another stone in Scotland, the
Newton Stone in the
Dumfries and Galloway region, to be Phoenician-Hittite and dedicated
to their Sun god, Bel or Bil.
The classic British symbol of Britannia comes from the
Phoenician goddess,
Barati. Look at how the Phoenicians depicted Barati and how the
British depict
Britannia in Figure 12!
One of the major centres of the
Aryan-Hittite-Phoenicians was
Cilicia in Asia Minor and here Barati was worshipped as Perathea and
later Diana. So
Diana and Britannia originate
from the same source. Barati
was the queen/goddess figure of
the Phoenicians as Barat was the
god/king.
These are possibly
names for the Babylonian deities
Nimrod and Semiramis. The
royal elite clan of the Aryans
were (are) called the Barats and
this is why you find the term
Barat or Brihat in the ancient
Indian culture as you do with
Britain and British (Barat-ain
and Barat-ish).
The Indian Vedas
say that,
King Barat gave his
name to the Dynastic Race of which he was the founder; and so it is
from him that the
fame of that Dynastic people hath spread so wide.
Parat, Prat and
Prydi, are some of
the other derivatives of Barat. The original form was Barat-ana or
Brithad-ana.36 The
suffix ana in Hittite-Sumerian (Aryan) means one. Ana in fact
evolved into the
English word one and the Scottish ane. Barat-ana or Briton
therefore means One of
the Barats (Bruits). It is the same with many other countries
occupied by this white
race. The name Iran comes from the earlier Airy-Ana or Air-an, which
means Land of
the Arrays or Aryans.
The Indian Vedas also acknowledge the goddess Barati (Belonging to
the Barats), and she was known as Brihad the Divine. They say her
special place was on the Saras-vati River which happens to be the
modern Sarus River in the Hittite-Phoenician land of Cilicia.
The river entered the sea at Tarsus, the alleged home of St Paul in
the New Testament, a
work written in accordance with Aryan sun myths. Also, these
Phoenicians and Aryans
worshipped the serpent and the shape-shifting reptilians called the
Nagas were the serpent
gods of the Hindus. The Vedas, inspired by the Aryans, tell how the
serpent-humans, the
Nagas, could cause fantastic damage and instant death.
The Nagas
were also said to have
appeared at the birth of the man who became known as Buddha and the
serpent plays a part
in the legend of Khrishna.
The Roman name for Barati was Fortune
after her legend as the
goddess of fortune. They depicted Fortune in the same way as the
Phoenicians symbolized
Barati and the British do with Britannia. All were associated with
water as you expect with a sea-faring race like the Phoenicians.
The
Egyptians, too, had a goddess called Birth, the goddess of the
waters, and she was another mirror of Barati because the
Aryan-Phoenicians were the force behind Egypt. Birth was described
by a Babylonian emperor about 680 BC as a Phoenician god across the
sea
In Crete, another Phoenician centre under the title Minoan,
their goddess was Brito-Martis. She was a Phoenician goddess
according to Greek and Roman legend (Barati in other words) and the
divine daughter of Phoenix, the king of Phoenicia.
Brito-Martis
became identified with the goddess Diana, a major deity of the
ancient world, and like her she was armed for the hunt. As Earl
Spencer made a point of emphasizing at the funeral of his sister
Diana, Princess of Wales, she was named after the ancient goddess of
hunting.
The early British kings called themselves and their race the Catti
and this appears on their coins. The Aryan Hittites of Asia Minor
and Syria-Phoenicia called themselves the Catti or Khatti. The race
of Aryans who left the Caucasus to rule India were known as the
Khattiyo. The term Khatti evolved through the Hebrew and English
translations into the Hittites of the Old Testament. Kassi or Cassi
was the title used by the first Phoenician dynasty about 3,000 BC
and was adopted by the Babylonian dynasty. Not surprising because
these were different branches of the same people.
The ancient Indian
Epic king lists name some of the same people named in the
Mesopotamian king lists and the predynastic civilizers of early
Egypt also turn out to be of the Aryan race. We are looking at the
same people here, no doubt whatsoever, and within this race are the
reptile-Aryan bloodlines which have increasingly held the reins of
power from the ancient world to the present day. As L. A. Waddell
points out, the English, Scottish, Irish, Gaelic, Welsh, Gothic and
Anglo-Saxon languages and their writing, and the entire family of
Aryan languages, derive from the Aryan Phoenician language via the
Hittite and Sumerian.
About half of the commonest words used in the
so-called English language today are of Sumerian, Cyprian or Hittite
origin with the same sound and meaning. Sumerian, the language of
the gods, is the parent language for most of the world, although I
think it originated somewhere else even further back in history,
maybe
Atlantis or even the area today called the British Isles.
As
Waddell says:
I had recognized that the various ancient scripts found at or near
the old settlements of
the Phoenicians, and (those known as) Cyprian, Karian, Aramaic or
Syrian, Lykian, Lydian,
Corinthian, lonian, Cretan or Minoan, Pelasgian, Phrygian,
Cappadocian, Cilician,
Theban, Libyan, Celto-Iberian, Gothic Runes etc, were all really
local variations of the
standard Aryan Hitto-Sumerian writing of the Aryan Phoenician
mariners, those ancient
pioneer spreaders of the Hittite Civilization along the shores of
the Mediterranean and out
beyond the Pillars of Hercules to the British Isles.39
Official history asks us to believe that the people of Britain were
savages who were
civilised only after the Romans came. This is not true and in fact
the Romans said the
opposite. Roman records say that the Britons were generally
civilized and their customs
much the same as the Gauls. Of course they were. They were the same
people with the same origins.
The Britons used gold money and there
was trade with the European continent, as British coins of the
period found there have confirmed. It was only the people of the
interior of Britain, still uninfluenced by the Phoenician culture
closer to the coasts, whom the Romans regarded as uncivilised when
they arrived.
Many of the roads regarded as Roman were not built
by the Romans at all. They were pre-Roman roads which they repaired.
The Romans admired the efficiency of the British armies,
particularly their use of war chariots. You wont be surprised to
know by now that these famous British chariots were the same as
those used by the Hittites or Catti described by the Egyptian
Pharaoh Ramses II around 1,295 BC at the Battle of Kadesh, a
Hittite-Phoenician port. In about 350 BC, three centuries before the
Romans arrived, the explorer and scientist, Pytheas, sailed around
Britain and mapped the land scientifically with latitudes.
Pytheas
was a native of Phocca in Asia Minor, Phocca deriving from
Phoenicia, as did an adjoining port called Phoenice. By this time
the Phoenicians had organized the tin trade, from their mines in
Cornwall in the west of England across Gaul/France to Marseilles,
from where it was taken by sea to the lands of the Mediterranean and
Aegean. The first Phoenician tin-port in Cornwall was Ictis or St
Michaels Mount in Penzance Bay. St Michael, one of the great heroes
of Christianity, was in truth a Phoenician deity.
There is endless evidence to prove the ancient link between the
British Isles and Ireland and the culture of North Africa and the
Near East. They say if you want to expose corruption, follow the
money. Well if you want to identify the passage of people and
cultures, follow the language. The Irish language today is English
which replaced Gaelic and Gaelic itself evolved from a now lost
earlier language.
Gaelic speaking missionaries in the Middle Ages
had to use interpreters to communicate with the Picts, the ancient
people of what became Scotland, and Cormac, a Gaelic-speaking Irish
king of the ninth century, referred to the language of the people of
Munster in south west Ireland as the iron language. But even
Gaelic connects us very firmly into the Middle East.
In Conamara, in
the west of Ireland, is a community which still speaks Gaelic as its
first language. Their sean-nos (old style) singing, the basis of all
Irish music, is amazingly similar to the native songs of the Middle
East. Even trained ears find it almost impossible to distinguish
between the chants of the Gaelic singers and those of Libyans.
Charles Acton, the music critic of the Irish Times, wrote:
If one listened for hours in the desert of an evening to Bedoum
Arabs singing narrative
epics... and then returned to Ireland and heard a fine sean-nos
singer using the same mel
ismata and rhythm, one finds the resemblance almost uncanny. So,
too, if one listens to
(the Spanish) canto jondo
There were major sea trading routes between Ireland and Spain and
Spain and
North Africa in ancient times through which the passage of
bloodlines,
knowledge and culture was transported. The Spanish Arch in Galway in
the west
of Ireland commemorates this, as does the Conamara dancing known as
the battering which is virtually the same as Spanish Flamenco. The
stick dance performed by the Wexford Mummers in Ireland is of North
African origin. The word mummer comes from Mohammedan.
The Irish
symbol, the harp, came from North Africa and so did the name of that
other classic symbol of Ireland, the shamrock. Any three leaf plant
is known in Egypt as a shamrukh. The rosary beads, the symbol of
devout Roman Catholics, come from the Middle East and are still used
by the Egyptians. The word nun is Egyptian and their garments are
from the Middle East.
According to Arbois de Juvainville, the author
of a work called Cours De Literature Celtigue, the Irish were known
as Egyptians in the Middle Ages. There are obvious connections
between Irish books and those of the Egyptians. They employ the same
styles of illustration and the colours used in the Irish Book of
Kells and Book of Durrow are of Mediterranean origin.
The red used
in these books came from a Mediterranean insect, the Kermococcus
vermiho, and others came from a Mediterranean plant, the Crozophora
tinctoria. The crossed arms pose of many Egyptian portrayals of
their god, Osiris, can be seen in Irish manuscripts. The Irish
sweaters made on the Isle of Arran carry, according to at least one
expert on the history of knitting, designs first given to them by
Egyptian Coptic monks.42
The main blood group of Arran (Aryan?) is
different from most of the Irish population. The old Irish sailing
craft called pucan was invented by the North Africans and used on
the Nile. Excavations at Navan Fort, near Armagh City, found remains
of the Barbary ape estimated to have lived about 500 BC. The Barbary
ape today is mainly associated with Gibraltar, but its home in 500
BC was North Africa.
Libyan dragonskins (mercenaries) were believed
to have been at large in Ireland 2,000 years ago. In the second
century, the geographer Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria, could name
sixteen tribes in Ireland. The Irish sport of hurling is mirrored by
the game called Takourt in Morocco. Irish ritual was, like all the
cultures inspired by the Phoenician-Aryans, focused on the Sun.
The
Earth mound at Newgrange in Ireland has a narrow passageway of some
62 feet which is perfectly aligned with the Sun as it rises on
December 2lst/22nd, the winter solstice. So much so that the golden
sunlight fills and illuminates the whole passage and the chamber at
the centre. The entrance to structures in the Mediterranean,
particularly the one at the Palace of Minos in Crete, are the same.
The distinctive Round Towers of Ireland are, according to some orientalists, of Phoenician origin.43 Again all this fits perfectly
into the story I am revealing here. The Phoenicians came from the
Middle and Near East, one of the global centres for the
Anunnaki-reptilians and, according to the research of Professor
Phillip Calahan I mentioned earlier, the round towers are aligned
with stars systems in the northern sky especially Draco.
The connections between Ireland and the Berbers of Morocco deserves
a special
mention. They are a light-skinned mountain people, some blue-eyed
and blond-haired. They are associated with the Atlas Mountains which are
themselves associated
with Atlantis and named after Atlas, a son of the legendary ruler of
Atlantis,
Poseidon. Berber art has many similarities to the Irish version and
anyone speaking
Gaelic could comfortably understand the Berber tongue.
The main
Berber clans like MTir, MTuga and MGhill, are obvious origins or
derivatives of the Ireland-Scottish MacTier, MacDougal and MacGhill.
The term Mac means children or child of and the Arabs use the term
Bini, as in Bini MTir, which means the same. Missionaries who first
explored the lands of the Berbers found that they used bagpipes, as
do the Irish and Scots. Early invaders of Ireland were known as the
men with the leather bags. An Irish goatskin drum found in Kerry is
a twin of the Moroccan drum, the bindir.
The violin and the guitar
also originate in North Africa. The Viking wing of the Aryans
invaded Ireland and founded many towns, including the present
capital city of Dublin. But, not surprisingly in the light of the
evidence you have been reading, the famous Viking galley with the
high front and stern was a Phoenician design used by the Egyptians.
Rock carvings at Newgrange appear to depict this design thousands of
years earlier. The
name Idris is well known in Wales and the saints and kings of the
Muslims have been
called Idris for centuries. In the British Museum is a Muslim coin,
a gold dinar, which
has the name Offa stamped upon it. Offa was the King of Mercia in
England in the 8th
century and he is said to have built the 120 mile earth wall
between England and
Wales known as Offas Dyke. The name Wales comes from Weallas
meaning Land of
Foreigners.
The Welsh, like the Irish, explored the northern waters
around Iceland
before the Vikings and it is said that the Welshman Prince Madoc
went ashore in
America three centuries before Columbus. Thats very possible
because if he had access
to the knowledge of the Phoenicians, he would have known that the
Americas were
there. The Venerable Bede of Cymbri (approximately the Welsh) said
they were an
Eastern people who migrated after the flood from the lands of the
Bible to the British
Isles.44
When the Irish settled in parts of Wales and Cornwall, some of the
displaced people moved to Armorica, now Brittany, on the French
coast. There you find the fantastic forest of standing stones called
Carnac, a name which comes from Karnac in Egypt. The Breton language
is a mixture of old Welsh and Cornish - Aryan. Brittany means Little
Britain and relates again to Barat and Barati. Amorica means land
facing the sea, a perfect description of America approached from
the Atlantic. This is surely the true origin of the name America,
and not Amerigo Vespucci, the explorer from Florence who was the
contractor for Christopher Columbus in Spain.
The Isle of Man was
also populated by the Irish Aryans and it became a very sacred land.
It was one of two places in Britain, Anglesea in North Wales was
other, where the Arch Druids were based. These were the highest
ranked members of the ancient British priestly class, who inherited
their knowledge from the Phoenicians and later the Babylonian
Brotherhood. The Isle of Mans three legs symbol is not unlike that
ancient Phoenician symbol for the Sun, the swastika. Irish
connections with Ethiopia have also been identified.
An American
researcher, Winthrop Palmer Boswell, wrote a book called Irish
Wizards In The Woods Of Ethiopia in which she showed the
similarities between Irish and Ethiopian folk stories. The baobab
tree is held in great reverence by Ethiopians and Berbers and
banba is an old name for Ireland.
This reverence for trees in North Africa was expressed in the
British Isles and Europe by the Druids and the giant or Titan race,
the reptilian-human crossbreeds of the ancient Near East, were often
symbolized as trees because of their height. In his 1833 book,
Phoenician Ireland, Joachim de Villeneuve, insisted that Irish
Druids were the snake priests of the Phoenician seafarers. This
would certainly explain the origin of the Balor of the Evil Eye, the
Irish version of the North African god Baal, and the celebration in
May of the Baal ritual, Beltane.
The evil eye relates to the
hypnotic stare of the reptilians. The Sun god of the Phoenicians was Bel or Bil and later became known by the Canaanites and Babylonians
as Baal - Nimrod. The Druids became the carriers of the mystery
school tradition in Britain, Ireland and France or Britannia, Eire
and Gaul as they were then called, and some of them became deeply
corrupted by the influence of the reptile-human bloodlines of the
Babylonian Brotherhood which established control of the Aryan
priesthood as the centuries passed. The origin of the word Druid is
not certain. A Gaelic word, druidh, means a wise man or a
sorcerer, but it may come from the Irish word, Drui, which means
men of the oak trees.
The Druidic Mysteries were taught in the
darkness of caves, forests and groves with the oak tree symbolizing
their Supreme Deity (very much in line with the Watcher
tree-symbolism). They did not worship the oak tree, it was a symbol
and anything which grew upon it, like mistletoe, became sacred. The
holly bush was another sacred symbol of the Druids and this is where
we get the name Hollywood in Los Angeles, the centre of the global
film industry which was created by modern initiates of the
Babylonian Brotherhood.
It has remained in their control and
Hollywood is one of their most important vehicles for mass mind
conditioning. Hollywood is indeed a place of magic as it casts a
spell on humanitys perception of itself and the world. The Druids
knew about astrology and astronomy and they celebrated the birth of
the Sun on December 25th. The Moon was also very important to them.
Particularly sacred was the night of the new Moon, the sixth day,
and the full Moon.
As with the Blue Degrees of modern Freemasonry, the Druid initiates
were divided into three groups. The teachings given to each level in
the forest groves of ancient times and the Freemasonic temples of
today are virtually the same. The first level of the Druid School
was the Ovate who was dressed in green, the Druidic colour for
learning. The second was the Bard, who wore sky blue representing
harmony and truth. They had the task of memorizing some of the
20,000 verses of Druidic poetry within which the mysteries were
hidden. The third, the Druid, would be dressed in a white robe,
their symbolic colour for purity and the Sun.
To become an
Arch-Druid, a spiritual leader, you had to pass six levels of
degree. The Druids had total power over the population for a long
time and some deeply unpleasant rituals emerged after their mystery
school network was taken over by the Babylonian Brotherhood. The
basic moral code was taught to all people, but the secret knowledge
was, as with all these networks, preserved for initiates under the
strictest secrecy.
Eliphas Levi, the famous esotericist, said of
their healing methods:
The Druids were priests and physicians, curing by magnetism...
Their universal remedies
were mistletoe and serpents eggs, because these substances attract
astral light in a
special manner. The solemnity with which mistletoe was cut down drew
upon this plant the
popular confidence and rendered it powerfully magnetic.46
The Druids, like the other mystery religions, were carriers of
advanced knowledge which has been kept from the people, and some of
them used it for less than positive reasons. I am not condemning the
Druids as a whole and I certainly do not wish to cast a negative
interpretation on the work of modern Druids.
Knowledge is neutral
and the same knowledge can be used with good or malevolent intent.
But there is no doubt that the Druidic religion was infiltrated and
began to manifest the classic rituals and behavior of the
reptilians, including human sacrifice. The Brotherhood today still
uses Druidic rituals in its own black magic ceremonies.
Going home?
The evidence of the connections between the Middle-Near East and the
British Isles and Ireland is simply enormous. You can follow the
flow of peoples, knowledge, culture, language, deities, symbols and
rituals, very comfortably. I wonder, however, if this was all
traveling between these two areas of the world for the first time
from around 3,000 BC or whether, in the ancient past before the
Venus cataclysm, it had all gone in the reverse direction.
Could it
be that the origins of the Middle-Near East cultures had actually
been in what became the British Isles and Europe, and after 3,000 BC
it was taken in the reverse direction. I cant present detailed
evidence of this at the moment, but my research is moving that way.
If the British Isles and parts of Europe were badly affected by
Earth upheavals, maybe there was a mass movement of the advanced
race from many parts of the world to safer lands, particularly in
the Near East.
Certainly, the Babylonian Brotherhood and others with
advanced knowledge were very keen to make their way to Britain and
establish their headquarters there. London became the epicentre of
their operations and it remains so to this day. There must be a very
important reason for that and I think it relates to the energy
fields in these lands. The British Isles is a really sacred place to
the Brotherhood because it is the centre of the Earths energy grid.
It is not without reason that there is a greater concentration of
stone circles, standing stones, ancient mounds and sites, in areas
of Britain than in almost anywhere else in the world. Those who
understand how to manipulate energy and consciousness would seek to
base their activities at the heart centre of the planetary energy
grid and they have done this by operating so much of their Agenda
from the British Isles.
London is also a major site on the Earths magnetic grid and it
became the capital
not only of Britain or Barat-land, but also of the Babylonian
Brotherhood. To them, it is
their New Troy or New Babylon. The city of Troy in Asia Minor,
the place made
famous by the Trojan Wars and the Wooden Horse legend, was another
Aryan centre. It
was the old capital of the Hittites. Many of the reptile-Aryan
bloodlines appear to have
been based in Troy and it remains a sacred place for those at the
upper levels of the secret society network who are aware of their
true origins.
Troy or Troia means three places in Greek and
Hebrew, an allusion to the trinity, another belief that Christianity
has stolen from the ancient world. In English, Troy or Troia is
Tripoli, the name of the capital of Libya today and home to that
Brotherhood frontman, Colonel Gaddafi. Once again, Troy relates to
the extraterrestrial full-bloods and crossbreeds, hence the constant
obsession with that name by the Brotherhood.
In the Iliad epic,
believed to have been written by the Greek poet, Homer, it states
that Troy was founded by Dardanus, the son of the Greek god Zeus,
who was a Titan - the reptilian bloodline. Zeus was depicted as both
an eagle and a serpent. He was said to have been born in Arcadia, in
Sparta, and after the Trojan War many Spartans migrated into what is
now France. Terms like New Troy, therefore, relate to centers for
these same bloodlines.
Most people dont realize that London was founded as the New Troy.
After the destruction of Troy around 1,200 BC, the story goes that
Aeneas, born of a royal bloodline, fled with the remnants of his
people and settled in Italy. There he married the daughter of Latinus, the king of the Latins, and through this line later emerged
the Roman Empire.
According to many traditions, the grandson of
Aeneas, a man called Brutus, landed in Britain around 1,103 BC with
a group of Trojans, including some from colonies in Spain. They
referred to Britain as the Great White Island after the white
cliffs which abound on the South Coast. In the south west of England
is the town of Totnes in Devon, a short distance inland from Torbay,
the oldest seaport in the area.
Here there is a stone called the Brutus Stone on which, the legend
says, the former
Trojan prince stood after he first landed. Welsh records say that
Brutus was met by three
tribes of Britons who proclaimed him king. Brutus founded a city he
called Caer Troia - New Troy. The Romans would later call it Londinium.
London became the operational centre of the empire of the
Babylonian Brotherhood, and it still is, along with Paris and
the Vatican.
In the King
Arthur stories, London or New Troy, is Troynavant, King Arthurs
eastern gateway city and King Arthurs Camelot apparently means
Martian City or City of Mars. Artifacts discovered by the German
archaeologist, Heinrich Schliemann, at the site of ancient Troy,
contained many of the markings found on British megalithic stones.
They were also decorated with the swastika, the Phoenician-Aryan
symbol of the Sun. Once again, they were the same people. All the
white peoples are and it is the white race which has taken over the
world, quite demonstrably. Just look around you at who controls all
the reigns of global power. White people.
And within this race and
others, going back to antiquity, are the reptile bloodlines who are
today centered on London, New Troy, or more appropriately
New
Babylon. The bodies of these Elite bloodlines are occupied or
controlled by the reptiles of the lower fourth dimension and most of
the lesser Aryan hierarchy have no idea that this is so.
I will focus
on this reptilian-Anunnaki network and chart it into the modern
world when we have considered the truth about the religions which
the reptilians have used so effectively to batter the human race
into mental, emotional and spiritual submission.
