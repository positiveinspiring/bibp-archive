Al Qaeda & Islamophobic bigots
working in tandem exploiting fear and ignorance.
In France where people are sent to jail for
"Holocaust denial," considered by law a religious hate crime, it seems
strange then that well timed, raunchy cartoons designed solely to insult and
inflame hate against and amongst Muslims worldwide would be defended
vigorously by French politicians who claim,
according to the Christian Science Monitor, that,
"freedom of the press
should not be infringed."
With Neo-Conservative warmongers behind
a recent inflammatory film titled, "The Innocence of Muslims," and their
counterparts amongst radical sectarian extremists leading violent protests
across the Middle East and North Africa.
It would almost seem as if the
publication of insulting cartoons by a French paper, "Charlie Hebdo," was
part of a grander strategy to create a manufactured conflict between Islam
and the West, setting the stage for more overt military operations to take
over faltering covert operations in Syria and beyond.
France - and The West
- are Playing Both Sides
It is a fact that France itself has provided state sponsorship of terrorism
from Libya to Syria, arming, funding, and politically backing the very
groups taking to the streets, burning Western consulates, and killing
bystanders, diplomats, and security forces alike.
France had armed,
trained, funded,
and provided air support for
the
UN-listed terrorist outfit, the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) last year in Libya, in their bid to
overthrow the government of Muammar Qaddafi.

US State Department,
United Nations, and the
UK Home Office (page 5, .pdf) - listed terrorist
organization, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG),
addressing fellow terrorists in Syria.
Harati is now
commanding a Libyan brigade operating inside of Syria
attempting to destroy the Syrian government and
subjugate the Syrian population.
Traditionally, this is
known as "foreign invasion."
France is one of a handful
of nations currently leading state-sponsorship of
terrorist groups like LIFG in Syria.
LIFG had merged officially with Al Qaeda,
according to a US Army West Point Combating Terrorism Center report in 2007,
long before the French knowingly aided and abetted these terrorists in their
bid to overthrow and overrun Libya.
Currently, the government of France is
funding and arming these very same terrorists, who promptly transferred
weapons, cash, and fighters
to Syria to begin terror operations there.
The report titled, "Al-Qa'ida's
Foreign Fighters in Iraq" stated specifically:
The apparent surge in Libyan recruits
traveling to Iraq may be linked the Libyan Islamic Fighting Groups (LIFG)
increasingly cooperative relationship with al‐Qaida, which culminated
in the LIFG officially joining al‐Qaida on November 3, 2007. (page
9, .pdf)
France had recently announced its intentions to
overtly arm these terror groups operating in Syria, now exposed by Human
Rights Watch as carrying out systematic and widespread atrocities against
the Syrian population.
The Hindu, in their article, "France
to fund opposition in Syria," reported:
"Reuters quoted a diplomatic source as
saying France had started supporting parts of Syria that are apparently
being controlled by the armed opposition. More alarmingly, the report
pointed out that Paris was considering supplying heavy artillery to
anti-government fighters - a move that would harden the possibility of a
full-blown civil war in the country."
Now France, through its media, and the
complicity of its politicians' tacit support, is providing their new
terrorist allies with something else - a casus belli for confrontation with
the West to reinsert in the public's mind the adversarial plot device needed
to introduce more direct military intervention where the covert support of
listed-terrorist groups has now seemingly failed.
The Lie We Are
Expected to Believe
What we are now expected to believe is that France, the US, UK, and other
nations were benevolently, and unwittingly helping these groups into power,
only to be betrayed by extremists.
In reality, the nature of these militant groups was known years in advance,
these groups specifically chosen to lead the violent subversion of Western
targets across the Arab World - with the possibility of sectarian genocide
and significant blowback acknowledged as an acceptable risk.
In 2007, an article by Seymour Hersh published in the New Yorker titled,
"The Redirection" admitted that:
"To undermine Iran, which is predominantly
Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure
its priorities in the Middle East.
In Lebanon, the Administration has
cooperated with Saudi Arabias government, which is Sunni, in
clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite
organization that is backed by Iran.
The U.S. has also taken part in
clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria.
A by-product of
these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that
espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and
sympathetic to Al Qaeda."
-The
Redirection, Seymour Hersh (2007)
Hersh's report would also include:
"the Saudi government, with
Washingtons approval, would provide funds and logistical aid to weaken
the government of President Bashir Assad, of Syria.
The Israelis believe
that putting such pressure on the Assad government will make it more
conciliatory and open to negotiations."
-The
Redirection, Seymour Hersh (2007)
Clearly the West, including the complicit regimes of Nicolas Sarkozy and now
François Hollande, knowingly funded terrorists.
Hersh's report admits that
all parties involved even in 2007 knew full well the potential dangers
involved in funding terrorist groups but believed these forces could be
controlled:
"...[Saudi Arabia's] Bandar and other
Saudis have assured the White House that 'they will keep a very close
eye on the religious fundamentalists. Their message to us was Weve
created this movement, and we can control it.
Its not that we dont
want the Salafis to throw bombs; its who they throw them
at - Hezbollah, Moqtada al-Sadr, Iran, and at the Syrians, if they
continue to work with Hezbollah and Iran.
-The
Redirection, Seymour Hersh (2007)
For the West to feign that evidence Al Qaeda is
now overrunning the Middle East is somehow an unintended consequence, when
officials in 2007 were on record already implementing such a policy is
indeed a bold lie.
To help sell that lie, the West is calling on its
Neo-Conservative factions, and in particular, dusting off their
Islamophobia brigades led by the likes of Daniel Pipes,
a member of
the Bush administration, a Project for a New American Century (PNAC)
signatory, and a chief proponent for war with Syria and Iran, as well as
lesser demagogues such as Robert Spencer, Pamella Geller, and David
Horowitz.
The creation of a sectarian extremist front to undermine and destroy the
governments of Syria and Iran began under Bush in 2007 - Syria and Iran
being the specific targets Neo-Cons like Pipes have ceaselessly advocated
war with.
That Pipes and his compatriots
are now claiming the rise of this terrorist front (below video) they themselves helped
create is somehow the result of a "pro-Islam Obama" is immense propaganda
designed for the most impressionable minds.
The Plan - Flip the
Script (Again)
In reality,
Obama provided left-cover for a singular corporate-financier
driven agenda,
decided upon decades ago, and part of the reoccurring patterns and
themes
that define all empires past and present.
It appears that the public is becoming increasingly aware that the US has
just handed the nation of Libya over to sectarian extremists and is backing
brigades of these same terrorists, now operating in Syria.
The operation in
Syria seems to have reached a stalemate, with the further arming and backing
of increasingly visible terrorist forces a politically untenable option.
It appears that the alternative plan is to flip the script once more,
turning Al Qaeda - who began as celebrated freedom fighters battling Soviets
in the mountains of Afghanistan, to reviled terrorists waging a decade of
war on America in Iraq and Afghanistan, to freedom fighters seeking to oust
Qaddafi and President Bashar al-Assad, to once again back to reviled,
embassy attacking, ambassador-killing thugs.
Seemingly fully committed to tipping off a "clash of civilizations," the
ground is being prepared for false flag attacks and preparing public opinion
for more direct military intervention in places like
Syria and
Iran.
The
failures of the last four years of corporate-financier driven policy is
being compartmentalized around Obama and will be flushed with his presidency
either in 2012, or 2016 with the hopes that the agenda itself will survive
and carry on.
An Obama win in 2012 would allow the West to continue funding terrorists
more openly worldwide against the governments of Syria, Iran, and even
Russia and China - blaming it all on "Pro-Islam Obama."
A Romney victory
would allow more aggressive, direct military intervention.
Either way, the
nations of,
...will continue to find themselves
in the firing line of both covert and overt foreign military aggression.
The overall agenda is global corporate-financier hegemony, the destruction
of the nation-state, and the primacy of Wall Street-London dictated
"international law" for an "international order" corporate-financier
think-tank policy maker
Robert Kagan concedes,
"serves the needs of the United States and its
allies, which constructed it."
By recognizing the singular agenda front-men like
Bush, Obama, and Romney
cover for, we can expose the
corporate-financier special interests truly dictating Western policy.
By
understanding that it is corporate-financier interests, not politicians,
that drive these nefarious, overarching agendas, we can formulate solutions
based upon
undermining and replacing their power and influence, rather than
becoming absorbed in short-sighted political battles that ultimately change
only the front-men, not the agenda itself.
