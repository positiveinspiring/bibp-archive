# Declassified CIA Documents reveals Plan to Destroy Syria for Oil Pipeline 
- Predicts Current Crisis

President
Donald
Trump has repeatedly castigated President
Bashar al-Assad for
ordering a gruesome mass killing of civilians with chemical
weapons in Khan Sheikhoun.
This accusation,
unsubstantiated
due to lack of investigation, sparked a bolstering of support
for the Syrian regime from both Moscow and Tehran.
Were the account
of an ordered chemical weapons attack to prove unassailably true
- and Assad isn't exactly known for being a gentle despot - Trump could have handily earned a congressional green light and
perhaps approval from NATO to obliterate Syrian Arab Army forces
responsible.
Perhaps...
Yet - images of
deceased children, women, and men still echoing in shock waves
around the planet - the reality show host-turned American
President, tellingly, did neither.
Fifty-nine
$1.87 million Tomahawk missiles
raining down on a Syrian air base not long after the ostensive
toxic gassing answered with finality whether Trump would fall in
line with a succession of pompously bellicose presidents - as
well as whether the neocon political establishment's
longstanding mission to forcibly bend Syria to its will.
"Syria at
present has a hammerlock on US interests both in Lebanon and in
the Gulf - through closure of Iraq's pipeline thereby
threatening Iraqi internationalization of the war.
The US
should consider sharply escalating the pressures against
Assad through covertly orchestrating simultaneous military
threats against Syria from three border states hostile to
Syria:
While the
preceding bears the names of leaders and nations familiar to
current headlines, that
assessment, cogently
titled,
"Bringing
Real Muscle to Bear Against Syria," from former CIA officer
Graham
Fuller
in actuality discusses Syria under Assad's
predecessor - his father,
Hafez al-Assad
- and is dated September 14, 1983, amid the
Iran-Iraq War.
With Iraq
seeking to enjoin support internationally in the war, the U.S.
had to scramble to prevent the shutdown of a pipeline - a
dilemma Fuller suggests could be alleviated through a change in
narrative to present Syria as a more deviant enemy than even
Iran.
That, alone,
would have changed the face of the war bearing the names of the
two principal adversaries:
Fuller asserted,
"The US
should consider urging Iraq to take the war to the other key
source of its predicament: Syria."
Further, he
continued,
"The US
should consider sharply escalating the pressures against
Assad [Sr.] through covertly orchestrating simultaneous
military threats against Syria from three border states
hostile to Syria: Iraq, Israel and Turkey.
Iraq, perceived
to be increasingly desperate in the Gulf war, would
undertake limited military (air) operations against Syria
with the sole goal of opening the pipeline.
Although opening
war on a second front against Syria poses considerable risk
to Iraq, Syria would also face a two-front war since it is
already heavily engaged in the Bekaa, on the Golan and in
maintaining control over a hostile and restive population
inside Syria.
"Israel
would simultaneously raise tensions along Syria's Lebanon
front without actually going to war.
Turkey, angered by
Syrian support to Armenian terrorism, to Iraqi Kurds on
Turkey's Kurdish border areas and to Turkish terrorists
operating out of northern Syria, has often considered
launching unilateral military operations against terrorist
camps in northern Syria.
Virtually all Arab states would
have sympathy for Iraq.
"Faced with
three belligerent fronts, Assad would probably be forced to
abandon his policy of closure of the pipeline. Such a
concession would relieve the economic pressure on Iraq, and
perhaps force Iran to reconsider bringing the war to an end.
It would be a sharpening blow to Syria's prestige and could
effect the equation of forces in Lebanon."
In context,
then-President
Ronald Reagan
faced pressure both to insert military power in Lebanon - a
theater of stated neutrality for the U.S. - and to prohibit
actual military assistance in the fraught regional entanglement.
That is, until a
suicide bomber
decimated
a U.S. Marines barracks encamped at an airport in Beirut,
killing hundreds - just one month subsequent to the date on
Fuller's Syria action plan.
Micah Zenko,
Senior Fellow
at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) - an albeit establishment -
and
Deep State-connected think tank - in "When America Attacked Syria,"
wrote
in 2012:
"The October
23, 1983, suicide truck bombing of the Marine barracks at
the Beirut International Airport would kill 241 U.S.
military personnel; simultaneously, another suicide bomber
killed fifty-eight French servicemen of the MNF several
kilometers away.
(Two weeks
later, yet another truck bomb exploded in the Israeli
military headquarters in Tyre, killing sixty.)
A FBI
forensics assessment called the Marine barracks bombing the
'biggest non-nuclear explosion since World War II.'
According to a Pentagon commission formed to investigate the
attack, it was 'tantamount to an act of war using the medium
of terrorism.'
Within
weeks, the CIA determined that,
'the bombings
of the United
States and French MNF headquarters were carried out by Shia
radicals, armed, trained, and directed by Syria and Iran'."
That
the CIA - master meddler in the affairs of sovereign nations
- determined
fault for the bombings rested with Syria and Iran left both
plausibly responsible, with public perception largely following
suit.
That a situation
eerily similar - in behind-the-scenes string-pulling and
long-term U.S. commitment to deposing an Assad from rule in
Syria - appears to be playing out nearly three-and-a-half
decades later, bellows resoundingly on failures of
interventionist foreign policy.
Or,
perhaps,
its successes.
"Such a
threat must be primarily military in nature.
At present
there are three relatively hostile elements around Syria's
borders:
Consideration must be
given to orchestrating a credible military threat against
Syria in order to induce at least some moderate change in
its policies,"
Fuller explained in the document.
"This paper
proposes serious examination of the use of all three states
acting independently to exert the necessary threat. Use
of any one state in isolation cannot create such a credible
threat."
Syria is now a
landmine for the
Trump
administration
- as it has been in varying intensity for a lengthy succession
of presidents before.
To make proud
the neocon war-hawks ravenous to rain missiles upon Assad's
forces would duly emblazon the already blood-tinged U.S.
government as chief aggressor in a conflict that had been
nearing resolution - if not, ultimately, the catalyst for the
third world war.
To withdraw
militarily and negotiate a reasonable conclusion to the quagmire
in Syria, would mean admitting defeat in the removal of Assad - as well as a black eye from the propaganda-suckered who find
solace in the Western policy of killing people to teach people
killing people is wrong.
In fact, for
Trump and his ilk to save face over Syria and prevent the
increasing likelihood of
direct military conflict
with Russia seems an impossibility at this late hour.
In only the past
week, incessant drums of war reached a frenetic and dizzying
pace - met only by furious uproar over yet another theater of
war - despite Syria unofficially having been
precisely that
for the United States for decades.
