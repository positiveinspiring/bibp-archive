# Is It Fear of Uprisings or Altruistic Punishment?

As the uprisings are spreading around the world
and in the United States, there are many who feel fear, reticence and
intense skittishness about what is transpiring.
Yet, this anxiety, rather than surprising, is
well cultivated by the
contemporary hegemonic forces that govern our lives.
What is most important for us to understand is that we, as a people, are
most conditioned to fear when populations reclaim their social agency and
collective power and rise up against the unjust policies of the state. Here,
I am speaking of protests that are generally aimed against economic and
social policies of repression that are directly tied to the interests of the
powerful ruling class.
As much as U.S. rhetorics would like to pretend we are
a classless nation, such protests are forms of class struggle.
Moreover, as an educator, what I see is that the hegemonic pedagogy of the
West socializes us all to be self-centered individuals and to fear or hold
suspect communal life. Along with this, we are conditioned to fear "the
wrath" of the masses, if and when they should rise collectively to counter
the long-term political betrayal of our leaders.
This causes even good
liberals to worry incessantly about the dangers of mass protests.
This is partly because by the time people throw caution to the wind and
mount collective action on the street, they are responding not only from a
place of reason, but also from their emotions, their hearts.
The result is a
reclaiming of humanity and public space - both well domesticated and
controlled under contemporary Western rule - when the people finally refuse
to permit the oppressive forces of injustice to be reasoned away or for
repressive public policies to press upon our souls one more moment, without
responding.
No historical transformation has ever been possible without the
consolidation of the passion or Eros, as George Katsiaficas reminds us, of
the people on the streets, collectively directed with their reason toward
their pursuit of justice.
But we are also taught that to enter collectively
into this state of uprising is dangerous, for, in many instances, it may
result in violence with impunity by the state, in an effort to regain
control of public life.
What is often dismissed, as Paulo Freire reminds us in "Pedagogy of the
Oppressed,"
is that violence, more often than not, is initiated not by those
rebelling from oppression, but by those who refuse to step down or cede
their power when the people have called for change.
So, in many ways, we can
also think of uprisings that call for the ousting of government heads and
officials as forms of "altruistic punishment," a term used by
Stephen Hall
to speak of a collectively loving act of faith by the people, rightly
exercised with their,
"flesh and blood" for the greater good.
In Western societies with a heavy cultural emphasis on dispassionate reason
and unrelenting individualism, such values function to distort the inherent
communality that even neuroscientists now conclude is actually hardwired in
human beings for our collective survival.
However, Westerners, who often
have so much less to lose as compared to the people of Bahrain, for
instance, tend to be even more fearful of collective action, given their
deeply conditioned cultural belief that cool individual reason is superior
to passionate collective action. This misguided notion is reinforced by the
fact that mass action with stirred emotions is only considered legitimate in
the exercise of war, not democratic life.
Again, all this works well to temper mass action, particularly in the West.
Hence, it may not be easy for many to trust the
uprisings in Wisconsin and
around the world today, given deep, unexamined insecurities and fears,
intensified by a lack of faith in the people and an accompanying anxiety
that things could get or be worse.
That said, it should not be surprising
that the more disconnected a person or class may feel from the passion that
stirs the collective action of disenfranchised masses, the more concern they
are bound to express for their individual well-being.
Thus, as we have seen time and again, the privileged will attempt to use
their cool reason and social apparatus of wealth to separate themselves from
the collective action of the disenfranchised, who through their passionate
uprising threaten the privileges and entitlements, which the elite have
enjoyed undisturbed for so long.
What we should fear then is not the
uprising of the masses who call for justice, but the fearful reactionary and
violent responses of
the powerful when they realize that they cannot
effectively thwart the "altruistic punishment" of a people grown weary by
the impunity of political-economic oppression and a government's betrayal of
universal human rights.
