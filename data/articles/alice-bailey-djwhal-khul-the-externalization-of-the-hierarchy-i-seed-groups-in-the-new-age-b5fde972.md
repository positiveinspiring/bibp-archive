# Alice Bailey & Djwhal Khul - The Externalization of the Hierarchy - I - Seed
Groups in the New Age

I would remind you that such effort in the early stages (and
those stages are the present ones) results inevitably in the development of a critical
spirit through the intelligent effort being made and the discriminative recognition of
glamor in many cases, because only through such an effort can analysis of a right kind
eventually be achieved and criticism be eliminated. In the meantime, those thus in
training are oft a difficulty and a problem both to themselves and to their friends and
co-workers. But this phase is temporary and leads to a more lasting relationship and to
the emergence of that true magnetic link and love which must heal and lift and stimulate
all that it may contact.In the coming Aquarian Age we shall see humanity producing a
culture which is sensitive to the finer and higher spiritual values, a civilization which
is free from glamor and from much of the illusion which today colors the Aryan peoples,
and a racial life which will be embodied in those forms which will bridge the gap at
present existing; it will be free from what we now know as disease of the worst kind,
though death and certain forms of bodily breakdown which may eventually end in death will,
of course, still be prevalent. The overcoming of death is not contingent upon the [45]
elimination of bodily ills, but upon the establishing of that continuity of consciousness
which carries over from the physical plane of life to the inner subjective existence. Of
this state of being, groups such as this third group can be the custodian and their
problem is therefore:
- To establish that state of personality development which will lead to magnetic living
upon the physical plane.
- To study the laws of life, which are the laws of health and of right relationship.
- To develop that continuity of consciousness which will "open the doors of life and
dispel the fear of the known and of that which disappears."
From the angle of the work of the world healers, the above is a statement of
opportunity. This they face as the nucleus or one of the germs or seeds of the new
civilization and the coming culture. It embodies the objective of all their work, and
their contribution to the united work of the groups.
Equally so, they can bridge the gap at present existing in the racial consciousness
between
- Life and death.
- The sick and the well. This is between
- The physically sick and the inwardly well, which is the case with a few - a very few -
of the advanced people, or the disciples of the world and the senior aspirants.
- The physically well and the psychically sick, which is sometimes the case, but of
singular rarity.
- The physically sick, the psychologically sick, and the over-shadowing soul. This
situation is often found today.
- The physical plane and the world of souls, because of the development of a sound
instrument and the dissipation of those causes which work out as effects in the physical
body as disease, and act as barriers to the inflow of soul energy and the entrance of soul
awareness into the brain activity. [46]
This bridging work, when it occurs today, is often simply a fortunate but fortuitous
happening and is not the result of a consciously planned bridging work. But it is the
intent of the Hierarchy that the groups which will be later formed, and which are today in
process of forming (including this third group of mine) can aid in this process, if such
is the will of the constituent parts.
Finally, every initiate is a magnetic healer. This is a statement of fact. Though the
members of the Hierarchy have each of Them Their duly appointed functions and Their
planned activity (dependent upon Ray, upon race and upon dedication) there is one activity
which They share in common and that is the power to heal. Their ability to act as magnetic
healers works out in various ways, predominantly in the realm of psychological
readjustments and psychic disentanglements, and - only incidentally and as a result of the
two above activities - in the processes of bodily healing. You will note from the above,
that the healing work done by the initiate members of the Great White Lodge is threefold -
psychological, bringing in the soul; psychic, releasing the lower psychic
nature from illusion so that the psyche or soul can have full sway; physical, as
the result of the inner psychological and psychic adjustments.
This triple healing activity is intended to be the objective of all groups working as
this third group, the magnetic healers, should work; thus will be brought about an
emergence of hierarchical effort into outer activity. Thus you will note, my brother, that
the work of the first three groups just discussed, and viewing them as constituting one
unit, produces a synthetic endeavor in the three worlds, and leads from the plane of the
soul to the plane of outer expression.
