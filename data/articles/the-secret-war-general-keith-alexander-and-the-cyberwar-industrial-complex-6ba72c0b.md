INFILTRATION.
SABOTAGE. MAYHEM.
FOR YEARS FOUR-STAR GENERAL
KEITH ALEXANDER
HAS BEEN BUILDING A SECRET
ARMY
CAPABLE OF LAUNCHING
DEVASTATING CYBER-ATTACKS.
NOW ITS READY TO UNLEASH
HELL.
Inside Fort Meade, Maryland, a top-secret city
bustles. Tens of thousands of people move through more than 50 buildings -
the city has its own post office, fire department, and police force.
But as if designed by Kafka, it sits among a
forest of trees, surrounded by electrified fences and heavily armed guards,
protected by antitank barriers, monitored by sensitive motion detectors, and
watched by rotating cameras.
To block any telltale electromagnetic signals
from escaping, the inner walls of the buildings are wrapped in protective
copper shielding and the one-way windows are embedded with a fine copper
mesh.
This is the undisputed domain of General
Keith Alexander, a man few even in
Washington would likely recognize.
Never before has anyone in Americas
intelligence sphere come close to his degree of power, the number of people
under his command, the expanse of his rule, the length of his reign, or the
depth of his secrecy.
A four-star Army general, his authority extends
across three domains.
He is,
As such, he has his own secret military,
presiding over the Navys 10th Fleet, the 24th Air
Force, and the Second Army.
Alexander runs the nations cyberwar efforts, an
empire he has built over the past eight years by insisting that the USs
inherent vulnerability to digital attacks requires him to amass more and
more authority over the data zipping around the globe.
In his telling, the threat is so mind-bogglingly
huge that the nation has little option but to eventually put the entire
civilian Internet under his protection, requiring tweets and emails to pass
through his filters, and putting the kill switch under the governments
forefinger.
What we see is an increasing level of
activity on the networks, he said at a recent security conference in
Canada.
I am concerned that this is going to break
a threshold where the private sector can no longer handle it and the
government is going to have to step in.
In its tightly controlled public relations, the
NSA has focused attention on the threat of cyberattack against the US:
-
the vulnerability of critical
infrastructure like power plants and water systems
-
the susceptibility of the militarys
command and control structure
-
the dependence of the economy on the
Internets smooth functioning
Defense against these threats was the paramount
mission trumpeted by NSA brass at congressional hearings and hashed over at
security conferences.
But there is a flip side to this equation that is rarely mentioned:
The military has for years been developing
offensive capabilities, giving it the power not just to defend the US
but to assail its foes.
Using so-called cyber-kinetic attacks, Alexander
and his forces now have the capability to physically destroy an adversarys
equipment and infrastructure, and potentially even to kill.
Alexander - who declined to be interviewed for
this article - has concluded that such cyberweapons are as crucial to 21st-century
warfare as nuclear arms were in the 20th. And he and his
cyberwarriors have already launched their first attack.
The cyberweapon that came to be known as
Stuxnet was created and built by
the NSA
in partnership with
the CIA and Israeli intelligence in the
mid-2000s. The first known piece of malware designed to destroy physical
equipment, Stuxnet was aimed at Irans nuclear facility in Natanz.
By surreptitiously taking control of an
industrial control link known as a Scada (Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition) system, the sophisticated worm was able to damage about a
thousand centrifuges used to enrich nuclear material.
The success of this sabotage came to light only in June 2010, when the
malware spread to outside computers. It was spotted by independent security
researchers, who identified telltale signs that the worm was the work of
thousands of hours of professional development. Despite headlines around the
globe, officials in Washington have never openly acknowledged that the US
was behind the attack.
It wasnt until 2012 that anonymous sources
within the Obama administration took credit for it in interviews with The
New York Times.
But Stuxnet is only the beginning. Alexanders agency has recruited
thousands of computer experts, hackers, and engineering PhDs to expand US
offensive capabilities in the digital realm.
The Pentagon has requested $4.7 billion for
cyberspace operations, even as the budget of the CIA and other
intelligence agencies could fall by $4.4 billion. It is pouring millions
into cyberdefense contractors.
And more attacks may be planned.
Inside the government, the general is regarded
with a mixture of respect and fear, not unlike J. Edgar Hoover, another
security figure whose tenure spanned multiple presidencies.
We jokingly referred to him as Emperor
Alexander - with good cause, because whatever Keith wants, Keith gets,
says one former senior CIA official who agreed to speak on condition of
anonymity.
We would sit back literally in awe of what
he was able to get from Congress, from the White House, and at the
expense of everybody else.
Now 61, Alexander has said he plans to retire in
2014; when he does step down he will leave behind an enduring legacy - a
position of far-reaching authority and potentially Strangelovian powers at a
time when the distinction between cyberwarfare and conventional warfare is
beginning to blur.
A recent Pentagon report made that point in
dramatic terms.
It recommended possible deterrents to a
cyberattack on the US. Among the options:
launching nuclear weapons.
He may be a four-star Army general, but Alexander more closely resembles a
head librarian than George Patton.
His face is anemic, his lips a neutral
horizontal line. Bald halfway back, he has hair the color of strong tea that
turns gray on the sides, where it is cut close to the skin, more schoolboy
than boot camp. For a time he wore large rimless glasses that seemed to
swallow his eyes.
Some combat types had a derisive nickname for
him: Alexander the Geek.
Born in 1951, the third of five children, Alexander was raised in the small
upstate New York hamlet of Onondaga Hill, a suburb of Syracuse. He tossed
papers for the Syracuse Post-Standard and ran track at Westhill High School
while his father, a former Marine private, was involved in local Republican
politics.
It was 1970, Richard Nixon was president,
and most of the country had by then begun to see the war in Vietnam as a
disaster.
But Alexander had been accepted at West Point, joining a class
that included two other future four-star generals, David Petraeus and Martin
Dempsey. Alexander would never get the chance to serve in Vietnam.
Just as he stepped off the bus at West Point,
the ground war finally began winding down.
In April 1974, just before graduation, he married his high school classmate
Deborah Lynn Douglas, who grew up two doors away in Onondaga Hill. The
fighting in Vietnam was over, but the Cold War was still bubbling, and
Alexander focused his career on the solitary, rarefied world of signals
intelligence, bouncing from secret NSA base to secret NSA base, mostly in
the US and Germany.
He proved a competent administrator, carrying
out assignments and adapting to the rapidly changing high tech environment.
Along the way he picked up masters degrees in electronic warfare, physics,
national security strategy, and business administration.
As a result, he quickly rose up the military
intelligence ranks, where expertise in advanced technology was at a premium.
In 2001, Alexander was a one-star general in charge of the Army Intelligence
and Security Command, the militarys worldwide network of 10,700 spies and
eavesdroppers.
In March of that year he told his hometown
Syracuse newspaper that his job was to discover threats to the country.
We have to stay out in front of our
adversary, Alexander said. Its a chess game, and you dont want to
lose this one.
But just six months later, Alexander and the
rest of the American intelligence community suffered a devastating defeat
when they were 'surprised' by
the
attacks on 9/11.
Following the assault, he ordered his Army
intercept operators to begin illegally monitoring the phone calls and email
of American citizens who had nothing to do with terrorism, including
intimate calls between journalists and their spouses.
Congress later gave retroactive immunity to the
telecoms that assisted the government.
In 2003 Alexander, a favorite of defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld,
was named the Armys deputy chief of staff for intelligence, the services
most senior intelligence position. Among the units under his command were
the military intelligence teams involved in the human rights abuses at
Baghdads Abu Ghraib prison.
Two years later, Rumsfeld appointed Alexander -
now a three-star general - director of the NSA, where he oversaw the
illegal, warrantless wiretapping program while deceiving members of the
House Intelligence Committee.
In a publicly released letter to Alexander
shortly after
The New York Times exposed the program, US
representative Rush Holt, a member of the committee, angrily took him
to task for not being forthcoming about the wiretapping:
Your responses make a mockery of
congressional oversight.
Alexander also proved to be militant about
secrecy.
In 2005 a senior agency employee named Thomas
Drake allegedly gave information to The Baltimore Sun showing that a
publicly discussed program known as Trailblazer was millions of dollars
overbudget, behind schedule, possibly illegal, and a serious threat to
privacy.
In response, federal prosecutors charged Drake
with 10 felony counts, including retaining classified documents and making
false statements.
He faced up to 35 years in prison - despite the
fact that all of the information Drake was alleged to have leaked was not
only unclassified and already in the public domain but in fact had been
placed there by NSA and Pentagon officials themselves.
Note: As a longtime chronicler
of the NSA, I served as a consultant for Drakes defense team.
The
investigation went on for four years, after which Drake received no jail
time or fine. The judge, Richard D. Bennett, excoriated the prosecutor and NSA officials for dragging their feet.
I find that unconscionable.
Unconscionable, he said during a hearing in 2011. Thats four years of
hell that a citizen goes through. It was not proper. It doesnt pass the
smell test.
But while
the
powers that be were pressing for Drakes imprisonment, a much
more serious challenge was emerging.
Stuxnet, the cyberweapon used to attack the
Iranian facility in Natanz, was supposed to be untraceable, leaving no
return address should the Iranians discover it. Citing anonymous Obama
administration officials, The New York Times reported that the malware began
replicating itself and migrating to computers in other countries.
Cybersecurity detectives were thus able to detect and analyze it.
By the summer of 2010 some were pointing fingers
at the US.
Natanz is a small, dusty town in central Iran known for its plump pears and
the burial vault of the 13th-century Sufi sheikh Abd al-Samad.
The Natanz nuclear enrichment plant is a vault of a different kind. Tucked
in the shadows of the Karkas Mountains, most of it lies deep underground and
surrounded by concrete walls 8 feet thick, with another layer of concrete
for added security. Its bulbous concrete roof rests beneath more than 70
feet of packed earth.
Contained within the bombproof structure are
halls the size of soccer pitches, designed to hold thousands of tall, narrow
centrifuges. The machines are linked in long cascades that look like tacky
decorations from a 70s discotheque.
To work properly, the centrifuges need strong, lightweight, well-balanced
rotors and high-speed bearings. Spin these rotors too slowly and the
critical U-235 molecules inside fail to separate; spin them too quickly and
the machines self-destruct and may even explode.
The operation is so
delicate that the computers controlling the rotors movement are isolated
from the Internet by a so-called air gap that prevents exposure to viruses
and other malware.
In 2006, the Department of Defense gave the go-ahead to the NSA to begin
work on targeting these centrifuges, according to The New York Times.
One of the first steps was to build a map of the
Iranian nuclear facilitys computer networks. A group of hackers known as
Tailored Access Operations - a highly secret organization within the NSA -
took up the challenge.
They set about remotely penetrating communications systems and networks,
stealing passwords and data by the terabyte. Teams of vulnerability
analysts searched hundreds of computers and servers for security holes,
according to a former senior CIA official involved in the Stuxnet program.
Armed with that intelligence, so-called network
exploitation specialists then developed software implants known as beacons,
which worked like surveillance drones, mapping out a blueprint of the
network and then secretly communicating the data back to the NSA. (Flame,
the complex piece of surveillance malware discovered by Russian
cybersecurity experts last year, was likely one such beacon.)
The surveillance drones worked brilliantly. The
NSA was able to extract data about the Iranian networks, listen to and
record conversations through computer microphones, even reach into the
mobile phones of anyone within Bluetooth range of a compromised machine.
The next step was to create a digital warhead, a task that fell to the CIA
Clandestine Services Counter-Proliferation Division.
According to the senior CIA official, much of
this work was outsourced to national labs, notably Sandia in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. So by the mid-2000s, the government had developed all the
fundamental technology it needed for an attack.
But there was still a major problem:
The secretive agencies had to find a way to
access Irans most sensitive and secure computers, the ones protected by
the air gap. For that, Alexander and his fellow spies would need outside
help.
This is where things get murky.
One possible bread crumb trail leads to an
Iranian electronics and computer wholesaler named Ali Ashtari, who
later confessed that he was recruited as a spy by the Mossad, Israels
intelligence service. (Israel denied the claim.)
Ashtaris principal
customers were the procurement officers for some of Irans most sensitive
organizations, including the intelligence service and the nuclear enrichment
plants.
If new computers were needed or routers or
switches had to be replaced, Ashtari was the man to see, according to
reports from semi-official Iranian news agencies and an account of Ashtaris
trial published by the nonprofit Iran Human Rights Voice.
He not only had access to some of Irans most
sensitive locations, his company had become an electronics purchasing agent
for the intelligence, defense, and nuclear development departments.
This would have given Mossad enormous
opportunities to place worms, back doors, and other malware into the
equipment in a wide variety of facilities. Although the Iranians have never
explicitly acknowledged it, it stands to reason that this could have been
one of the ways Stuxnet got across the air gap.
But by then, Iran had established a new counterintelligence agency dedicated
to discovering nuclear spies. Ashtari was likely on their radar because of
the increased frequency of his visits to various sensitive locations.
He may have let down his guard.
The majority of people we lose as sources -
who get wrapped up or executed or imprisoned - are usually those willing
to accept more risk than they should, says the senior CIA official
involved with Stuxnet.
In 2006, according to Iran Human Rights Voice,
Ashtari was quietly arrested at a travel agency after returning from another
trip out of the country.
The malware targeting Iran replicated and spread to computers in other
countries
In June 2008 he was brought to trial in Branch 15 of the Revolutionary
Court, where he confessed, pleaded guilty to the charges, expressed remorse
for his actions, and was sentenced to death. On the morning of November 17,
in the courtyard of Tehrans Evin Prison, a noose was placed around
Ashtaris neck, and a crane hauled his struggling body high into the air.
Ashtari may well have been one of the human assets that allowed Stuxnet to
cross the air gap.
But he was not Israels only alleged spy in
Iran, and others may also have helped enable malware transfer.
Normally, says the anonymous CIA official,
what we do is look for multiple bridges, in case a guy gets wrapped
up.
Less then two weeks after Ashtaris execution,
the Iranian government arrested three more men, charging them with spying
for Israel.
And on December 13, 2008, Ali-Akbar Siadat,
another importer of electronic goods, was arrested as a spy for the Mossad,
according to Irans official Islamic Republic News Agency.
Unlike Ashtari, who said he had operated alone,
Siadat was accused of heading a nationwide spy network employing numerous
Iranian agents. But despite their energetic counterintelligence work, the
Iranians would not realize for another year and a half that a cyberweapon
was targeting their nuclear centrifuges.
Once they did, it was only a matter of time
until they responded.
Sure enough, in August 2012 a devastating virus was unleashed on Saudi
Aramco, the giant Saudi state-owned energy company. The malware infected
30,000 computers, erasing three-quarters of the companys stored data,
destroying everything from documents to email to spreadsheets and leaving in
their place an image of a burning American flag, according to The New York
Times.
Just days later, another large cyberattack hit
RasGas, the giant Qatari natural gas company. Then a series of
denial-of-service attacks took Americas largest financial institutions
offline.
Experts blamed all of this activity on Iran,
which had created its own cyber command in the wake of the US-led attacks.
James Clapper, US director of national
intelligence, for the first time declared cyberthreats the greatest danger
facing the nation, bumping terrorism down to second place. In May, the
Department of Homeland Securitys Industrial Control Systems Cyber
Emergency Response Team issued a vague warning that US energy and
infrastructure companies should be on the alert for cyberattacks.
It was widely reported that this warning came
in response to Iranian cyberprobes of industrial control systems.
An Iranian diplomat denied any involvement.
The cat-and-mouse game could escalate.
Its a trajectory, says James Lewis, a
cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. The general consensus is that a cyber response alone is pretty
worthless. And nobody wants a real war.
Under international law, Iran may have the right
to self-defense when hit with destructive cyberattacks.
William Lynn, deputy secretary of
defense, laid claim to the prerogative of self-defense when he outlined the
Pentagons cyber operations strategy.
The United States reserves the right, he
said, under the laws of armed conflict, to respond to serious
cyberattacks with a proportional and justified military response at the
time and place of our choosing.
Leon Panetta, the former CIA chief who
had helped launch the Stuxnet offensive, would later point to Irans
retaliation as a troubling harbinger.
The collective result of these kinds of
attacks could be a cyber Pearl Harbor, he warned in October 2012,
toward the end of his tenure as defense secretary, an attack that would
cause physical destruction and the loss of life.
If Stuxnet was the proof of concept, it also
proved that one successful cyberattack begets another. For Alexander, this
offered the perfect justification for expanding his empire.
In May 2010, a little more than a year after
President
Obama took office
and only weeks before Stuxnet became public, a new organization to exercise
American rule over the increasingly militarized Internet became operational:
the US Cyber Command.
Keith Alexander, newly promoted to four-star
general, was put in charge of it.
The forces under his command were now truly
formidable - his untold thousands of NSA spies, as well as 14,000 incoming
Cyber Command personnel, including Navy, Army, and Air Force troops.
Helping Alexander organize and dominate this new
arena would be his fellow plebes from West Points class of 1974:
-
David Petraeus, the CIA director
-
Martin Dempsey, chair of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff
Indeed, dominance has long been their watchword.
Alexanders Navy calls itself the Information
Dominance Corps. In 2007, the then secretary of the Air Force pledged to
dominate cyberspace just as today, we dominate air and space.
And Alexanders Army warned,
It is in cyberspace that we must use our
strategic vision to dominate the information environment.
The Army is reportedly treating digital weapons
as another form of offensive capability, providing frontline troops with the
option of requesting cyber fire support from Cyber Command in the same way
they request air and artillery support.
All these capabilities require a giant expansion of secret facilities.
Thousands of hard-hatted construction workers
will soon begin erecting cranes, driving backhoes, and emptying cement
trucks as they expand the boundaries of NSAs secret city eastward,
increasing its already enormous size by a third.
You could tell that some of the seniors at
NSA were truly concerned that cyber was going to engulf them, says a
former senior Cyber Command official, and I think rightfully so.
In May, work began on a
$3.2
billion facility housed at Fort Meade in Maryland.
Known as Site M, the 227-acre complex includes
its own 150-megawatt power substation, 14 administrative buildings, 10
parking garages, and chiller and boiler plants. The server building will
have 90,000 square feet of raised floor - handy for supercomputers - yet
hold only 50 people.
Meanwhile, the 531,000-square-foot operations
center will house more than 1,300 people. In all, the buildings will have a
footprint of 1.8 million square feet. Even more ambitious plans, known as
Phase II and III, are on the drawing board.
Stretching over the next 16 years, they would
quadruple the footprint to 5.8 million square feet, enough for nearly 60
buildings and 40 parking garages, costing $5.2 billion and accommodating
11,000 more cyberwarriors.
In short, despite the sequestration, layoffs, and furloughs in the federal
government, its a boom time for Alexander.
In April, as part of its 2014 budget request,
the Pentagon asked Congress for $4.7 billion for increased cyberspace
operations, nearly $1 billion more than the 2013 allocation. At the same
time, budgets for the CIA and other intelligence agencies were cut by almost
the same amount, $4.4 billion. A portion of the money going to Alexander
will be used to create 13 cyberattack teams.
Whats good for Alexander is good for the fortunes of the
cyber-industrial complex, a burgeoning sector made up of many of the
same defense contractors who grew rich supplying the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
With those conflicts now mostly in the rearview
mirror, they are looking to Alexander as a kind of savior. After all, the US
spends about $30 billion annually on cybersecurity goods and services.
In the past few years, the contractors have embarked on their own cyber
building binge parallel to the construction boom at Fort Meade:
-
General Dynamics opened a
28,000-square-foot facility near the NSA
-
SAIC cut the ribbon on its new
seven-story Cyber Innovation Center
-
the giant
CSC unveiled its Virtual Cyber
Security Center
And at consulting firm
Booz Allen Hamilton, where former NSA
director Mike McConnell was hired to lead the cyber effort, the
company announced a cyber-solutions network that linked together nine
cyber-focused facilities. Not to be outdone, Boeing built a new Cyber
Engagement Center.
Leaving nothing to chance, it also hired retired
Army major general Barbara Fast, an old friend of Alexanders, to run
the operation. (She has since moved on.)
Defense contractors have been eager to prove that they understand
Alexanders worldview.
Our Raytheon cyberwarriors play offense and
defense, says one help-wanted site.
Consulting and engineering firms such as
Invertix and Parsons are among dozens posting online want ads for computer
network exploitation specialists.
And many other companies, some unidentified, are
seeking computer and network attackers.
Firm is seeking computer network attack
specialists for long-term government contract in King George County,
VA, one recent ad read.
Another, from Sunera, a Tampa, Florida, company,
said it was hunting for attack and penetration consultants.
One of the most secretive of these contractors is
Endgame Systems, a startup backed by VCs
including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Bessemer Venture Partners, and
Paladin Capital Group.
Established in Atlanta in 2008, Endgame is
transparently antitransparent.
Weve been very careful not to have a
public face on our company, former vice president John M. Farrell wrote
to a business associate in an email that appeared in a WikiLeaks dump.
We dont ever want to see our name in a
press release, added founder Christopher Rouland.
True to form, the company declined Wireds
interview requests.
Perhaps for good reason:
According to news reports, Endgame is
developing ways to break into Internet-connected devices through chinks
in their antivirus armor.
Like safecrackers listening to the click of
tumblers through a stethoscope, the vulnerability researchers use an
extensive array of digital tools to search for hidden weaknesses in commonly
used programs and systems, such as Windows and Internet Explorer.
And since no one else has ever discovered these
unseen cracks, the manufacturers have never developed patches for them.
Thus, in the parlance of the trade, these
vulnerabilities are known as zero-day exploits, because it has been zero
days since they have been uncovered and fixed. They are the Achilles heel
of the security business, says a former senior intelligence official
involved with cyberwarfare.
Those seeking to break into networks and
computers are willing to pay millions of dollars to obtain them.
According to Defense News C4ISR Journal and Bloomberg
Businessweek, Endgame also offers its intelligence clients - agencies
like Cyber Command, the NSA, the CIA, and British intelligence - a unique
map showing them exactly where their targets are located.
Dubbed Bonesaw, the map displays the
geolocation and digital address of basically every device connected to the
Internet around the world, providing whats called network situational
awareness.
The client locates a region on the
password-protected web-based map, then picks a country and city - say,
Beijing, China. Next the client types in the name of the target
organization, such as the Ministry of Public Securitys No. 3 Research
Institute, which is responsible for computer security - or simply enters its
address, 6 Zhengyi Road.
The map will then display what software is
running on the computers inside the facility, what types of malware some may
contain, and a menu of custom-designed exploits that can be used to secretly
gain entry.
It can also pinpoint those devices infected with
malware, such as the
Conficker worm, as well as networks turned
into botnets and zombies - the equivalent of a back door left open.
Bonesaw also contains targeting data on US allies, and it is soon to
be upgraded with a new version codenamed Velocity, according to C4ISR
Journal. It will allow Endgames clients to observe in real time as hardware
and software connected to the Internet around the world is added, removed,
or changed.
But such access doesnt come cheap. One leaked
report indicated that annual subscriptions could run as high as $2.5 million
for 25 zero-day exploits.
The buying and using of such a subscription by nation-states could be seen
as an act of war.
If you are engaged in reconnaissance on an
adversarys systems, you are laying the electronic battlefield and
preparing to use it, wrote Mike Jacobs, a former NSA director for
information assurance, in a McAfee report on cyberwarfare.
In my opinion, these activities constitute
acts of war, or at least a prelude to future acts of war.
The question is, who else is on the secretive
companys client list?
Because there is as of yet no oversight or
regulation of the cyberweapons trade, companies in the cyber-industrial
complex are free to sell to whomever they wish.
It should be illegal, says the former
senior intelligence official involved in cyberwarfare. I knew about
Endgame when I was in intelligence. The intelligence community didnt
like it, but theyre the largest consumer of that business.
Thus, in their willingness to pay top dollar for
more and better zero-day exploits, the spy agencies are helping drive a
lucrative, dangerous, and unregulated cyber arms race, one that has
developed its own gray and black markets.
The companies trading in this arena can sell
their wares to the highest bidder - be they frontmen for criminal hacking
groups or terrorist organizations or countries that bankroll terrorists,
such as Iran.
Ironically, having helped create the market in
zero-day exploits and then having launched the world into the era of
cyberwar, Alexander now says the possibility of zero-day exploits falling
into the wrong hands is his greatest worry.
He has reason to be concerned.
In May, Alexander discovered that four months
earlier someone, or some group or nation, had secretly hacked into a
restricted US government database known as the National Inventory of Dams.
Maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, it lists the vulnerabilities for
the nations dams, including an estimate of the number of people who might
be killed should one of them fail.
Meanwhile, the 2013 Report
Card for Americas Infrastructure gave the US a 'D' on its
maintenance of dams. There are 13,991 dams in the US that are classified as
high-hazard, the report said.
A high-hazard dam is defined as one whose
failure would cause loss of life.
Thats our concern about whats coming in
cyberspace - a destructive element. It is a question of time, Alexander
said in a talk to a group involved in information operations and
cyberwarfare, noting that estimates put the time frame of an attack
within two to five years.
He made his comments in September 2011.
