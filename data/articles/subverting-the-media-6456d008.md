In discussing the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dan Rather, the
well-loved anchorman for CBS Television, described the now famous Zapruder
film that captured footage of the shot which killed President John F.
Kennedy.
The movie, taken by amateur cameraman, Abraham Zapruder, was
quickly snapped-up by Life magazine for $250,000.00. Although Life published
still frames of the movie, the 18 second film was kept under lock and key - not to be seen by Americans until 1975.
But Rathers remarks were misleading. He told his viewers that the film
showed JFK falling forward - confirming the official view that Kennedy had
been shot from behind. However, the film clearly showed Kennedy lurching
violently backwards, evidence of a frontal shot.
To add to the confusion,
the
Warren Commission report printed two frames of the film in reverse - again implying a rear shot - an accident the FBI typified as a printing
error.
Meanwhile, still pictures lifted from the Zapruder film were also published
by Life magazine. Remarkably, they too were published in reverse order,
thereby creating the impression that the President had been shot from behind
by lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. Until the film was shown to Americans in
its entirety, no one was the wiser.
Following the broadcast in 1975, a
massive controversy followed giving rise to ongoing allegations of
conspiracy.
The
Zapruder film clearly showed President Kennedy had also been shot from
the front.
The result immeasurably strengthened the charge - that had been
bubbling in the background - that the President had been assassinated as a
result of a well orchestrated conspiracy, and that this was covered-up to
protect the guilty, who many now believe involved senior figures in the CIA
and US military.
Not least it was pointed out that Henry Luce, the founder
of Life magazine was a close personal friend of Allen Dulles, the Director
of the CIA. Moreover, the individual who purchased the Zapruder film for
Life magazine was C.J. Jackson, formerly a psychological warfare
consultant to the President.
Inevitably, these events were to lead to accusations that the media were
culpable of the worst form of toadying and propaganda.
This, in turn raised
serious questions about the role and integrity of the mass media. Some years
later, Washington Post reporter, Carl Bernstein - who came to fame with his
colleague Bob Woodward, for their expose of the Nixon administrations
illegal re-election campaign activities, known as Watergate - dropped a
media bombshell on an unsuspecting America.
In an October 1977, article published by Rolling Stone magazine, Bernstein
reported that more than 400 American journalists worked for the CIA.
Bernstein went on to reveal that this cozy arrangement had covered the
preceding 25 years. Sources told Bernstein that the New York Times,
Americas most respected newspaper at the time, was one of the CIAs closest
media collaborators.
Seeking to spread the blame, the New York Times
published an article in December 1977, revealing that,
more than eight
hundred news and public information organizations and individuals, had
participated in the CIAs covert subversion of the media. One journalist is worth twenty agents, a high-level source told Bernstein.
Spies were trained as journalists and then later infiltrated
- often with
the publishers consent - into the most prestigious media outlets in America,
including the New York Times and Time Magazine.
Likewise, numerous reputable
journalists underwent training in various aspects of spook-craft by the
CIA. This included techniques as varied as secret writing, surveillance and
other spy crafts.
The subversion operation was orchestrated by Frank Wisner, an old CIA hand
whos clandestine activities dated back to WWII. Wisners media manipulation
program became known as the Wisner
(Mighty) Wurlitzer, and proved an effective
technique for sending journalists overseas to spy for the CIA.
Of the fifty
plus overseas news proprietarys owned by the CIA were The Rome Daily
American, The Manilla Times and the Bangkok Post.
Yet, according to some experts, there was another profound reason for the
CIAs close relations with the media. In his book, Virtual Government,
author
Alex Constantine
goes to some lengths to explore the birth and spread of
Operation Mockingbird.
This, Constantine explains, was a CIA project
designed to influence the major media for domestic propaganda purposes.
One
of the most important assets used by the CIAs Frank Wisner was Philip
Graham, publisher of the Washington Post. A decade later both Wisner and
Graham committed suicide - leading some to question the exact nature of
their deaths. More recently doubts have been cast on Wisners suicide
verdict by some observers who believed him to have been a Soviet agent.
Meanwhile, however, Wisner had,
implemented his plan and owned respected
members of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS and other communication
vehicles, plus stringers
,
...according to Deborah Davis in her biography of
Katharine Graham - wife of Philip Graham - and current publisher of the
Washington Post.
The operation was overseen by Allen Dulles, Director of
Central Intelligence.
Operation Mockingbird continued to flourish with CIA
agents boasting at having important assets inside every major news outlet
in the country. The list included such luminaries of the US media as,
-
Henry
Luce, publisher of Time Magazine
-
Arthur Hays Sulzberger, of the New York
Times
-
C.D. Jackson of Fortune Magazine,
...according to Constantine.
But there was another aspect to Mockingbird, Constantine reveals in an
Internet essay. Citing historian C. Vann Woodwards New York Times article
of 1987, Ronald Reagan, later to become President of the US, was a FBI
snitch earlier in his life. This dated back to the time when Reagan was
President of the Actors Guild.
Woodward says that Reagan,
fed the names of
suspect people in his organization to the FBI secretly and regularly enough
to be assigned an informers code number, T.10.
The purpose was to purge
the film industry of subversives.
As these stories hit the news, Senate investigators began to probe the CIA
sponsored manipulation of the media - the Fourth Estate that supposedly
was dedicated to acting as a check and balance on the excesses of the
executive.
This investigation was, however, curtailed at the insistence of
Central Intelligence Agency Directors, William Colby and George Bush - who
would later be elected US President. The information gathered by the Senate
Select Intelligence Committee chaired by Senator Frank Church, was
deliberately buried Bernstein reported.
Despite this suppression of evidence, information leaked out that revealed
the willing role of media executives to subvert their own industry.
Lets
not pick on some reporters, CIA Director William Colby stated during an
interview. Lets go to the managements. They were witting.
Bernstein
concluded that,
Americas leading publishers allowed themselves and their
news services to become handmaidens to the intelligence services.
Of the
household names that went along with this arrangement were:
-
Columbia
Broadcasting System
-
Copley News Service - which gave the CIA confidential
information on antiwar and black protestors
-
ABC TV
-
NBC
-
Associated Press
-
United Press International
-
Reuters
-
Newsweek
-
Time
-
Scripps-Howard
-
Hearst
Newspapers
-
the Miami Herald
Bernstein additionally stated that the two
most bullish media outlets to co-operate were the new York Times and CBS
Television. The New York Times even went so far as to submit stories to
Allen Dulles and his replacement, John McCone, to vet and approve before
publication.
Slowly, the role of Mockingbird in muzzling and manipulating the press began
to be revealed. In 1974, two former CIA agents, Victor Marchetti and John D.
Marks, published a sensational book entitled The CIA and the Cult of
Intelligence.
The book caused uproar for the many revelations it contained.
Included amongst them was the fact that the, until then, widely respected
Encounter magazine was indirectly funded by the CIA. The vehicle used to
covertly transfer funds to Encounter and many other publications, was the
Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF) a CIA front.
A decade earlier, in 1965,
the CCF was renamed Forum World Features (FWF) and purchased by Kern House
Enterprises, under the direction of John Hay Whitney, publisher of the
International Herald Tribune and former US Ambassador to the United Kingdom.
The Chairman of Forum World Features was Brian Crozier, who resigned his
position shortly before the explosive book went on sale. Crozier, a former
Economist journalist, was a contact of Britains Secret Intelligence
Service (MI6).
His employment to head up the CIA financed Forum World
Features in 1965, caused a row with MI6 who felt the CIA had breached the
secret agreement between the UK and USA by recruiting one of their own
assets.
Croziers media style was more discrete than Mockingbird. He preferred, when
possible, to insert his pre-spun propaganda stories to unwitting members of
the media, who would reprint them unaware of the bias they contained.
In
time, Crozier would go on to head up a shadowy anti subversive and dirty
tricks group called the 61, that sought to counter communist propaganda.
Another group of which he was a member was the
Pinay Cercle - a right wing Atlanticist group funded by the CIA - that claimed credit for getting
Margaret Thatcher elected as British Prime Minister.
Another propaganda operation, run from Lisburn barracks in Northern Ireland,
and under nominal British Army control, participated in extensive media
manipulation around the same time. Known as Clockwork Orange this involved
the construction of propaganda material designed to discredit prominent
members of the then Labour government as well as some in the Conservative
shadow cabinet.
Especially targeted was then Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
Clockwork Orange relied heavily on forged documents that would be given to
selected journalists for publication. Many of these forgeries sought to
demonstrate secret communist ties - or east bloc intelligence affiliations - amongst high profile politicians.
The aim was to destabilize Wilson and the Labour government by falsely
showing them to be soft on communism or even pro communist.
This operation
clearly favored a right wing Conservative administration under the
leadership of Mrs. Thatcher. In the event, Wilson resigned, said to have
been sickened by the numerous personal snipe attacks against him. During the
time he was under siege, Wilson experienced numerous break-ins at his
office, as well as having his phone lines tapped - courtesy of unnamed
officials in the security service, it is believed.
By 1979 the Conservative
party was returned to power.
Yet, with the demise of the cold war the motive for media propaganda has
collapsed. Or has it?
James Lilly, former Director of Operations at the CIA
later became Director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute
- a think tank heavily staffed by former intelligence types.
Lilly, in giving testimony to a Senate committee
during 1996 observed:
Journalists, I think, you dont recruit
them. We cant do that. Theyve told us not to do that. But you
certainly sit down with your journalists, and Ive done this and the
Station Chief has done it, others have done it
But even as the cold war rationale for
subverting the media recedes into the distance, press manipulation continues
anon.
A classified CIA report surfaced in 1992, that
revealed the Agencys public affairs office,
has relationships with reporters from
every major wire service, newspaper, news weekly, and television network
in the nation. The report added that the benefits of these continued
contacts had been fruitful to the CIA by turning Intelligence failure
stories into intelligence success stories
Basking in a glow of self satisfaction, the
report continued In many cases, we have persuaded reporters to postpone,
change, hold or even scrap stories that could have adversely affected
national security interests.
But the last word goes to
Noam Chomsky. A Professor of Linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomsky has extensively investigated
the role of todays media. His analysis is un-nerving.
The democratic postulate, Chomsky says,
is that the media are independent and
committed to discovering and reporting the truth
Despite this axiom, Chomsky finds that the media
supports,
established power and is responsive to the needs of government
and major power groups.
He additionally argues that the media is a
mechanism for pervasive thought control of elite interests and that
ordinary citizens need to,
undertake a course of intellectual self-defense
to protect themselves from manipulation and control
The covert role of the media has now apparently
shifted its focus.
One time expediter of the cold war, it now clamors for
the extension of corporate power.
Was the CIA behind Thatchers election?
Brian Croziers protégé was Robert Moss - a speech writer for Margaret
Thatcher. It was Moss who wrote Thatchers now famous speech The Sovietization of Britain that resulted in her being nick-named the Iron
Lady.
It was Thatchers strident anti-communism and laissez faire free
market economic policies that made her so attractive to powerful right
wingers in the Conservative party, and ensured her election as Conservative
leader.
Moss, received much of his inspiration from Cord Meyer,
Jr., the
London CIA Station Chief -and long time expert in covert operations.
Additional input to Moss came from the CIAs Miles Copeland, formerly the
head of the CIAs Gaming Room in Langley, Virginia.
The Gaming Room was
used to simulate covert actions prior to them being acted out for real.
Profile of Professor Noam Chomsky
Professor of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Noam
Chomsky is an internationally acclaimed, scholar, writer and political
activist who has extensively scrutinized the thorny subject of media
manipulation by elite and corporate interests.
His books Necessary
Illusions - Thought Control in Democratic Societies, and Manufacturing
Consent, co-authored with Edward Herman, are considered classics on the
subject.
Chomsky argues that the role of money and elite interests continue
to undermine a meaningful society.
Professor Chomskys views will be
expounded more fully in an exclusive interview to be published in a
forthcoming issue of The X Factor.
The CIA use of the media to undermine Chile
In his expose of the CIAs subversion of the media, reporter Carl Bernstein
outlined how Chiles socialist Prime Minister, Salvador Allende, was brought
to ruin by a CIA sponsored media campaign.
According to Bernstein, one of
the Agencys most valuable media assets was Hal Hendrix, the Miami News
Latin American correspondent during the 1960s. Hendrix, who was known as
The Spook by his colleagues, was at the forefront of a CIA sponsored anti-Allende media campaign.
Other reporters sympathetic to the CIAs strategy,
funneled Agency funds to Allendes political foes, as well as writing anti
Allende propaganda for CIA controlled newspapers.
The entire get Allende
campaign was orchestrated by the Nixon White House which was under pressure
from major US corporations like Coca Cola and IT&T to keep Allende from
taking power.
Journalists and corporate suppression of the news
Professor Noam Chomsky, and his co-author Edward Herman, in their book
Manufacturing Consent, have gone to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate
how media censorship operates.
Self censorship, the authors maintain,
largely results from a set of filters inculcated into the very heart of
journalism, that Chomsky and Herman call the Propaganda model. The first
of these filters the authors maintain, arises from corporate ownership
primarily resulting in the mass media being beholden to profit
orientation.
The argument is that the largest media enterprises are now
owned not just by one or two corporate entities, but by dozens of them - via
cross-ownership. Consequently, a given media outlet is less likely to bite
the hand that owns it.
The authors go on to cite a number of additional filters that operate behind
the scenes. These range from the power of advertisers through to the role
played by powerful pressure groups - for example the military - who work
hard to shape information in a favorable light. This is a clear example
and one that defence correspondents are all too aware of.
The Pentagon can
be a great aid to a defense journalist providing inside information and
other access. But this sort of co-operation and access is dependent on the
angle or spin that will appear in the resulting story. In other words the
article must meet with their approval. If, on the other hand, the story
attacks the military, co-operation is quickly pulled.
Other powerful
pressure groups operate in a similar fashion.
These include, for example,
the arms,
oil,
pharmaceutical,
farmers and brewing industries.
Today, barely any story reaches the media that hasnt been artfully packaged
by Public Relations gurus - retained for their ability to slant stories in
favor of their clients interests.
Television news regularly air news items
that use pre-shot footage supplied by corporate film wizards. In the past,
the fag-smoking, booze-guzzling archetypal reporter trudged the streets
tracking down a front-page story. Today, however, the media hound merely
cuts and pastes the contents of a freebie, pre-spun Press Pack - directly
to his computer Desk Top Publishing program.
In short, investigative
journalism has been replaced by a clubby merry go round of money spinning
splutter that regales the reader with carefully wrought stories fronting as
news items.
Rarely do the media cover seriously controversial subjects. During the heady
days of the Scott enquiry, few stories appeared that looked at the financing
of weapons to Iraq and Iran. A few journalists knew this was a major aspect
of the arms to Iraq affair, but how many newspapers revealed which British
banks had been up to their neck in weapons financing?
Corporate money has
massive clout and if you want to stay in business, as a journalist, you
dont rock the boat. By any measure this is self censorship.
Ask most journalists and they will chuckle and say it is not. Sure, some
stories are spiked - that is the nature of journalism. Spiked stories
generally result from legal reasons and constraints, media professionals
will tell you, but rarely result from direct action to suppress stories that
the public should learn about. Occasionally, a newspaper proprietor may step
in a kill a story for their own reasons.
These just as often end-up in the
pages of Private Eye, so little advantage ultimately accrues. At least that
is the rationale.
