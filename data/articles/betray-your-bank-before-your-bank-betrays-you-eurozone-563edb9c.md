Whats a Slovenian with several hundred thousand
euros in the bank supposed to do? Spread it out among at least a few
different banks, thats what. Or move the money out of the country, while
its still possible.
Imagine what must be on the minds of any savvy
depositors still left at
Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d., now 79 percent- owned by Slovenias
government. It was one of only four lenders in October that failed the
European Banking Authoritys latest capital-adequacy test, a ritual best
known for how lax its standards are.
One that
flunked was Bank of Cyprus Pcl, where uninsured depositors face 40
percent losses as part of the countrys bailout terms. Another was Cyprus
Popular Bank Pcl, also known as Laiki Bank, where uninsured deposits will
fare far worse and the bank is being shut.
Cypriot banks customers were complacent after
uninsured deposits went unscathed in,
-
Ireland
-
Greece
-
Spain
-
Portugal,
...the first Euro-Area countries to seek
international rescues. Slovenians wont have that excuse should their
country be next.
The former Yugoslav republic needs about 3
billion euros ($3.8 billion) of funding this year, while its struggling
banks need 1 billion euros of fresh capital, the
International Monetary Fund said last week.
Slovenias
central
bank this week urged the countrys new government to quickly carry out a
plan to recapitalize ailing lenders. Its a familiar pattern.
Oblivious Customers
The Central Bank of Cyprus
warned months ago that the countrys banks needed an infusion of 10
billion euros - which is more than half the size of the nations economy -
largely because of heavy losses on Greek sovereign debt held by Laiki and
Bank of Cyprus.
It seems a lot of customers were oblivious to
the banks deteriorating health, or were
confident they would be cared for by somebody else. The country is
getting a 10 billion-Euro bailout, nine months after it first asked for aid,
except none of the money will go to the banks.
Suddenly it should be dawning on a lot of
Europeans that deposit-guarantee limits matter.
In Slovenia, the
maximum is 100,000 euros per depositor, the
same as in Cyprus. (Deposit-insurance programs vary among the 17
countries that use the Euro.) For a few days last week, it looked as if
customers at Laiki and Bank of Cyprus would lose even some of their insured
deposits, which would have been a sacrilege.
That plan was scrapped, but could resurface
elsewhere for all we know should some genius at the German Finance Ministry
insist upon it. The one constant among bailouts of euro-area countries is
that there is no rhyme or reason, much less fairness, in the way many
details get worked out.
Cypriots may
bemoan the inequities of their
rough treatment, as might a bunch of wealthy Russians who mistook the
island for a reliable financial center and failed to
yank their money when they could. For the rest of Europe, the
implications should be obvious.
Anyone who leaves uninsured deposits in a
Euro-Area bank is on notice that their money can and will be taken from
them, if that is whats demanded by the troika of the IMF, the European
Commission and the European Central Bank.
Uninsured deposits arent riskless. Nor should
they be. Still, its unclear why the Euro-Areas central planners sought to
create a precedent that encourages capital flight from weak countries. This
could lead to more instability, not less.
So far, there have been no signs of a mass
exodus in countries such as Italy or Spain. But deposit migrations can
happen slowly, with lots of time passing before they appear in official
statistics.
Or maybe little will change and most bank
customers will go on believing it cant happen here, until one day it
does.
Restoring Normalcy
Much good might come from restoring some
semblance of normalcy to the hierarchy of creditors in banking. Even better
would be to see Germany try it for a change with its own zombie lenders,
such as Commerzbank AG (CBK), which is still partly government-owned after
its bailout in 2009.
The way its supposed to work at failing banks
is that shareholders get wiped out first.
Next the losses go up the ladder from junior
debt holders to senior bondholders, and then all the way to uninsured
depositors, if need be. Taxpayers and insured depositors shouldnt have to
absorb others losses or put money at risk to spare them. Troubled banks
should have to fend for themselves.
This was the approach imposed on Cyprus. In
ordinary circumstances, it would be considered fair. The best argument for
why it wasnt is that Cyprus had been lulled into believing it would be
treated just as well as Europes other bailout recipients. The entire
country got hooked on moral hazard.
Now Cyprus may be the template for the future,
regardless of European governments recent statements to the contrary.
If a bankrupt Euro-Area country cant afford to
recapitalize its own insolvent banks, it will have to bail in their owners
and creditors first as a condition of receiving outside aid. Or at least
thats what Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said this week
in an
outburst of candor, before later retracting the statement after it
triggered declines in European markets.
Wealthy depositors in Spain, Italy, Greece and
elsewhere should assume he was
speaking the truth the first time and take measures to protect their
money, rather than trusting governments to do it for them.
