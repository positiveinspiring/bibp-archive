> Source: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/Sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking238.htm

Dubai
Dubai has a premium banking sector that serves local, expatriate and
offshore clients.
It is said that the privacy policy for Dubai
banks is even better than that of Swiss banks. There are also no taxes
in this country. To open an account, you will first need to find what
the minimum balance is for each bank.
You will need to provide a copy of your
passport, a visit visa, proof of address, bank card from your country of
residence and maybe a letter of recommendation from a UAE resident.
Singapore
When you open an account in Singapore, you are investing in one of the
fastest-growing economies in the world, while at the same time
protecting your money and saving on taxes.
This country has the lowest tax rate in
Asia. The typical minimum required balance is $1,000. You need to have
your passport, proof of address, and maybe even your taxpayer number (SSN)
for your country of residence.
Accounts can be held in any currency, even
gold.
Hong Kong
Hong Kong has a strong banking infrastructure.
Banks do not require formal approval from
the government for opening accounts. The minimum balance is $3,000. To
open an account, you will need your passport, proof of address, and
possibly a reference letter from a banker.
Sovereign savings accounts in Hong Kong can
also be held in any currency including gold.
Switzerland
Swiss banks are best known for their strict privacy policies.
Since 1934, laws prevent bankers from
divulging any client account information. Only recently have US law
enforcement officers been permitted to get information in the course of
a criminal investigation (including tax evasion). Some accounts may be
opened with as little as $3,500.
You need to have a passport, recent utility
bill to establish residency, residence permit to set up an account.
Cayman Islands
The Cayman Islands have no direct taxation.
The minimum balance is usually $5,000 to
open an account. You will need a letter of reference from your home
banker and deposits cannot be made with cash, but with check, wire
transfer or bank draft.
You need proof of identity and a notarized
copy of your passport, character reference and any additional documents
requested by the bank.
