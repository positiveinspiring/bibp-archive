A brief history of
the Patriot Act, showing the many deceptions brought in
by the
Bush Administration, including:
requesting total secrecy form public
input and swapping at the last moment, the original Bill that Congress
agreed to sign, with one manipulated by the Administration.
The
Administration's version of the Bill contained unconstitutional provisions
that had been rejected earlier by Congress.
Regardless, Congress rushed to pass an, otherwise, unread Bill which sought
to greatly expand all federal law enforcement powers - far beyond their
intended means.
Hence, America would later discover that the Patriot Act had
little, if anything, to do with fighting the actual "war on terror" and much
more to do with bypassing the civil protections, granted under the US
Constitution.
