Much has been written about the past wars that
have been fought over oil (e.g. Gulf War 1), the wars that are presently
being fought over oil (e.g. Arab Spring) and the wars which will be fought
over oil (e.g. Syria and Iran).
What is missing from most conversations is that
the wars of the future will be fought over water, leaving oil as a secondary
consideration.
According to The United Nations research and scientific studies, nearly two-thirds of the
entire population inhabiting the planet will face severe, life-threatening
water shortages by the year 2025. The reasons most often cited for the water
shortages are waste and poor planning which will result in uneven
distribution.
Presently this problem is primarily a third
world problem.
However, the UN report and other ancillary reports mentions
that
England faces serious water shortages and the United States is not far
behind England. Even the Defense Intelligence Agency has clearly echoed
the dire warnings of the United Nations report by stating that unstable
water supplies will greatly impact all and water will subsequently be used
as weapon.
The DIA report evoked a reaction from Secretary
of State,
Hillary Clinton, as she
commented the DIAs findings are sobering and that as the worlds
population continues to expand, the demand for water will increase but fresh
water supplies will not keep pace.
Please note that the globalists never miss an
opportunity to promote the false paradigm of overpopulation in order to
justify their depopulation agenda. Clinton went on to comment that as water
shortages will lead to regional conflicts and violence between nation states
and within nation states.
One has to tip their hat to the globalists for
their dynamic and flexible approach to achieve total global domination.
As the world tires of the phony excuses to fight
the banker inspired wars over oil, the globalists have shifted their
strategy to appeal to human beings basic instinct, the inherent need to
possess food and water in order to survive.
...are nicely setting the table for what is to come; a
planned global water shortage which will follow these thinly veiled
justifications from these three intertwined globalist controlled entities.
In reality, the plan to bring the world to its
knees through
the global elites creation of artificial water shortages, is
already underway.
The reports from the DIA and the UN should be labeled
status reports, instead of futuristic projections. Consider the following
water-related facts from an existing set of realities. Twenty percent of the
worlds population, presently lacks access to an adequate supply of clean
drinking water.
Global water consumption is doubling every 20
years, more than twice the rate of human population growth.
The abovementioned facts can be exploited by the
globalists through controlling water supplies and creating more artificial
shortages. The globalist plan to bring the world to its knees by controlling
water is already bearing fruit as 31 countries currently face water
scarcity.
Globalist industries have been doing their part to ferment this
conspiracy as more than half the worlds major rivers are either dead or are
hopelessly polluted.
More evidence to support the notion that the
globalist plan is working is evidenced by the fact that, in third world
countries, water borne illnesses account for most deaths. Water safety
issues are being exacerbated and the death curve is dramatically spiking.
Tragically, these deaths are almost completely preventable.
As both the UN and DIA reports mention, that by
2025, two-thirds of the worlds population will live in absolute water
scarcity and accompanying
food shortages. There will no shortage of willing
and desperate soldiers to fight in the coming water wars.
The globalists plan for complete global
domination is brilliant. Their plan is incredibly evil due to the hundreds
of millions, if not billions, who will perish, but it is very brilliant.
Part one of this series,
demonstrated the first step of the plan which entails the loan sharking of
naive nations through banker manipulation and fraud.
Bolivia was the case in point as it defaulted on its
World Bank
obligations, their water supplies went into receivership, controlled by the
globalists, and prices skyrocketed by 400%.
This scheme is also underway in Lima, Peru,
where the typical poor family pays private vendors up to
$3 per cubic meter to collect contaminated water in buckets while the
elite pay 30 cents per cubic meter for treated water that pours out of taps
in their homes.
Also, in
India, some families spend a quarter of their income on water. Debt
manipulation, for the ultimate purpose of controlling water, is not just in
play in the third world.
The derivative debt has paralyzed the economies
of Europe and the United States. Debt default, followed by the banker
bailouts. How long will it be until the globalists have to bail out the
American economy while we continue on our trek towards unsustainable debt?
When Americas economy falters, the bankers, armed with their central bank
printing presses, will come to the rescue.
The price for their intervention, judging by
what happened in Bolivia, will be total control over our infrastructure.
Collecting rainwater and purifying stream water to drink, will become
illegal acts.
All water will be obtained through the public
private partnership corporations and you can bet, as history has set the
precedent, will get very expensive.
The DIA report prominently mentions that
agriculture uses
70% of the
worlds water supply. Therefore, it follows that water shortages will
quickly lead to food shortages. And what do the globalists see as the
solution to the resulting food crisis which will follow on the heels of the
contrived water shortages?
The globalists are using this opportunity to
promote drought resistant
GMO crops.
That is right, they are promoting GMOs on the
heels of artificially contrived water shortages!
So, if you dont die of
thirst or break the family budget by attempting to obtain water, you will
increasingly find yourself being poisoned by toxic, draught resistant GMOs.
These are the same GMOs, when examined in French longitudinal studies that
demonstrated that lab rats who consumed GMOs developed fatal tumors and
died.
Again, the brilliance of this plan is stunning
in which an artificial water shortage is created and the public will clamor
for GMO drought resistant crops.
The United States is also being pulled into this
unhealthy paradigm of an artificially contrived water shortage, through
outright theft, government assisted privatization and subsequent hording.
Some local American municipalities are already
experiencing similar rate increases which are common in the third world.
Just how this is being accomplished and what this means for the United
States, is the topic of Part 3 of this series (Americas
Water Supply Will Soon Become Slim Pickens).
