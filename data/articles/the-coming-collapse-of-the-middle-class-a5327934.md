Elizabeth Warren, Leo Gottlieb
Professor of Law at Harvard University, was chosen to be the 2007
speaker for the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Lecture series at UC
Berkeley.
She fears America is moving from a three class
society to a two class society.
She points out:
-
Men today make $800 less average income
than their fathers made in the 1970's
-
Savings as a percentage of personal
disposable income has gone from 11% to negative in the same time
period
-
Food, Clothing and Car prices all went
down
-
Yet the median family spends 76% more on
a mortgage compared to 30 years ago
-
A family who has employer sponsored
health insurance pays 74% more than a generation ago
Since the late 1990's, more children live in
homes that file for bankruptcy than live in homes that file for divorce. All
numbers have been adjusted for inflation.
Take your time with this video.
It's good.
