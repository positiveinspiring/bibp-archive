The "Internet of Things" just wouldnt be
"Internet" enough if Google was not involved in a major way.
Fortunately for those who have designed the
gadget spy system, however, Google is attempting to become heavily involved
in the implementation of yet another piece of the technological control
grid.
According to
The Information and
The Verge, Google is now testing thermostats connected to the Internet
that would allow users to view the amount of energy being consumed in their
homes as well as be able to make adjustments to that level of consumption.
At least that is the justification used to sell
the technology to the public...
The real reasons behind both Googles foray into
the relatively new field and those of other tech firms, governments, and
"sustainability"-related organizations are somewhat less interested in
consumer satisfaction, environmental health, and lower energy bills.
Googles latest foray into the control grid, a wide open country for the
corporate giant which never seems tired of pioneering new marketable
technological control products, is called
EnergySense.
This new program is round two for Google, which
attempted something similar a few years ago named Powermeter, although this
program was
terminated in mid-2011 due to "difficulties
scaling it up."
The mission statement for Powermeter, similar to
that of EnergySense,
"was that people could trim energy use by 15
percent if they could see what was happening."
Things are looking up for Google in this regard,
however, as Josh Lowensohn of The Verge writes that,
"This might be a better time
for such a service, as indicated by a rising wave of connected home
appliances. That includes Nest, which began with thermostats and has
since moved onto smoke detectors.
It's joined by a host of Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth-connected appliances that can pipe information to the cloud,
from refrigerators to web cameras."
Interestingly enough, Google Ventures
already invested in Nest in 2012.
Of course, if one is better able to monitor and observe the amount of energy
being used by a household or appliance, it stands to reason that one would
be better able to reduce and conserve the amount of energy he uses.
However, are we really expected to believe that,
The Verges Josh Lowensohn may be on to more
than he knows when he writes that,
"For Google, and others, those devices
represent a possible wealth of data."
Data, indeed...
Googles latest "new" venture is
but one more step in the merger between the "Internet of Things" and the
"Smart Grid," the solidification of the
surveillance state and eco-fascism
into one entity that itself is only part of a much larger agenda.
For those who are unaware of what the term "Smart Grid" means, the Smart
Grid is essentially a computerized system that allows the monitoring and
control over energy use from power at the plant source to every appliance in
the home.
Smart Grid technology is a mayor part
of UN
Agenda 21, the United Nations' plan to herd a drastically reduced
population into "human habitat areas," meaning ultra-modern super cities
with stack em and pack em dwelling structures and zero contact with nature
and the outside world.
The "Internet of Things," of course, is the
term used by disgraced former General and CIA Director David Petraeus
to describe the rise of gadgets which are connected and controlled by apps.
Petreaus himself
discussed the fact that, because of this
new technology, intelligence agencies will no longer need to place spy
devices
inside your home - you will do it for them.
As I
wrote in, "New
Report - Recording Everything Details how Governments can Shape The
Dynamics of Dissent," within the next few years, it will be possible for
the intelligence wing of the U.S. government to collect, store, and
centralize every type of data in existence on every human being in the
country, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for one year for a total cost
ranging in the few hundred thousands.
And this is only what has been announced. It
doesnt include the secret black projects that currently remain under wraps
or the fact that these
programs have been
ongoing for years.
Not only that, but with the open desire by the U.S. government to create a
Total Information Awareness network, as well as the legal infrastructure
such as the
Patriot Act and other
Big Brother legislation, a climate has been created where all of the
data acquired by "Smart" appliances will inevitably be soaked into this
government network.
Not only that, the snooping infrastructure is
such that one can assume that every piece of information that finds its way
into the Cloud will not eventually find its way to a centralized government
database, but will do so immediately.
The fact is, while even those few individuals who are still concerned with
their privacy complain about their constant loss of it, the all-too-familiar
warning of our descent into a world spoken of in George Orwells
1984
is often repeated ad nauseam.
However, one need only look around to understand
that we are not in danger of turning into the Orwellian surveillance state
in the near future.
We are already in it.
