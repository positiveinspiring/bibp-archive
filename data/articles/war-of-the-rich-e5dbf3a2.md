One simply has to listen to Senator
Bernie Sanders amazing speech.
He goes
right for the throat attacking the insanity of letting the top one percent
of the population take in more than 50 percent of the national income.
He
talks right into the dark evil of greed while the rest of the government and
most of the population just lets the most horrendous elements of humanity
literally have their way with us and our planet.
-
And we expect good things
to happen for us and our children?
-
Have we as a race gone mad?
-
Or is it just
the first world?
Americans certainly seem to have led the world into a new level of
depravity. Even with a growing list of billionaires offering to donate much
more of their money there is without question a cancer deep in the bowels of
humanity.
The ugly part is that it is all spilling out and its the common
men, women and children who take the biggest hit. In the United States whole
classes of people are going down hard. The poor, the middle class and even
the rich who have spent and borrowed beyond their means are all aboard a
plane that is crashing to earth.
When the dollar goes you will hear and feel
the crash all over the world.
For Americans themselves its a nightmare
scenario but it is not just them caught in the debt trap, its the whole
first world.
